"An escalating trade dispute between the Trump Administration and China could significantly impact California.Chinese Tariffs announced Monday are being slapped on our wine and agricultural industries.Sean Randolph is an expert on international trade and senior director with the Bay Area Council. He says, 'Everybody loses in a trade war and that is what we want to avoid from a California standpoint.'He is concerned about California's agriculture and wine industries. China has announced a 15 percent tariff on exports. The state's wine trade with China is small but growing, reportedly increasing 450 percent in the past decade.Michael Honig says his Napa Valley winery has been making inroads, as Asia's appetite for wine is expanding, especially with younger, more affluent Chinese.'We see China and other Asian markets as a great opportunity to grow for future generations, so any type of attack or tariff like that really puts us at a disadvantage,' Honig said.While China's relationship with this state's wine industry is relatively small, almonds, walnuts and pistachio's are huge. Pistachio growers in the San Joaquin valley shipped 140 million pounds to China and Hong Kong last year for an estimated $300 to $500 million in sales.Richard Matoian is the head of the American Pistachio Growers, which represents 700 growers, primarily in California. He says, 'Every year, we've been increasing the amount that we export to China. They have become the number one destination market.'Officials at the Port of Oakland are also concerned. California producers made up more than half of the port's farm shipments last year with China being one of the top export destinations.Experts say brace yourself -- this is likely just round one in the trade war.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Officer Heinrich Hiesinger resigned days after the company inked a deal with Tata Steel for a European steel joint venture that faced fierce investor opposition.The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committeeâ€™s June 12-13 gathering in Washington, released Thursday showed Fed officials reaffirming their commitment to gradually raising the benchmark lending rate amid rising risks from trade battles and emerging-market turmoil that could blunt the tailwind from fiscal policy.After having failed to take the disinvestment plan of Air India ahead, the Centre is now mulling to infuse fresh capital into the ailing airlines, said an official in the Ministry of Civil Aviation yesterday.

This report was compiled from agency feeds.US and China careen towards an outright trade war as President Donald Trump on Thursday said the United States may ultimately impose tariffs on more than a half-trillion dollarsâ€™ worth of Chinese goods as the worldâ€™s two largest economies hurtled toward the start of a trade war. Trump confirmed that the United States would begin collecting tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods at 12:01 a.m. US energy, agricultural and chemicals companies are girding for a summer standoff over trade. China has vowed to respond to any new tariffs, threatening to further escalate the trade conflict between the worldâ€™s two largest economies. China's state media on Friday, accused the White House of behaving like a â€œgang of hoodlums.â€?Petrol and diesel prices were hiked in India for the first time in more than a month on Thursday even as Saudi Arabia's state-run oil giant cut its prices for first time since February after President Donald Trump lashed out at the OPEC cartel of oil producers over rising US gas prices. The increase of 16 paisa a litre in petrol and 12 paisa per litre in diesel came after an 8-day self-imposed hiatus in rate revisions by state-oil firms. Meanwhile, Iran has said oil will soon cost $100 per barrel due to supply disruptions caused by U.S. President Donald Trump.

According to traders, price of S-30 grade sugar in Mumbai has increased to Rs 32 per kg on Tuesday from Rs 29/kg on June 28.

"Nearly 40 years have passed since President Deng Xiaoping announced a raft of economic reforms that initiated Chinaâ€™s economic opening up to the world.Professor Fan Gang, a prominent Chinese economist and reform advocate, reflected on the remarkable pace of change he has seen since that time at the launch of The China Update: Chinaâ€™s 40 Years of Reform and Development: 1978â€“2018, published by ANU Press.â€œWhen I was in the US for the first time some 30 years ago, the only commodity I saw with the label of â€˜made in Chinaâ€™ wasâ€¦ a basket on the floor,â€? he said.â€œNow the US and China have a trade war. Thatâ€™s remarkable. Itâ€™s kind of a landmark for these 40 years of changes, even if a trade war is not a good landmark.â€?Professor Fanâ€™s speech was one of many at the two-day China Update conference, which examines the economic development of Australiaâ€™s largest trading partner.Held at The Australian National University (ANU), the conference focused on the recent and controversial US-China trade war that pundits fear could also harm Australia, likely through fluctuations in the Australian dollar.â€œWhy the trade war that the US has initiated with China?â€? Professor Fan-Gang asked. â€œYou have a trade deficit, yes, but you can negotiate, you can talkâ€¦ so why the trade war?â€?â€œFirst of all, somebody believes that the trade deficit represents their losses and that the trade deficit is about other people taking advantage of the country. However, we know there are many more issues beyond the trade issue,â€? he added.Professor Fan attributed the recent escalation to Sino-US trade tensions to the Trump Administrationâ€™s push to â€œstop China from further economic developmentâ€?.â€œThe question is, how will China respond? They continue to say we need to negotiate, we need to cooperateâ€¦with the American government butâ€¦game theory says that you need â€˜tit-for-tatâ€™, at least for the beginning,â€? he said.â€œSome people say you can retaliate [toward] US companies, but US companies in China are Chinese companies. They are a part of the domestic economy andâ€¦ a large part of Chinaâ€™s export value â€“ a lot of goods â€“ are coming from foreign companies.â€?Despite this gloomy outlook, Professor Fan does see a positive side to the debacle, seeing it as an incentive for China to continue with much-needed economic reforms.â€œWhat the trade war tells us is that opening up is so important,â€? he said. â€œAll of our discussion about this book, every author, every contributor finds problems and things that China can improve further. And then China can be stronger and stand high for further globalisation and economic development,â€? he said.By CAP Student Correspondent Georgie Juszczyk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The French president isnâ€™t giving in to striking rail workers. China threatens the United States with tariffs.The moderate French Democratic Confederation of Labor (CFDT) has joined the hardline General Confederation of Labor (CGT) in weekly strikes against a proposed overhaul of the state railway company, yet President Emmanuel Macron shows no sign of budging.Most French voters support his effort to end generous employment terms for new â€” not existing â€” rail workers, including automatic pay rises and early retirement.That may change as travelers are exposed to frequent disruptions, but, as I argued here the other week, falling popularity is unlikely to keep Macron up at night. He has four years left for his reforms to start bearing fruit and there is no unified opposition against him.French political reformsMacron has also unveiled political reforms:Seats in both chambers of parliament would be cut by a third: from 577 to 404 in the National Assembly and from 348 to 243 in the Senate.Proportional representation would be introduced for 15 percent of the seats in the National Assembly, making it easier for small parties to win seats.Elected officials would be banned from running for office more than three times, except for the mayors of small towns.The reforms will almost certainly pass in the National Assembly, where Macron has an absolute majority. But they may be trickier to get through the Senate, where conservatives have the most seats.China retaliates in trade warChina has said it will retaliate with a 25-percent tariff on American aircraft, cars, chemicals, liquor, meat, soybeans and about 100 other products if President Donald Trump continues his trade war on the country.Earlier this week, Trump vowed to raise tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports.Revealing his ignorance of basic economics, the president tweeted, â€œWhen youâ€™re already $500 billion DOWN, you canâ€™t lose!â€? (Americaâ€™s trade deficit with China was $375 billion in 2017.)Of course Americans will lose. Tariffs might protect a few thousand jobs in manufacturing, but they will hurt tens of millions of consumers who buy cheap Chinese products as well as those who work in industries that export to China.Also read Ryan Bohl on the dangers of (insert your countryâ€™s name) first policies.Donâ€™t dismiss Trumpâ€™s war on AmazonEdward Luce argues not to underestimate Trumpâ€™s campaign against Jeff Bezos, the owner of Amazon and The Washington Post .Much of the Democratic Party supports the idea of breaking up the big tech companies.

"Chinaâ€™s retaliatory 25% trade tariffs on certain goods it imports from the US comes as no surprise. Whatâ€™s more interesting is how China has limited how the tariff applies to Boeing airliners.By setting a weight limit on the aircraft that are affected, Beijing has deliberately narrowed the scope of its US airliner tariff to the 737NG. While thatâ€™s still not a good situation for Boeing, the damage would have been much worse had it included the new 737 MAX or any of Boeingâ€™s widebodies. Chinese airlines have ordered hundreds of these.But Beijing also knows that its airlines need these aircraft if they are to continue to grow in line with market forecasts and in synch with Chinaâ€™s national aviation policy. China clearly understands that a strong, expanding air transport industry provides a stimulus to economic growth. Beijing wants both to continue.So the announcement today, restricting airliner tariffs to the 737NG, signals that Beijing is prepared to target the US commercial aircraft (and aero engine) industry, but also that it understand that its airlines need those new aircraft and canâ€™t get them all from Airbus.This gives Beijing the negotiating leverage to ratchet the trade war up or down, depending on how the Trump administration reacts to todayâ€™s announcement. By increasing the weight up a little on the airliner tariff, the MAX could be includedâ€”far more harmful to Boeing (but also more complicated for Chinese airlines with large MAX orders to deal with).The real target in Chinaâ€™s tariffs on US goods announced so far, however, is President Donald Trumpâ€™s core voter base. Itâ€™s not the airliner taxes that will do real damage on US soil, but all those 25% price hikes on soy beans, corn, cotton and other crops grown in rural Americaâ€”along with orange juice and beef productsâ€”where 2016 election voters mostly supported Trump.So Boeing becomes a pawn in the negotiations that will take place in a trade war that the White House started, but which Beijing will likely be a devilish-smart player to outplay.Best case, this trade skirmish fades away as the potential harm to Americaâ€™s farmers becomes obvious. Worst case, this becomes a poker game where the US not so much refuses to blink, but more looks away. In which case, as several US industry analysts have pointed out today, this escalates into a full-blown trade war that could trigger a global recession. In a statement issued by Boeing late April 4, the manufacturer acknowledged that this was the real danger posed by the Trump administrationâ€™s needless and reckless provocation of Beijing. â€œA strong and vibrant aerospace industry is important to the economic prosperity and national security of both countries,â€? Boeing said.For airliner manufacturersâ€”be they Airbus or Boeingâ€”an economic recession would be the worst outcome of all. Thatâ€™s the path toward aircraft order delays and cancelations.Karen Walker karen.walker@informa.com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Warner, Kaine: Escalating Trump trade war would hurt Virginia soybean production, jobsTwitter Facebook Google+ WhatsApp LinkedIn Pinterest EmailU.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) expressed increased concern over how President Trumpâ€™s trade war would hurt Virginiaâ€™s soybean production, which is the Commonwealthâ€™s number one cash crop.Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Commerce has recently announced they will begin proactively taxing Chinese companies that import some American agricultural products at 178.6% to discourage imports. The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) has confirmed that China is the Commonwealthâ€™s biggest export market for agricultural goods and suggested President Trumpâ€™s tariffs could hurt Virginia businesses and employees. Soybean production in Virginia accounts for roughly $187 million in economic output, which helps supports thousands of jobs in the Commonwealth. Amid escalating rhetoric by the Trump Administration, China announced that it is considering raising tariffs on soybeans, beef, and other critical agriculture commodities produced in Virginia.â€œVirginiaâ€™s soybean producers should not be held hostage to the uncertainty of President Trumpâ€™s trade games,â€? said Sen. Warner. â€œWhile China should be held accountable for its unfair trade practices, this should not be done at the expense of the hardworking soybean farmers in this country. President Trump needs to work with us to find the best way to resolve these disputes and avoid threatening an industry that creates thousands of new jobs and brings millions of dollars to rural communities in Virginia.â€?â€œClearly China is not taking President Trumpâ€™s threats lightly and weâ€™re going to start feeling the pain of his rash actions. Our farmers deserve better than this,â€? said Sen. Kaine. â€œPresident Trump says he wants to create jobs and stimulate the economy yet his actions will have the opposite effect. His inflammatory, bullying tactics are going to hurt Virginians.â€?â€œExports are a vital source of income for Virginiaâ€™s farmers and here in the Commonwealth we have worked hard to open new markets around the world for our agriculture and forestry exporters. However, these efforts are jeopardized by threats of tariffs and trade wars at the national level,â€? said Bettina Ring, Virginia Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry. â€œI hope that our trade negotiators will keep our hardworking farmers and agribusinesses front of mind when working with their Chinese counterparts to solve this trade dispute.â€?â€œThe Virginia Soybean Association is concerned with the potential of trade wars within the global marketplace, including China. International trade is vital for the economic viability of the soybean industry,â€? said Nick Moody, President of the Virginia Soybean Association. â€œUncertainty in trade agreements directly affect the stability of markets and price, which is a major concern for producers in a business that is already largely dependent on weather. Our hope is for the administration to work with leaders in international markets to create solid solutions to these trade disputes, which will not continue to disrupt soybean markets.â€?According to VDACS, agriculture is Virginiaâ€™s largest private industry, with an economic impact of $70 billion annually that provides more than 334,000 jobs. The agriculture and forestry industries combined have a total economic impact of over $91 billion and provide more than 442,000 jobs in the Commonwealth. Every job in agriculture and forestry supports 1.7 jobs elsewhere in Virginiaâ€™s economy. Production agriculture alone employs 54,000 Virginians and accounts for more than $3.8 billion in economic output. Almost 10 percent of Virginiaâ€™s gross domestic product (GDP) is directly tied to agriculture and forestry.Sens. Warner and Kaine previously raised concerns about how President Trumpâ€™s trade war with China could hurt Virginia businesses and employees, listing the set of products grown and made in Virginia that have been targeted by the Chinese for duties. They also wrote to the Administration last week warning that withdrawing from the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)â€”another significant source of agricultural exports for Virginiaâ€”would negatively impact Virginiaâ€™s agricultural industry.Below is a detailed list of soybean producing areas in Virginia as of 2017.

"Warner, Kaine on Trump trade warTwitter Facebook Google+ WhatsApp LinkedIn Pinterest EmailU.S. Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine released the following statement on President Trumpâ€™s trade war, which has resulted in China imposing tariffs today on Virginia goods.â€œChina engages in unfair trade actions that must be addressed, but today, President Trumpâ€™s mishandling of the trade situation caused China to officially retaliate against the U.S. by placing tariffs on $34 billion worth of American goods.

"Its complaint to the organization, which oversees global trade rules, comes less than one week after the USA government proposed 10 percent tariffs on a $200 billion list of Chinese goods, to take effect in September at the earliest.Referring to US accusations on China stealing intellectual property, Hua said it is a serious distortion of reality, as China is firmly implementing an innovation-driven development strategy.The WTO gives countries broad leeway to determine national security interests.Various delegations had particularly highlighted the latter concern, with some arguing that the state's strong role in the economy, or in some cases insufficient involvement, were complicating efforts from businesses based overseas in developing deeper ties with Beijing, according to a Geneva trade official familiar with the meeting.The tariff hikes targeting Chinese goods were based on Section 301 of the United States Trade Act of 1974, its domestic trade law.Membership in the WTO has been part of China's rise to global economic influence since it joined in 2001.There were also calls from various members, however, for China to improve its subsidy notification records and other transparency efforts related to trade, and to move towards a 'more market-oriented approach to investment and resource allocation'.

"Rumblings of a China-U.S. trade war could boost the prospects of Canadian industries, but it would also cause global disruptions and force Canadians to defend their markets against heightened American competition.China announced tariffs Wednesday against U.S. plans to apply US$50 billion worth of tariffs on 106 imports by issuing a list of U.S. goods including soybeans, whisky, beef, industrial chemicals and small aircraft in the escalating dispute.Thatâ€™s on top of import charges announced Monday on 128 items including fruit, nuts, pork, ginseng, wine, steel pipe and aluminum scrap in retaliation for an estimated US$3 billion in U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum.Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland warned on Wednesday the global trading order that Canada helped create faces its most â€œfraughtâ€? moment threat since the Second World War, if the China-U.S. trade war escalates.The global trading order established after the Second World War was a development that laid the foundation for the peace and prosperity that much of the world currently enjoys, she said during a panel discussion in Winnipeg Wednesday.The trade spat had a â€œvery muted effect on the (Canadian) market,â€? Derek Holt, analyst at The Bank of Nova Scotia said. The agricultural sector dealt with minor losses, with corn down 2 per cent, but the Canadian currency has not been too affected, which is where you would see the negatives, he said.This is partly because â€œrate pressures are on hold and thatâ€™s providing a little bit of a safety valve,â€? Holt added.The Canadian dollar was trading at 77.99 cents U.S., down from an average price of 78.05 cents U.S. The Toronto Stock Exchange was slightly down on the day, paring losses earlier in the day.When it comes to protecting its industry, Canada has a few tools to tinker with, according to Holt. It can manage trade policy risks with monetary policy, and absorb negative shocks that could emerge from adverse trade policy developments. Thatâ€™s as long as â€œcooler heads prevailâ€? in the market, he said.Meanwhile, Soy Canada executive director Ron Davidson says the latest 25 per cent levy on U.S. goods could create some opportunities for Canadian exporters, but will also force Canada to fend off imports at home and defend sales to 69 other markets.â€œWhat weâ€™re looking at here is substantive instability in the world market while we try to sort out where everybodyâ€™s beans are going,â€? he said in an interview.Davidson said Canadian exporters including Richardson International Ltd., Cargill Ltd. and Viterra Inc. wouldnâ€™t want to hurt long-term connections with foreign markets just to sell more to China.Canada sold nearly five million tonnes of soybean products valued at $2.7 billion to China last year.The group representing Canadaâ€™s beef and pork producers also sees big growth opportunities in China and Asia but says a ramp down of American exports to China would boost competition with them in other markets.â€œThe tariff certainly changes the landscape a little bit but China still remains a very viable market for Canadian exports,â€? said Marcus Mattinson, spokesman for the Canadian Meat Council.Canadian red meat exports to China surged to $835 million in 2016, up from $334 million in 2010.The country accounts for about 13 per cent of total Canadian exports.On top of that, the rebooted Trans-Pacific Partnership could facilitate the enhanced penetration into Pacific Rim countries.Mattinson said meat producers are monitoring the trade dispute between the worldâ€™s two largest economies.â€œBut we will continue to work with our government stakeholders and partners to make sure that Canadaâ€™s meat supply chain continues to benefit from international trade.â€?Corinne Pohlmann, senior vice-president of national affairs and partnerships at the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, that represents more than 110,000 businesses, said she recommends small businesses to diversify away from the U.S. market. Canadaâ€™s trade deals with the European Union is another new area to explore, she said.However, the potential slowdown could hit Canadian firms that rely on the construction and building activity that comes with economic growth, especially those with greater international exposure.Meanwhile, prices for key industrial metals like iron ore and copper have already dipped on fears of the trade war and could drop farther still as any slowdown in the global economy would hit at the margins.Slowing growth could have a knock-on effect on oil demand, with crude prices dipping after the latest tariff announcement. Shares of smaller producers and service companies that rely on continued growth have been hit, while large producers which are focused more on steady production than growth have been more isolated from such dips.With Chinese tariffs targeting U.S. agricultural products like apples and soybeans, Canadian producers are concerned that U.S. output will start flooding north in search of markets. Ontario apple farmers have already raised alarms at the potential effects on prices while Soy Canada says the tariffs will cause global disruptions and uncertainty.Amid the disruption, Canada consumers may end up paying more for U.S. products and less for Chinese goods. U.S. beer and automobiles would likely cost more as the Chinese tariffs reverberates through the U.S. industries, according to Jean Simard, president of the Aluminum Association of Canada.Soli@postmedia.comWith files from The Canadian Press",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By David Ficklingâ€œA WISE GENERAL makes a point of foraging on the enemy,â€? according to the Chinese general Sun Tzu. â€œOne cartload of the enemyâ€™s provisions is equivalent to 20 of oneâ€™s own.â€?The lesson of that maxim â€” that leaders need to pay close attention to the economics of conflict, and make sure that costs are imposed more on the enemy than the home front â€” holds as true today as it did two and a half millennia ago. Washington doesnâ€™t appear to be listening.The White Houseâ€™s promise to impose 10% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods on top of the existing $50 billion issued this week â€” with an option to add a further $200 billion on top of that â€” would put almost the entirety of the USâ€™ $526 billion of imports from China in jeopardy.That may look like a strong move.China, with only $155 billion or so of imports from the US, simply doesnâ€™t have enough trade to respond in kind. In truth, however, the big numbers conceal some deep weaknesses.To see why, consider Sun Tzu.The initial lists put out by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer have been surgical in targeting only goods that can avoid a widespread popular backlash against President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade policies. Most of the 1,102 products on the latest tally are intermediate goods such as storage heaters and lubricating oils, whose raised costs are unlikely ever to directly hit consumersâ€™ hip pockets.The exceptions threatened to date have tended to be rarely purchased durable goods (such as the washing machines that have risen 17% in price since tariffs were imposed in a separate move in January), or products such as flat-screen televisions that have become dramatically cheaper over the past decade.In both cases, the products are ones where average Americans might be expected to initially miss the pain of rising costs â€” and even flat-screen TVs were removed from Lighthizerâ€™s most recent list after consultation with industry.In other words, Lighthizer has been ensuring that his trade armies forage on the enemy. The tariffs will hurt the revenues of Chinese exporters, as higher prices damp demand while US wholesalers switch to other countries wherever substitution is possible. By avoiding swathes of consumer products, meanwhile, heâ€™s limited the risk of popular discontent.The problem is that the US is at a strategic disadvantage on this front. As weâ€™ve written before, Chinaâ€™s exports to the US tend to be consumer goods, while trade in the opposite direction is weighted toward raw materials and intermediate parts. That means Lighthizer is already close to or past the limit where he can raise prices on Chinese products without American voters noticing.What are the next major categories of goods where the US can impose further tariffs? Mobile phones, with $73 billion of imports from China in 2017, would be next on the list, followed by computers and accessories; furniture and mattresses; toys and games; clothing and shoes; and televisions. The six categories together amount to another $273 billion.Such action would smack Middle America between the eyes, and Washington could be expected to do its utmost to avoid it. But the wiggle room is limited, as the Council on Foreign Relationsâ€™ Brad Setser has pointed out. While itâ€™s possible in theory to compile the next $200 billion hit list by imposing levies on almost every traded item other than those big six consumer categories, thereâ€™s no way to reach Trumpâ€™s final total without doing so.Look at how the two commanders-in-chief are arraying their armies and you should be concerned about Americaâ€™s ability to withstand attack.The careful curation of Lighthizerâ€™s existing lists suggests a general aware of his weaknesses on the home front who is following orders from a commander oblivious to the risks. Should the trade war begin in earnest, Washington had better be ready with an explanation for the rising cost of living and decline in farm exports ahead of Novemberâ€™s midterm elections.Meanwhile, Chinaâ€™s domestic industrial machine â€” which managed to offset the wrenching export declines from the 2008 financial crisis without pushing economic growth below 6% â€” is roaring in readiness.Steel production in May rose 12% from a year earlier, the fastest pace in five years, while thermal electricity output climbed 10%. That stimulus may worsen Chinaâ€™s economic imbalances and harm the global climate, but â€” combined with the relative immunity from popular anger youâ€™d expect in an authoritarian state â€” should keep the nation strong as the trade battle heats up.It may well be that the White Houseâ€™s latest threat is no more than a gambit. Americaâ€™s consumers had better hope so. If not, the front line of this conflict is coming to their hip pockets.BLOOMBERG",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Senator Dan Zumbach said Senator Joni Ernst is in talks with President Trump on how the tariffs could impact farmers in Iowa if negotiations do not happen with China.Iowa farmers said it is hard to imagine losing their relationship with China, which is the world's top importer of soybeans. The country imports more than 30 percent of their soybeans from the U.S. In Iowa, farmers export about 25 percent of their bushels there.'If they put a 25% tariff on soybeans, well that just makes our soybeans too expensive for them to buy, and this is a market we've been building on for the last 35 years,' said farmer Lindsay Greiner. Greiner is also the President-Elect of the Iowa Soybean Association.This week, China first threatened tariffs on pork and ethanol after President Trump unveiled a proposed $50 billion in tariffs to Chinese goods.On Wednesday, China threatened to put a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion in U.S. goods, which included soybeans.The Trump Administration has since responded to China's agricultural levies, saying $100 billion more in Chinese goods could face tariffs.Yet, Iowa Republican Senator Dan Zumbach said this push back does not necessarily mean farmers should be worried.'Now the process isn't as comfortable as a lot of people would like to see it done, but I think his end result is what we need to keep the focus on,' he said.Right now, Zumbach said any economic impact on the price of agricultural products is because both countries have not yet come to a fair deal.'Everybody is responding and reacting to emotion, but the problem is that emotion has caused hogs to go from nearly 50 or 60 cents a pound down to 35 cents a pound. This is a real, direct, economic impact,' said Zumbach.On Friday, State Senator Chuck Grassley warned that fighting tariffs with tariffs could still lead to a costly outcome in Iowa.'It's a chess game. It's kind of a dangerous thing to be doing. You got to know what you're doing. You've got to be careful doing it because if it goes wrong, agriculture is going to be the one first hurt by it,' said Grassley.'If we do actually end up in a trade war, and people are hurt where it hurts, in their pocketbook, I think it could be politically pretty bad for Trump's Administration,' said Greiner.Senator Zumbach, who is also Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee said he spoke with Senator Joni Ernst this week. He said Ernst is in talks with President Trump on how the tariffs could impact farmers in Iowa if negotiations do not happen with China.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By Abrahm HurtTheStatehouseFile.comINDIANAPOLIS â€” Phil Ramsey, owner of Ramsey Farms in Shelbyville, is nervous about how a potential trade war with China would affect him.In March, President Donald Trump announced he would impose tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum. China responded by announcing it would target American products, such as pork, beef, cars and soybeans with tariffs.Tariffs could carry large consequences in states like Indiana that largely supported Trump in the 2016 general election.The potential tariffs have raised concerns in the farming community because it is unknown how they would affect the price of crops at a time when they are already down.Trump has pledged to help farmers, but he has yet to offer any specific solution of plan.â€œChina is our number one importer of soybeans, and one-third of all soybean production in the United States goes to China,â€? Ramsey said. â€œAs you drive down the road and look at our fields, every third row is going to be put on a boat and go to China.â€?Ramsey farms on a corn and soybean rotation. Fifty percent of his crops are soybeans, and he said at least half of his income comes from that product. They are on 1,800 acres of land.Soybeans are the second largest commodity in Indiana, totaling $2.84 billion in sales in 2016, according to United States Department of Agricultureâ€™s National Agricultural Statistics Service. Indiana ranked fourth overall in the nation in soybean production and exports in 2016, sending $1.7 billion of the product overseas.Bob White, director of national government relations for Indiana Farm Bureau, said a potential trade war with China could be disastrous to Indiana and United State farming, especially given the current state of agriculture.â€œWeâ€™re off 50 percent of net income from five years ago according to Purdue and USDA,â€? White said. â€œWeâ€™ve got a down ag economy and that will make this outlook just look even bleaker.â€?Ramsey said the proposed tariffs are just another uncertainty like the weather, but they could have a large impact on the American farmer.â€œWhen you throw something this big into the market, we can have some pretty wide, dramatic swings in the price and you really donâ€™t know what to do.â€?Ben Gavelek, communications director for the Indiana State Department of Agriculture, did not have an answer as to how the tariffs would affect agriculture products like soybeans.He said the department is still in the process of determining the impact of the tariffs on Indiana agriculture.Ramsey said he supported tariffs that are actually necessary.â€œI understand that they are needed to even out trade issues, monetary issues and sometimes theyâ€™re maybe needed to help level the playing field,â€? he said. â€œBut when theyâ€™re used as a retaliatory measure, thatâ€™s really when it becomes a difficult problem.â€?He also said he was concerned about who would buy soybeans from the U.S. if China does not because South America already sells more beans to China than the U.S. does.â€œThe last thing you want to do is lose market share to anybody else,â€? Ramsey said. â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter what kind of business youâ€™re in, you donâ€™t want to lose market share. Itâ€™s always much more expensive to get a new customer than it is to take care of your current customers.â€?Dr. Laura Merrifield Wilson, professor of political science at the University of Indianapolis, said even though it might be far-fetched, a trade war with China could affect House and Senate elections in Indiana.Wilson said voters might react if they see the tariffs have a negative impact on the local economy.â€œIf people make that connection and they understand that when theyâ€™re voting, it could adversely impact the Republican candidates running.â€?Abrahm Hurt is a reporter for TheStatehouseFile.com, a news website powered by Franklin College journalism students.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Defiant in the face of increasing fears about the impact to the USA economy, Trump has threatened to go after all imports from China if the country refuses to change policies he says harm United States industry, particularly the theft of American technology.LONDON - European and Asian markets were lower on Monday after China said it won't negotiate with the U.S. on trade if the Trump administration continues to threaten higher tariffs.China imports far less from the United States, making a dollar-for-dollar match on any new U.S. tariffs impossible.On Monday, US imposed a 10 percent tax on 6,000 Chinese goods, ranging from rice and textiles to clothes and manufacturing goods. The spat between the United States and China further encouraged the markets to move to the USA dollar over gold. China is poised to retaliate with tariffs on US$60 billion in United States goods, a move that Mr Trump has said would spur new duties on another US$267 billion in Chinese imports. Beijing cancelled the visit of a Chinese negotiating team expected September 27-28 in Washington, The Wall Street Journal said.'While these actions seem to be already priced in, investors are becoming increasingly anxious that the trade war may enter phase III', Hussein Sayed, the chief market strategist at trading platform FXTM, said in an email on Monday morning. A state-owned Chinese bank is helping with the project's financing, and a state-owned Chinese energy company is meant to buy much of its production.Efforts at diplomacy have failed, with no breakthroughs since high-level talks began in May.Maine Protesters Want Susan Collins To Take A Stand On Brett KavanaughThe letter was written on a large poster board and signed by ME survivors of sexual assault and their supporters.

Bryce Conrad, the president of Hydro Ottawa, said some areas would not have power on Monday or this week.Attack aftermath: Iran president says USA wants to cause insecurityTehran believes that Saudi Arabia is behind the attack, encouraged by the United States and Israel . Iranian leaders accused the United States of complicity in the attacks in Ahvaz.The latest volley against Beijing brings the amount of goods hit by duties to more than US$250 billion, about half of China's USA exports, with USA consumers set to increasingly feel the pain.Still, the USA remains open to talks, Lindsay Walters, deputy White House press secretary, said. In fact, Trump revels in it. Trump got himself elected in large part on a promise to get tough with China and other trading partners to reverse the damage done to American manufacturing over the last several decades.The white paper came as a fresh round of tariffs came into force against Chinese goods coming into the US. Another US$16 billion of goods were included in August and China retaliated in kind to both moves.Separately on Monday, Australian investment bank Macquarie said that Mexico stands to benefit the most from rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China. 'This latest tranche is a tsunami', said Hun Quach, vice-president of worldwide trade for the Retail Industry Leaders Association.But officials say Beijing will soon run out of U.S. goods to impose tariffs on. Though Beijing has not revealed what such steps might be, business executives and analysts say it could withhold exports of certain products to the U.S. or create more administrative red tape for American companies operating in China.Trump earlier this month accused China of targeting rural voters who support his presidency by hitting agricultural goods. 'Unless that happens, serious negotiations will be impossible and the likelihood of continued escalation increases', Mr Alden said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BEIJING: At least three US coal shipments on their way to China may end up casualties of the escalating trade dispute after Beijing said it would impose steep tariffs that may kick in before the ships reach their destinations.The addition of coal to the list of more than 650 items facing higher tariffs came as a shock to Chinese steel mills and trading firms that just last month were encouraged by Beijing to buy more US coal to narrow the trade gap, four sources with knowledge of the plan said.Although 545 items on the list face higher tariffs starting July 6, Beijing did not specify when coal and the other remaining items would be hit.But coalâ€™s presence on the list has sent shudders through the market.â€œI am really worried. I havenâ€™t found buyers interested in these cargoes now,â€? said the manager of Shanghai Runhe International Trade Co, which has three shipments of US coking coal en route to China.He said Runhe had paid for the coal up front rather than using letters of credit from banks.â€œWho knows what Trump is going to do next? In the worst scenario, we lost some money,â€? he added. He declined to be named because of company policy.A cargo of U.S. coking coal, depending on the size of the vessel, can be worth $10 million to $30 million.From late 2014 until January 2017, China bought no coal from the United States, as it typically costs more, takes longer to arrive and is of lower quality than Australian coal.Purchases resumed at a lower level after President Donald Trump took office, Thomson Reuters Eikon data show. Replacing American shipments with coal from other places would not be difficult, the sources said.Wang, a private coal trader who had planned to buy U.S. coal from Runhe, said he was changing course.â€œThat plan is now completely off the table,â€? said Wang, who is based in Rizhao.â€œWe were mystified by the trade policies. In May, my reading of the policy was that China is to step up U.S. coal buying to contribute to imports,â€? he added. Wang declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the topic.He is not the only one alarmed.An executive with the trading arm of a major Chinese building materials company said it had stopped talks with U.S. coal producers.â€œWe resumed our talks with U.S. coal producers recently,â€? the executive said. â€œBut our talks are stopped now.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A trade war and a new Cold War are threatening to rip apart the global economy. Thatâ€™s the springtime message from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.Bankers and finance ministers from the IMFâ€™s 189 member countries met in Washington, DC, on the 10th anniversary of the global financial crisis.And although optimistic about economic growth over the next couple of years, the IMF warns that ageing populations, lackluster productivity, rising debt and the possibility of a global trade war could lead to a downturn.â€œWhile the sun is shining, we are seeing more clouds accumulating on the horizon than we did back in October. Global debt is at an all-time high,â€? said Christine Lagarde, the IMFâ€™s managing director.According to the IMF, global debt came in at $164 trillion in 2016, a historic peak.The IMF bails out failing economies and tries to create financial stability, while the World Bank lends to poor and middle-income countries.Together these two United Nations institutions aim to raise global living standards. But thereâ€™s danger ahead, even if the world economy is projected to grow by 3.6 percent in 2018.Assessing the IMFâ€™s report card, it provided a â€œfairly positive picture,â€? says Gregor Irwin, chief economist at Global Counsel. â€œGlobal prospects are good, one or two clouds on the horizon, concerns about protectionism, concerns about financial vulnerabilities in China.â€?Irwin believes Chinaâ€™s rising debt as well as a looming trade war between China and the US could pose a threat to the global economy.â€œGrowth prospects remain good in China, nobodyâ€™s expecting a major slowdown tomorrow in Chinese growth, but the big concern about China is that debt to GDP is still rising. Itâ€™s projected to rise further still, and itâ€™s very high by the standards of other countries or by historical standards, and frankly it looks unsustainable. So that is a genuine concern over the next few years over the stability of the global economy.â€?Irwin says that the US and China â€œare not in a trade war yet, but thereâ€™s a risk of a trade war. One of the concerns about a trade war is it wouldnâ€™t just involve the US and China, but it would inevitably drag in other countries as well and theyâ€™d be caught up in the crossfire between the US and China. Right now, I think it would be fair to describe US policy as unpredictable and also quite aggressive. Equally, I think when you look at Chinaâ€™s policy stands â€“ also what the Europeans might do if there are any measures targeting China, I think we can expect to see retaliation, and thatâ€™s where the trade war scenario really begins to potentially become a real one.â€?Also on this episode of Counting the Cost:Cubaâ€™s post-Castro era: Cubaâ€™s president Raul Castro has passed on the baton to his chosen successor, Miguel Diaz Canel.

President Canel has some tough challenges ahead, as Latin America editor Lucia Newman reports from Havana.Saudi Arabia oil: Reports say Saudi Arabia would like to see oil prices at $80-100 a barrel. The kingdom needs $83 a barrel to balance the budget. And it wants to give a boost to its oil giant Aramco, before a widely anticipated IPO. A deal between Saudi Arabia and Russia to limit global oil supply to 1.8m barrels a day has worked. The world is no longer drowning in oil. But the fear among other producers is that higher oil prices will throw off the delicate balance of supply and demand and drive up US shale production.China censorship: A public outcry in China forced its most popular social media network to reverse a decision to ban gay content online. Sina Weibo, Chinaâ€™s equivalent of Twitter, received a backlash when it blocked videos and comics referring to homosexuality. The gay community is cautiously welcoming the development, as Adrian Brown reports from Beijing.Netflix: Netflix added 7.4 million more subscribers between January and March this year â€“ the fastest growth in its history.

"A few days ago I read something about Wisconsin cranberry farmers facing a very bad year because of Trump's trade war. Retaliation is a bitch. Maine is the top cranberry producer in the U.S.There are 20 counties across the state that grow cranberries. Wood, Jackson, Monroe and Juneau are the top producers. All of them are losing jobs now. They all voted for SeÃ±or Job Producer in 2016:â€¢ Wood- 57.0% to 37.7%â€¢ Jackson- 53.3% to 41.5%â€¢ Juneau- 61.2% to 39.1%â€¢ Monroe- 58.5% to 36.0%Trump won the state's 10 electoral votes 1,409,467 (47.9%) to 1,382,210 (46.9%). So close. I bet Hillary wouldn't have started any trade wars. Cranberries are bad enough but that's not the only sector in Wisconsin suffering under Trump's brilliant trade strategy. Harley Davidson is the one everyone is talking about. Milwaukee is where Harley has it's corporate headquarters and the bikes are made in Ryan's district. Aluminum boats are another important business in Wisconsin in trouble.Boat manufacturers say the escalating trade dispute with China took another bad turn this week that could scuttle sales of aluminum boats popular in Wisconsin.In the billions of dollars of tariffs that Trumpâ€™s administration has proposed on Chinese goods, a new tariff of 167 percent on the type of aluminum used for recreational boats would bring the total tariff on that product to at least 210 percent.â€œThis is terrible news for marine manufacturers as aluminum boats represent 44 percent of new boat sales each year and account for $3 billion in retail sales,â€? Thom Dammrich, president of the Chicago-based National Marine Manufacturers, said Wednesday.â€œThese tariffs are disrupting the global aluminum market and increasing the cost of raw materials for U.S. manufacturers,â€? Dammrich said.In addition, roughly 300 component parts commonly used in recreational boats are now subject to a 25 percent tariff following a recent announcement of Section 301 tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese products.Canada, the European Union and Mexico-- which account for 69 percent of annual U.S. boat exports-- have announced retaliatory tariffs on boats of 10 percent, 25 percent and 15 percent respectively.â€œIn an attempt to punish China, the administration is wreaking havoc on the global economy. These harmful policies will have costly effects across American industries, but few to none are being singled out quite like the U.S. recreational boating industry,â€? Dammrich said.The U.S. recreational marine industry supports 650,000 jobs and last year had $37 billion in sales.Year after year, Wisconsin ranks in the top 10 states in sales of new powerboats, engines and accessories. Wisconsin also is home to Mercury Marine and Evinrude, two of the largest manufacturers of outboard engines.Many U.S. boat makers use domestic aluminum, but the tariffs on Chinese material will push up the prices globally, according to Dammrich.If rising aluminum and steel prices harm powerboat sales, by pricing some consumers out of the market, itâ€™s going to send a wave across the boating industry, he said.â€œIf you donâ€™t sell as many boats, then you donâ€™t sell as many engines, electronics and everything else.'Yesterday, CNN reported that 'Harley-Davidson's move is some of the most direct evidence yet that tit-for-tat trade fights between the United States and other countries have consequences for American companies. Harley-Davidson said it stood to lose as much as $100 million a year. 'Increasing international production to alleviate the EU tariff burden is not the company's preference, but represents the only sustainable option,' Harley-Davidson said in a regulatory filing on Monday... Europe is its second-largest market behind the United States. In 2017, nearly 40,000 European customers bought new Harleys, compared with about 148,000 in the United States.'After the idiot's tweet this morning, the Washington Post reported that he threatened Harley-Davidson 'with severe taxes and predicted a public revolt that he said would eventually put the 115-year-old firm out of business, blasting the Wisconsin company for a plan to move some operations outside the United States as a way to avoid getting caught in the middle of an escalating trade war.'may be IS a rubber stamp for Trump no matter what it does to his constituents... but Randy Bryce is the polar opposite.

China has already started an investigation of US exports of sorghum to China, after the solar panel tariffs, as a hint of what might be yet to come should the US pursue further sanctions. $14.2 billion is a little over 10% of 2016 total agricultural exports of $140 billion.

"As the trade war between China and the United States rage on, several reports claiming that the Asian superpower is seriously considering to ease up some of its sanctions against North Korea were recently published. Many analysts said that should U.S. President Donald Trump continues to push China to the side, China might want to reevaluate its stance against one of the biggest threat to the United States: North Korea.One of the first proponents of this idea is Eurasia Group director for Asia operations Scott Seaman. Mr. Seaman said that the more President Trump bully China in the economic front, it might drive China to cooperate less with North Korea.Mr. Seaman noted that China has already made some steps in relaxing the enforcement of some of its sanctions against North Korea way before the trade war started. However, as the trade war continues to hurt the economies of both nations, China could be persuaded to look for alternative reasons in order to relax its enforcement of North Korean sanctions.This is not the first time China is suggesting to ease up sanctions against North Korea. China, along with Russia, has flaunted this possibility to the United Nations in September.China and the United States are currently embroiled in a bitter trade war that has seen more than $250 billion worth of tariffs slapped against various Chinese goods. President Trump even threatens to hike up the tariff to reach $500 billion. As part of its retaliatory strategy, China, in turn, imposed $110 billion worth of tariff against American imports.Regarding North Korea, the hermetic state has recently held talks with South Korea and the United Nations Command on Tuesday. This is the first three-way talks involving the three parties. The main topic of the talk is to discuss ways on how to demilitarize the border which is dividing the two Koreas.After the meeting in the United Nations, North Korea's state-owned media released a scathing criticism of President Trump claiming that he is blocking the progress made between the two Koreas.

"The United States runs a $375 billion goods trade deficit with China.WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China, although his action was far removed from threats that could have ignited a global trade war.Under the terms of the memorandum, Trump will target the Chinese imports only after a consultation period, a measure that will give industry lobbyists and legislators a chance to water down a proposed target list which runs to 1,300 products.China will also have space to respond to Trumpâ€™s actions, reducing the risk of immediate dramatic retaliation from Beijing, and Trump struck an emollient tone as he started speaking, saying â€œI view them as a friend.â€?â€œWe have spoken to China and we are in the middle of negotiations,â€? Trump said, adding that loss of American jobs from unfair trade was one of the main reasons he had been elected in 2016.The United States runs a $375 billion goods trade deficit with China.Washington will also pursue alleged breaches of intellectual property law by China through the World Trade Organization, a body that has repeatedly drawn the ire of the administration, but which could provide a resolution that avoids a trade war.Global stocks had sold off on Thursday on the expectation of tough action from Trump, with US markets down as much as 2%, but recovered somewhat after the announcement.Following Trumpâ€™s announcement on Thursday, the US Trade Representativeâ€™s office will present a list of products that could be targeted, primarily from the high-tech sector. There will then be a 60-day consultation period before definitive action will be put into force.CHINESE INVESTMENTSWhite House officials told a briefing ahead of the trade announcement that the administration was eyeing tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods. They said the figure was based on a calculation of the impact on the profits of US companies that had been forced to hand over their intellectual property as the price of doing business in China.There was no explanation of the difference between the numbers provided by White House officials in the briefing and Trumpâ€™s $60 billion.â€œMany of these areas are those where China has sought to acquire advantage through the unfair acquisition and forced technology transfer from US companies ... establishing its own competitive advantage in an unfair manner,â€? Everett Eissenstat, deputy director of the National Economic Council, told reporters.In addition, Trump will also direct the US Treasury to propose measures that could restrict Chinese investments in the United States, Eissenstat said.The tariffs and investment restrictions will be imposed under the US Trade Representativeâ€™s â€œSection 301â€? investigation into alleged misappropriation of US intellectual property by China.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Los Angeles Times: The trade war is starting to show up in company earningsPicture: AFPLast spring, companies warned that the Trump administrationâ€™s steel and aluminum tariffs could hit their bottom line. Now the bill is starting to come due, thewrites.Several big manufacturers and consumer goods companies have cited growing trade tensions as factors for their lower-than-expected financial results in the just-ended second quarter.On Wednesday, General Motors Co. updated its full-year guidance and noted the â€œunfavorable impact of rising commodity costs,â€? saying the â€œrecent and significantâ€? price increases â€œnegatively affected business expectations.â€?GM said those higher commodity costs cut its earnings by $300 million in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. The company cut its earnings guidance for the year by $1 billion. GMâ€™s stock price fell nearly 5% on Wednesday.The same day, Ford Motor Co. executives said the second quarter was â€œchallenging,â€? partly because of higher commodity costs and â€œtariff-related impacts.â€? The company reported revenue of $38.9 million, compared to $39.8 million during the same period a year ago.A day earlier, appliance manufacturer Whirlpool Corp. said tariffs were a reason its results fell short of expectations. Excluding non-cash charges related to its overseas business, earnings fell to $3.20 a share from $3.35 a year earlier, and sales fell 4%, to $5.1 billion from $5.3 billion.Whirlpool Chief Executive Marc Bitzer cited weaker-than-expected U.S. demand for its appliances and â€œheadwinds related to U.S. tariffsâ€? that helped drive up prices of steel and other raw materials costs. Whirlpool shares closed 3.7% lower.â€œThe tariffs affect companies in two ways,â€? said Larry Harris, professor of finance at USCâ€™s Marshall School of Business. â€œIt increases the cost of items that they buy from abroad that the U.S. government has now placed a tariff on. It also increases the cost to foreigners of the items they sell abroad. Both effects reduce [companiesâ€™] earnings.â€?President Trump announced plans in March for a 10% duty on aluminum and a 25% tariff on steel imports from the European Union, Canada, China and Mexico. Several countries vowed to retaliate with their own tariffs.Shortly after the Commerce Department urged Trump in February to consider the tariffs, the weekly price of steel and aluminum increased. The price increase, at least for aluminum, likely flowed to equipment manufacturers, such as Whirlpool, by late in the second quarter, said Doug Hilderhoff, principal analyst in aluminum at CRU.Campbell Soup Co. warned financial analysts in May that its margins could take a hit in the year starting in August due to the anticipated import tariffs. An executive from the Camden, N.J., firm said on an earnings call then that the company expected to see â€œdouble-digit increasesâ€? on steel and aluminum, â€œall of it driven by the impact of anticipated tariffs.â€?By late June, motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc. said it would move some production out of the United States to avoid tariffs levied by the EU. On a Tuesday earnings call about the companyâ€™s second-quarter results, Chief Executive Matthew Levatich described that decision as â€œkeyâ€? to â€œprotect[ing] the marketplace and our customer value equation as well as our dealer business model.â€?Company executives said at the time that they expect the cost of the tariffs this year to be $45 million to $50 million and, because of that, lowered their earnings guidance for this year.â€œWe are doing everything we can at the company to absorb on the costs that we can,â€? John Olin, Harley-Davidsonâ€™s chief financial officer, said on the call. â€œAs we look forward, we canâ€™t eat the whole $45 million to $50 million or canâ€™t cover it in other parts of our business. And for that, we are bringing down our guidance.â€?On Tuesday, Bitzer of Whirlpool said â€œuncertainty related to tariffs and global trade actionsâ€? led to increased costs for â€œcertain strategic components,â€? as well as finished goods, imports and exports. While the tariffs had only a â€œlimited impactâ€? in the second quarter, he warned in an earnings call with analysts that there could be further effects in the future as suppliers are forced to pay the tariffs.A Goldman Sachs report released last week on the potential effect of tariffs on earnings and returns from the S&P 500 found that industries that are heavily reliant on imports, such as petroleum and coal products, computer and electronic products, and transportation face the â€œgreatest supply chain riskâ€? from escalating trade tensions.While tariffs could lower revenues, the report found that the duties posed a larger threat to profit margins of the S&P 500.On Wednesday, UPS Chief Executive David Abney said the company has â€œseen no significant impact at this timeâ€? to the companyâ€™s international freight shipment business, though it is â€œclosely monitoringâ€? the trade environment.â€œIf this trade war continued or these actions continued, there would always be some exposure or risk to our business,â€? he said. â€œBut that exposure is very much limited.â€?Boeing Co., a huge user of aluminum in its airplanes, did not mention tariffs in its earnings call Wednesday. A company executive did note, though, that good trade relations between the United States and China â€” which have been levying duties against each otherâ€™s products tit-for-tat â€” were beneficial to the aerospace industry.Â© 2018 All rights reserved.

"In announcing sweeping new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, President Donald Trump last week tweeted that â€œtrade wars are good, and easy to win.â€? But who wins a trade war?The lesson of history is clear: Trade wars have no winners. And they are certainly not good. They tend to damage the economies of all countries involved, raising tensions and increasing the risk of international conflict.The last full-blown global trade war was sparked by the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930. As the U.S. slid into the Great Depression, two members of Congress introduced a bill whose goal was to protect struggling American farmers by raising tariffs on agricultural imports. As the bill moved through Congress, the limited farm protection bill snowballed into a protectionist behemoth, raising nearly 900 tariff lines covering 20,000 agricultural and manufactured products. Over the objections of economists, trade advisors, and foreign governments, President Herbert Hoover signed the bill into law.The reaction from around the world was swift and punitive. Canada, Americaâ€™s leading trade partner at the time, imposed retaliatory tariffs that cut U.S. exports to Canada by half. Several other European countries enacted protectionist policies in retaliation to the new U.S. tariff. A trade war had begun.Who won this war? As the tragedy of the interwar period makes clear, everyone lost. In the U.S., the Great Depression worsened, and economists agree that trade protection not only deepened the countryâ€™s economic collapse but prolonged it. Global trade almost completely collapsed and the tariff was likely responsible for about half of the free fall. U.S. exports fell by about 40% over the course of the next year, crushing American industries. U.S. imports fell by nearly the same amount, devastating the economies of our trading partners. These dire economic straits around the world increased antagonisms between countries, led to nationalist economic policies designed to impoverish other nations, facilitated the rise of fascist strongmen promising to restore economic growth by any means necessary, and contributed to the outbreak of World War II.When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, donâ€™t trade anymore-we win big. Itâ€™s easy! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2018The steep tariffs Trump proposed last week are designed to protect a very specific and small set of constituents: owners and workers in the steel and aluminum industries. Trump argues that protecting domestic metals production is a matter of national security. While this may be true for rarer metals, it is tough to make this argument in regards to aluminum and steel, which are plentiful in supply. And if the U.S. invokes the national security argument to get out of World Trade Organization rules on tariffsâ€”rules we led the way in creatingâ€”whatâ€™s to stop the rest of the world from doing the same thing?It is imperative that our policymakers find ways to compensate Americans whose jobs are threatened by global economic integration. But that is best done through generous social welfare policies and support in making the transition to new employment. Raising tariffs is an economically irrational way to protect workers from foreign competition.The reason for this is that tariffs that protect one industry make the rest of the economy worse off. Tariffs raise the cost of imports, and retaliatory tariffs (which some of our most important trading partners have already threatened) make it more difficult to export. Americaâ€™s globally competitive firms in a range of industries will be doubly damaged: The price they pay for imported steel and aluminum products will rise while retaliatory tariffs make it more difficult for them to export. If our firms become less competitive, they will hire fewer workers or layoff existing workers, or both, and the costs of goods for American consumers will go up as well. The new tariffs will make cars, appliances, and anything else that uses steel and aluminum more expensive.Coils of steel on trains in front of the ThyssenKrupp steel mill in Duisburg, Germany. Trump's tariffs have raised fears of a trade war. Lukas Schulze/Getty ImagesIs a trade war â€œeasy to winâ€?? Far from it. A trade war today would be much more damaging for the U.S. than the trade war of the 1930s, as exports today account for a greater proportion of U.S. gross domestic product than they did on the eve of Smoot-Hawley. If our trading partners retaliate as they have threatened (the European Union says it will target blue jeans, orange juice, Kentucky bourbon, and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, among other products) American producers stand to lose billions in export revenues and thousands of Americans could lose their jobs.At the international level, history teaches us another thing: The more countries trade with each other, the less likely they are to end up at war. In the face of rising nationalism and authoritarianism worldwide, it is in Americaâ€™s best interest to maintain the rules-based free trade system that creates a powerful incentive for peace.Mary Anne Madeira is an assistant professor of political science at Queens College, City University of New York.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trump is headed for a showdown with Americaâ€™s allies at a Group of Seven summit this week in Quebec, with the European Union and Canada threatening retaliatory measures unless he reverses course on new steel and aluminum levies.China, meanwhile, is warning it will withdraw commitments it made on trade if the president carries out a separate threat to impose tariffs on the Asian country. While China doesnâ€™t want an escalation in trade tensions, it has the confidence, competence and experience to defend its core interests, according to a commentary published Monday by state-run Economic Daily.Trump changes his mind often enough that U.S. allies and rivals alike hope heâ€™ll do just that on tariffs in the next few days. An all-out trade war may become unavoidable if he doesnâ€™t.â€œWe still have a few days to avoid an escalation. We still have a few days to take the necessary steps to avoid a trade war between the EU and the U.S.,â€? French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said after a meeting of G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors in Whistler, British Columbia.The White House appeared unfazed by threats from allies. Top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was â€œoverreactingâ€? in response to the tariffs, and said the blame for any escalation lies with the U.S.â€™s trading partners. He said Trump is simply responding to decades of trade abuse.â€œDonâ€™t blame Trump,â€? Kudlow said on â€œFox News Sunday.â€? â€œBlame China, blame Europe, blame NAFTA, blame those who donâ€™t want reciprocal trading, tariff rates and protectionism.â€?The metal tariffs imposed on the European Union and Canada are the latest escalation by the U.S. on the trade front that has roiled financial markets for months and prompted the International Monetary Fund to warn of a trade war that could undermine the broadest global upswing in years.Unanimous CondemnationFinance chiefs from the group of wealthy nations emerged from three days of talks on Saturday â€œunanimousâ€? in their condemnation of Trumpâ€™s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, promising to press ahead with retaliatory measures unless Trump steps back.It was a rare rebuke of a member nation by the group that foreshadows high drama when Trump meets leaders of the other six major industrialized nations Friday at a summit in the Quebec resort town of Charlevoix, near the border with Maine.Stupid TradeTrump, for his part, spent time during his weekend retreat at Camp David tweeting that â€œstupid tradeâ€? could â€œno longer be tolerated. The president said the tariffs being charged against other countries would help to fund the U.S. government, and repeated his refrain that the U.S. could not lose a trade war in a international climate where the rules were already stacked against American business. He specifically noted the size of the trade deficit with China as he defended his moves.â€œThe U.S. has been ripped off by other countries for years on Trade, time to get smart!â€? Trump tweeted Saturday.While both the U.S. and China reported some progress in discussions this weekend about how to reduce Chinaâ€™s $375 billion goods-trade surplus with the U.S., Trumpâ€™s revival last week of a plan to slap tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports has cast the talks into turmoil.â€œIf the U.S. rolls out trade measures including tariffs, all the agreements reached in the negotiations wonâ€™t take effect,â€? state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday, citing a statement from the Chinese team that met with a U.S. delegation led by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.Franceâ€™s Le Maire opened the door to negotiations over U.S. tariffs, but said the ball is in Trumpâ€™s court. â€œWe want to avoid a trade war,â€? he said. â€œBut everything is ready.â€?The warning came after an acrimonious three days of talks â€” with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on the receiving end of much of the frustration â€” in which Americaâ€™s allies protested against Trumpâ€™s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from the European Union, Canada and Mexico.Undermines ConfidenceThe trade dispute triggered one of the biggest crises in the G-7 since the groupâ€™s formation by Canada, France, Italy, Germany, the U.K., Japan and the U.S. In a rare rebuke of a member nation, G-7 finance chiefs said the U.S. duties could â€œundermine open trade and confidence in the global economy.â€?Tense G-7â€œIt has been a tense and tough G-7. I would say it has been far more a G-6 plus one than a G-7,â€? said Le Maire. The EU has threatened to retaliate with duties on everything from American motorcycles to bourbon. Canada and Mexico have also promised to levy their own tariffs on U.S. goods.Before last weekâ€™s trade actions by the U.S., the European Union and Canada had been granted temporary exemptions. Japan had already been subject to the tariffs, which the U.S. said were necessary to protect its national security.At his closing press conference, Mnuchin said that heâ€™s already conveyed the G-7 message to Trump, who he said â€œhas been very clear in wanting to address trade issues.â€?Mnuchin rejected the notion the U.S. is abandoning its traditional leadership role in the world economy, noting that America is driving global growth. While acknowledging the U.S. tariffs are causing friction, he said the members of the group agree on many other issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The tit-for-tat has begunâ€”and itâ€™s not just between the U.S. and China.After President Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European carsâ€”a decision he is due to make in the coming weeksâ€”the European Union is preparing to hit back.The duties on Harley-Davidson (hog) motorcycles, peanut butter, and bourbon imposed in late June were just a start; now The Financial Times reports that the EU now has its eyes on â€œhumble staples such as ketchup.â€?But your favorite french fry condiment isnâ€™t the only target. The retaliation list reportedly includes duties worth over 18 billion euro ($21.07 billion), on items such as frozen fish, raisins, suitcases, and adhesive bandages.These tariffs will only be implemented should Trump decide to go ahead with placing duties on EU cars and car parts. Europe imported American cars worth â‚¬77 billion ($90.13 billion) in 2016, while the U.S. imported â‚¬254 billion ($296.12) in cars from Europe, according to Eurostat figures reported by CNBC. That large trade deficit is a major reason behind Trumpâ€™s proposal to impose new duties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is the web version of Data Sheet, Fortuneâ€™s daily newsletter on the top tech news. To get it delivered daily to your in-box, sign up here.The U.S.-China trade war has rekindled the old debate about whether China is capable of genuine technological innovation. This time around, though, some of the most strident skeptics of Chinaâ€™s achievements are Chinese.An early sign of the turnabout came in April, after the Trump administration slapped a ban on U.S. sales to ZTE, Chinaâ€™s second-largest telecommunications manufacturer. To many in China, the ban was a kind of â€œSputnik momentâ€? because it revealed that one of Chinaâ€™s proudest tech leaders was almost entirely dependent on American microchips.In the wake of the ZTE ban, President Xi urged the nation to â€œabandon illusions and rely on ourselvesâ€? for breakthroughs in science and tech. But it was unclear which â€œillusionsâ€? he meant. Was he reproaching those who imagined that China no longer needs foreign technology? Or was he just warning that China could no longer count on buying that technology from overseas?Xi himself has drawn criticism for Chinaâ€™s technological failures in recent weeks following an viral post on WeChat that stoked public anxieties about a vaccine recall by one of Chinaâ€™s largest drug companies. The post alleged deliberate falsification of health data by a web of unscrupulous executives, scientists and regulators. The government launched a high-profile investigationâ€”and clamped down on online discussion. But the incident sparked nationwide outrage that, for all Chinaâ€™s vaunted advances in science, its citizens live in constant fear of fake vaccines, fake baby formula, toxic food, and foul air and water.Such outrage helped fuel a vehement attack in social media this month against Hu Angang, director of the center for China Studies at prestigious Tsinghua University and author of China in 2020: A New Type of Superpower. Huâ€™s critics have denounced him as a â€œtriumphalistâ€? who exaggerates the nationâ€™s economic and technological prowess. Meanwhile, Jack Maâ€™s South China Morning Post this week published an essay by Zhang Jun, dean of the school of economics in Fudan University, arguing that in sectors like semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and automobile manufacturing, China is â€œnowhere near the technological frontier,â€? and more than 20 years behind South Korea and Japan when it comes to getting results from investments in research and development.Not everyone has been swept up in the triumphalist backlash. Baidu CEO Robin Li took a moment to taunt Google on his social media account following reports that the U.S. search giant is eying a return to China. Baidu was already trouncing Google in 2010, Li noted, and will be even harder to beat now. Weâ€™ll â€œwin again,â€? he crowed.

"Blue Ridge Home Fashionsâ€™ problem is feathers. For Empire Today, itâ€™s vinyl planks. At Jammy, thereâ€™s a whole bunch of things, from tail lights to reflective tape.All three companies are on the losing end of President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade war with China. Their supply chains have been disrupted, their planning and forecasting thrown into chaos. The whole experience has been, in the words of Jammy Chief Executive Officer Ralph Bradley, a â€œreal kick in the ass.â€?The next blow could come this week, with tariffs of as much as 25% hitting $200 billion in goods, including materials and parts these businesses buy in bulk. The Trump administration has avoided putting duties on finished products, like smartphones and sneakers, for fear of a consumer backlash at home as it aims to punish China. But as it turns out, the president who vowed to boost U.S. manufacturing is hammering some of the companies that managed to survive globalization and thrive.Since Trump kicked off trade disputes with a big chunk of the world, these companies have been navigating to limit the financial pain â€” and traverse the confusion. One day, a deal with Beijing seemed possible; the next, the president would vow to slap levies on everything the Asian nation sells to the U.S.â€œTheyâ€™ve thrown so many unknowns into it that itâ€™s made it challenging to make any long-term strategic decisions,â€? Bradley said. â€œItâ€™s a reason for loss of sleep.â€?The first round of import duties on China hit $34 billion in products in July, the next on $16 billion worth in August. The $200 billion question has been hovering for weeks. Itâ€™s all made for â€œa lot of volatility here in tariff world,â€? said Carol Tome, chief financial officer of Home Depot.The smaller the enterprise, of course, the more difficult the challenge. They donâ€™t have the economies of scale, the back-office staff, the lobbying forces or the deep pockets to roll with the punches as a Home Depot-size company can do.Jammy, an auto-parts importer Bradleyâ€™s dad started almost half a century ago in Forth Worth, Texas, has 11 employees and recorded $12 million in revenue last year. It embraced globalization in the â€™80s, forging a joint venture with a factory in Shaoxing, in eastern China, that makes the injection-molded plastic and bent tubular steel Jammy needs to fashion tail lights and other parts for everything from giant lawnmowers to combines made in the U.S.â€œItâ€™s impossible for a company like mine to just change their manufacturing location,â€? said Bradley, 39, who estimated Jammy has put $5 million into the Shaoxing plant. â€œI have too much invested over there.â€?The tariffs that went into effect on Aug. 23 included reflective tape â€” the kind that goes on the sides of tractor trailers â€” so Bradley paid $7,500 to air-freight 1,700 rolls a few days before. That was about ten times the cost of shipping by boat, but he had orders to fill.And he spent so much of the summer scrambling, talking to customers and his sales team about how to steer Jammy through the trade war, that he let other projects slide. Heâ€™d been planning to hire two people in logistics and marketing but hasnâ€™t found time to even write the job descriptions; installing a new computer system was put on hold.If the latest round of tariffs proposed by Trump is implemented, parts in fully 85% of the products Jammy sells will suddenly be as much as 25% more expensive. Passing that on would share the pain with customers including Bain Capitalâ€™s American Trailer Works Inc., which makes utility and cargo trailers.At Blue Ridge, based in Irwindale, California, thereâ€™s a different level of stress-out. The companyâ€™s second factory just opened in an old steel plant in Allentown, Pennsylvania, thatâ€™s big enough to add more sewing machines. The Trump tax overhaul reduced corporate tax rates for this year and gave CEO Ning He the capital to expand with the new facility, at a cost of more than $1 million.Then Trump put feathers on his $200 billion tariff list. China is by far the biggest producer of fluffy down plucked from geese and ducks, the kind Blue Ridge stuffs into about 70% of the pillows and duvets it makes for retailers including Macyâ€™s and Costco Wholesale. There isnâ€™t a lot of wiggle room for the company, which employs around 100 people and has had about $100 million in sales over the past three years.â€œIâ€™m in big trouble,â€? said Ning, 55, who became a U.S. citizen after immigrating from China three decades ago.The way Trump is waging this trade war doesnâ€™t make sense to him. â€œMy first reaction was this is stupid. If they are doing this smart, I have no complaint. The decision looks like it was made by someone doesnâ€™t understand the industry. Maybe they donâ€™t know down feather comes from duck and goose. Maybe they think it comes from chicken?â€?Blue Ridgeâ€™s retail accounts want current prices locked in for next year â€” and they can easily switch to one of his big Chinese competitors, whose finished products arenâ€™t under any tariff threat. Thatâ€™s why Ning is considering moving his own production lines to that country. In the meantime, heâ€™s rushing to import as many feathers as he can and hoping for a resolution between the White House and Beijing.â€œEveryone is very panicked,â€? Ning said. â€œI hope they can reach a deal.â€?Keith Weinberger, CEO of Empire Today, wasnâ€™t terribly worried in the beginning. He thought he had everything under control as he finalized a presentation on July 30 for the board on dealing with tariffs of 10% on the luxury vinyl planks the home-flooring and carpet installer imports from China. Empireâ€™s suppliers there had agreed to eat the cost for a while in exchange for a certain level of committed orders. Empire, with $700 million in annual sales, has the wherewithal to provide that.But two days later, Weinbergerâ€™s plans were torched when Trump ordered his administration to consider pushing the duties to 25%. The company, based in Northlake, Illinois, sources all its carpet and a lot of its other flooring in the U.S., but this kind from China â€” what the industry calls LVP â€” is the fastest-growing part of its business. Thereâ€™s some production in America, but not nearly enough to meet demand.â€œItâ€™s not what I want to be spending my time on, but Iâ€™m worried about the impact this is going to have,â€? said Weinberger, 46, who started his career at Procter & Gamble.So Empire recently hired a lobbying firm to help out in Washington. â€œWeâ€™re hoping for an exemption â€” weâ€™re just trying to do anything we can think of.â€?On Thursday, he and the others may have a clearer picture of the future. Thatâ€™s when the public-comment period on the proposed tariffs closes and, according to people familiar with the matter, Trump wants to move ahead with his plan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The fallout has been quick. China, the world?s largest importer of soybeans, has scaled back purchases of U.S. grain to feed its massive hog herd.It is turning instead to Brazil, which has ridden the wave of Chinese demand for two decades to become a global agricultural powerhouse. Brazilian soybean exports to the Asian country jumped 22 percent by value between January and September, compared to the same period a year ago.Brazilian producers are not only selling more grain, their soy is fetching $2.83 more per bushel than beans from the United States, up from a premium of just $0.60 a year ago, thanks to stepped up Chinese purchases.Prices for U.S. soybeans, meanwhile, recently sunk to decade lows that farmers say are below the cost of production. The slump has made the agricultural sector a drag on an otherwise healthy U.S. economy. The Trump administration said in July it would spend up to $12 billion in taxpayer funds to help U.S. farmers offset trade-related losses, although the aid package could shrink.Many American farmers, overwhelmingly conservative voters who helped propel Donald Trump to the presidency, are standing by their man. They believe he will eventually negotiate a better trade deal with China, whose appetite for soybeans is so vast that it cannot completely wean itself off U.S. grain.But for the time being, Trump trade policies are handing precious market share, money and momentum to Brazil, the United States? most formidable agricultural competitor.

But with a trade war upending the outlook for the global container shipping industry, investors are reviewing their options.Short interest in Maersk has jumped to about 6 percent of the share capital this year, according to data compiled by IHS Markit. Thatâ€™s the highest level on record, with the data going back until 2006 (the numbers have been adjusted for the effect of dividend payments).The global economy is now firmly in the grip of an escalating trade war. On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said heâ€™s â€œready to goâ€? with new tariffs on $500 billion of Chinese goods destined for the U.S., which roughly corresponds to the value of all imports from China to America.For a company that controls about a fifth of the worldâ€™s container fleet, which transports goods worth $4 trillion a year, the new wave of protectionism could be devastating. Maersk has already lost more than 20 percent of its market value this year as investors try to digest the changing landscape.â€œThereâ€™s a lot of uncertainty over how container freight demand will develop during the remainder of the year, caused by the tariffs implemented on Chinese imports in the U.S,â€? David Kerstens, an analyst at Jefferies, said by phone. â€œClearly thereâ€™s a risk the situation escalates and further impacts Transpacific trade flows.â€?Maersk, which like other shipping companies is still trying to cope with the overcapacity that has weighed on the industry for the past decade, has been a vocal critic of Trumpâ€™s attack on free trade.Maerskâ€™s main shipping route is between Asia and Europe, with less exposure to direct trade between China and the U.S. So the fallout of a trade war between those two countries on its business has been limited, to date.Worldâ€™s Biggest Shipping Firm Battered by Escalating Trade WarBut that may change â€œif the situation further escalates and affects other routes, including Transatlantic trade,â€? Kerstens said.AQR Capital Management is among funds now betting against Maersk. A July 18 regulatory filing showed the firm has a short position equal to 0.5 percent of Maerskâ€™s share capital (the Danish regulator doesnâ€™t identify funds with positions smaller than that). Greenwich, Connecticut-based AQR declined to comment, when contacted by phone.â€œThe fallout from tariffs on container shipping is likely to be pronounced,â€? Rahul Kapoor, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said. â€œWe believe the best of trade growth is already behind and carriers will have to cut capacity at a rapid pace in order to arrest freight-rate declines if they have any chance of third-quarter profitability.â€?Maersk shares continued their slide on Monday, declining as much as 3.1 percent in Copenhagen.Meanwhile, Maersk is in the second year of an historic transformation with the aim of having a business that focuses on transport and has no energy assets. But the market â€œdoesnâ€™t attribute much value to the transformation at the momentâ€? as the stock is â€œvery much a macro play,â€? according to Kerstens.At the same time, thereâ€™s concern that Maersk may struggle to achieve its full-year forecast for Ebitda, of $4 billion to $5 billion, due to rising costs. The average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 12 analysts suggests Maersk will only reach $3.68 billion this year. Just four weeks ago, the average estimate pointed to an Ebitda of $4.16 billion.â€œFuel costs are up more than 20 percent year-to-date, negatively impacting profitability, as freight rates are 4 percent lower year-to-date,â€? Kerstens said. On the plus side, there are signs that container-fleet overcapacity is easing as fewer new ships come to market, he said. â€œThat is the argument for the bull case,â€? he said.Maersk, which publishes second-quarter results on Aug. 17, declined to comment. Back in May the company said â€œincreased uncertainties due to geopolitical risks, trade tensions and other factors,â€? may affect its ability to deliver on its full-year guidance.Â© 2018 Bloomberg L.P",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How China can avoid a trade war with the USBeijing must recognise the shift in American perceptions and make some concessionsMartin WolfHow should China respond to Donald Trumpâ€™s aggressive trade policy? The answer is: strategically. It needs to manage a rising tide of US hostility.Of the events in Washington last week, the appointment of John Bolton as the US presidentâ€™s principal adviser on national security may well be more momentous than the announcement of a â€œsection 301â€? trade action against China. Nevertheless, the plan to impose 25 per cent tariffs on $60bn of (as yet, unspecified) Chinese exports to the US shows the aggression of Mr Trumpâ€™s trade agenda. The proposed tariffs are just one of several actions aimed at Chinaâ€™s technology-related policies. These include a case against China at the World Trade Organization and a plan to impose new restrictions on its investments in US technology companies.The objectives of these US actions are unclear. Is it merely to halt alleged misbehaviour, such as forced transfers â€” or outright theft â€” of intellectual property? Or, as the labelling of China as a â€œstrategic competitorâ€? suggests, is it to halt Chinaâ€™s technological progress altogether â€” an aim that is unachievable and certainly non-negotiable.Mr Trump also emphasised the need for China to slash its US bilateral trade surplus by $100bn. Indeed, his rhetoric implies that trade should balance with each partner. This aim is, once again, neither achievable nor negotiable.The optimistic view is that these are opening moves in a negotiation that will end in a deal. A more pessimistic perspective is that this is a stage in an endless process of fraught negotiations between the two superpowers far into the future. A still more pessimistic view is that trade discussions will break down in a cycle of retaliation, perhaps as part of broader hostilities.Which it turns out to be also depends on China. It must recognise the shift in US perceptions, of which Mr Trumpâ€™s election is a symptom. Moreover, on trade, the Democrats are far more protectionist than the Republicans.What are the forces driving this shift? Chinaâ€™s rise has made the US fear the loss of its primacy. Chinaâ€™s communist autocracy is ideologically at odds with US democracy. What economists call â€œthe China shockâ€? has been real and significant, although trade with China has not been the main reason for the adverse changes experienced by US industrial workers. The US has also failed to provide the safety net or active support needed by affected workers and communities.Furthermore, the deal reached when China joined the WTO in 2001 is no longer acceptable. As Mr Trump states, the US wants strict â€œreciprocityâ€?. Finally, many business people argue that China is â€œcheatingâ€?, in pursuit of its industrial objectives.Experience shows that the complaints will never end. A decade or so ago, complaints were about Chinaâ€™s current account surpluses, undervalued exchange rate and huge accumulations of reserves. All these have now been transformed: the current account surplus itself has fallen to just 1.4 per cent of gross domestic product. Now complaints have shifted towards bilateral imbalances, forced transfers of technology, excess capacity and Chinaâ€™s foreign direct investment. China is successful, big and different. Complaints change, but not the complaining.How might China manage these frictions, exacerbated by the character of Mr Trump, yet rooted in deep anxieties?First, retaliate with targeted, precise and limited countermeasures. Like all bullies, Mr Trump respects strength. Indeed, he respects Chinaâ€™s Xi Jinping.Second, defuse legitimate complaints or ones whose redress is in Chinaâ€™s interests. Liberalising the Chinese economy is in Chinaâ€™s own interests, as the astonishing results of 40 years of â€œreform and opening upâ€? demonstrate. China can and should accelerate its own domestic and external liberalisation. Among the widely shared complaints of foreign businesses, is over pressure to transfer know-how as part of doing business in China. Such â€œperformance requirementsâ€? are contrary to WTO rules. China needs to act decisively on this.Third, make some concessions. China could import liquefied natural gas from the US. This would reduce the bilateral surplus, while merely reallocating gas supplies across the world. But doing the same thing for commodities in which China is the worldâ€™s dominant market would be far more problematic, since it would hurt other suppliers. Mr Trump may well want China to discriminate against Australian foodstuffs or European aircraft. That way lies the end of the liberal global trading system.Fourth, multilateralise these discussions. The issue of surpluses in standard products like steel cannot be dealt with at a purely unilateral or bilateral level. As a rising global power, China could play a central role in trade liberalisation, thereby strengthening the system and increasing the worldâ€™s stake in the health of the Chinese economy. Operating at such a global level brings another potential benefit: it is hard for great powers to negotiate bilaterally, since they tend to view concessions to each other as humiliating.In the global context, however, a concession can be seen as a benefit to everybody. Finally, by operating under the rubric of the WTO, China puts Europeans in a difficult position. Europeans share US anxieties over Chinaâ€™s policies on intellectual property, but they also believe in the rules. If China took the high road, Europeans might feel compelled to support it.We are in a new era of strategic competition. The question is whether this will be managed or lead to a breakdown in relations. Mr Trumpâ€™s trade policy is a highly destabilising part of this story. China should take the longer view of it, for its own sake and that of the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a highly controversial move, US President Donald Trump decided to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US. The move, likely to invite retaliatory measures from other countries, raising the spectre of a trade war, dominated the headlines this week.The Washington Post wrote a trenchant editorial noting that Trumpâ€™s tariffs will hurt all Americans. â€œPrices on everything made from steel and aluminium will go up; jobs saved by producers may be offset by jobs lost elsewhere. If that seems contradictory, consider the fact that this tax increase on raw materials comes from the same president who says the economy is booming because he cut taxes on income. Trumpâ€™s words are not always an exact guide to the policies his administration formally adopts. Already, though, the president and his commerce secretary have legitimised unilateral invocation of a â€˜national securityâ€™ exception to normal trade rules. Other countries can play that game, too; and more might try, now that the United States has set this bad example. Race to the bottom, trade war: Call it what you will, the spiral will eventually harm everyone, the US and its metal industries very much included.â€?The Wall Street Journal editorialised that the tax increase will punish American workers. â€œDonald Trump made the biggest policy blunder of his Presidency by announcing that next week heâ€™ll impose tariffs of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminium. This tax increase will punish American workers, invite retaliation that will harm US exports, divide his political coalition at home, anger allies abroad, and undermine his tax and regulatory reforms,â€? the paper concluded.No one should underestimate the escalation of global trade tension that will result from Trumpâ€™s decision to impose steel tariffs on national security grounds, wrote the Financial Times. The paper added, â€œTrade wars are good and easy to win,â€? the president tweeted, threatening a few hours later to add further unspecified taxes on imports at the US border. Before such serious consequences become apparent at the WTO, the US presidentâ€™s move is almost certain to provoke retaliation and the threat of an escalation into a full trade conflict. The US administration said that 2018 would be the year it brought trade troops to the ramparts. We hoped this was a bluff, but now know the US assault brigade are carrying heavy offensive weapons. The president is playing with fire and the casualties will be felt at home as much as abroad, paper underlined.The New York Times called trade wars destructive. â€œItâ€™s also not clear that these tariffs will help Trump achieve his goal of increasing manufacturing employment in the United States. For example, businesses located in this country already produce about 70 per cent of the steel used here. Experts say for every new job at a steel mill or aluminium smelter that is created by this trade decision, the country could lose as many or more jobs at businesses that use those metals, which will now cost more. This is one of the reasons that trade wars are, in fact, not easy to win,â€? the paper wrote. Trump clearly sees trade as a zero-sum game. He and some of his most protectionist advisers, including Peter Navarro, think that if China and Mexico sell the US more things than they import from America, they are winning, The New York Times cautioned, adding, â€œThe president wants to turn the table on them with tariffs and other trade restrictions. But trade is much more complicated than that. Tariffs are blunt instruments that can hurt countries that use them, just as much as they can help. The steel and aluminium tariffs might, on their own, have only a small impact on the economy. But the greater fear many experts have is that Trump is just getting started and will impose new tariffs on a host of other imports, sending the US into a much broader trade war, the likes of which the world hasnâ€™t seen since the Great Depression. That would have a large and devastating economic impact, in the US and around the globe.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Two of the nationâ€™s most influential players in agriculture policy, at a meeting in the heart of the countryâ€™s Grain Belt on Wednesday, tried to ease worries about the pending farm bill and a budding trade war with China.In a meeting outside Manhattan, Kansas, Republican and U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts said a bipartisan farm bill looks within reach by the middle of June.Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Kansas U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran joined him in an old stone barn for the farm meeting, where they defended a tough trade stance and said dueling tariffs arenâ€™t inevitable.Meantime, lawmakers in Washington are squabbling over how to craft a farm bill. Roberts said a proposal in the U.S. House, which carries stricter work requirements for recipients of federal food aid, canâ€™t pass the Senate.â€œItâ€™s a pretty good bill and I hope they pass it, but I canâ€™t do that,â€? he told reporters after the meeting. â€œWe can do some good things in the farm bill with regard to SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrional Assistance Program) without doing any damage to the program.â€?Negotiations over the farm bill â€” about 80 percent of it is SNAP; other major things include commodity supports and conservation efforts â€” often are a slog. The 2013 bill took an extra year to pass.The current farm bill expires Sept. 30. The U.S. House already voted down the measure when the conservative Freedom Caucus insisted this month a vote on immigration come first, while Democrats opposed the SNAP work-requirement changes.Kansas Rep. Roger Marshall told High Plains Public Radio last week that the House doesnâ€™t plan to change anything in the bill before bringing it back to the floor June 22. The Senate has yet to offer its version of the farm bill, though a North Dakota senator has said theyâ€™ll start working on the bill in committee next week.Roberts said that details of the bill hadnâ€™t been finalized, but Senate leaders had agreed to allow a path forward for the legislation. He said New York's Chuck Schumer, the leader of Senate Democrats, promised not to use a parliamentary rule known as cloture to jam up the process.â€œThatâ€™s amazing,â€? Roberts said. â€œThis is a time when if a jackrabbit hopped across the floor of United States Senate, Chuck Schumer would either shoot it or file cloture on it.â€?Roberts, Moran and Perdue said they had stressed to President Donald Trump the importance of international markets to agricultural and manufactured goods exported from Kansas.Perdue said farmers have had legitimate anxiety after a â€œroller coasterâ€? of trade negotiations with China.Reworking the North American Free Trade Agreement has been in the works for months. Trade became a significant issue for farmers in late March and early April, when the Trump administration proposed an escalating series of tariffs on Chinese goods. China responded in kind. China said it would target pork, beef, fruit, nuts and sorghum. Sorghum is becoming a major crop in Great Plains states such as Kansas.Perdue said farmers should stay cool during the ups and downs as the administration works on boosting U.S. exports to China.â€œPresident Trump ... has a unique and very effective negotiating style,â€? Perdue said. â€œAt the end of the day, farmers are going to be very happy over the trade additions that we see in China.â€?Moran said he and others have been trying to persuade Trump to try strategies beyond a trade war, such as forming other international trade partnerships that can then collectively put pressure on China.â€œYes, China is a problem,â€? Moran said. â€œThey cheat, they misbehave. They donâ€™t follow the rules, but the solution is not a broad tariff battle.â€?Moran said heâ€™s told the president that industries including agriculture need international trade markets such as China.â€œI hope this is a negotiating tactic that works,â€? Moran said, â€œbut the risks are tremendous if we donâ€™t get it right.â€?Due to an editing error, this story originally identified Chuck Schumer as representing the wrong state.Stephen Koranda is Statehouse reporter for Kansas Public Radio, a partner in the Kansas News Service.

"Texas Lt. Gov.: Keep National Guard at the Border 'Until Hell Freezes Over'President Trump said Friday he understands that there will be short-term pain from his China tariffs, but said he is more concerned with long-term strength.Speaking on New York's WABC radio, Trump defended his decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, along with other Chinese goods.'I'm not saying there wonâ€™t be a little pain. So we may take a hit, and you know what, ultimately we're going to be much stronger for it, but it's something we ought to do,' said Trump.China responded with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products and vowed to 'immediately fight back with force and without hesitation.'The stock market continues to react negatively to the perceived trade war, though Trump has said any trade war with China was lost long ago by his White House predecessors.China, which is a great economic power, is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization.

"Update: On June 15, Lucerne International CEO Mary Buchzeiger said she had been notified that the auto door hinges manufactured by her company had been removed from the Trump administration's list of goods that would be subject to a 25 percent tariff.The last time Mary Buchzeiger was in Washington, D.C., she was a 13-year-old on an eighth-grade trip.This week, as the head of a small company that supplies parts to automakers, she joined other business leaders in the nation's capital to talk about President Trump's proposed tariffs aimed at China.'I'm not a political person,' she says as sips coffee in a cafe a couple of blocks from the U.S. Capitol. But she says she fears the tariffs could destroy her company.During hearings before trade officials, leaders of U.S. companies, large and small, voiced both concern and support for the president's strategy. Buchzeiger pleaded her case, hoping to save her company.She owns and runs a business founded by her father, Lucerne International in Auburn Hills, Mich. It's a small-parts supplier. But it's a big supplier to Chrysler's Jeep brand.Lucerne International provides all the hinges for the Jeep Wrangler. 'They're all class A forgings,' she says proudly. 'Our company is actually one of the only ones in the world that can produce class A forgings,' which are parts visible on a vehicle's exterior.'It's polished jewelry on the outside of a vehicle,' she says, 'It can't have defects in it; nicks, scratches, dents, dings, anything like that. ... It's gotta look pretty.' Check out the door hinges on the next Jeep Wrangler you see. They came from Buchzeiger's company.Those hinges and about 90 percent of the parts Lucerne International supplies to U.S. automakers would be hit by a 25 percent tax under Trump's tariffs. The tariffs are supposed to protect U.S. businesses, but Buchzeiger doesn't see it that way.'They're attacks on U.S. companies that are using Chinese goods,' she says.And that's the rub. Buchzeiger's company produces most of its parts in China. 'I would love to be able to manufacture these parts in the U.S.,' she says.She says she's tried several times to find American factories to fill her orders. But she hasn't found 'one company that can handle even half the volume of one part' Lucerne International produces.'There's no capacity left for manufacturing here,' she says. Currently, Buchzeiger is investigating the possibility of putting a plant in Flint, Mich., where she was born. But if the tariffs hit now, she fears she'll be out of business before that could even happen.A couple hours after the conversation over coffee, Buchzeiger sat down in a stuffy and crowded government hearing room to tell her story. She had five minutes to make the case for an exemption before a panel of trade officials.She read forcefully from a prepared statement: 'The tariffs proposed by President Trump would cripple my business and many like it in the Midwest,' Buchzeiger told the panel of trade bureaucrats. 'I'm fighting for the life of my company and for the livelihood of my employees. And I'm fighting to protect an intricate auto supply chain that creates hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs.'Buchzeiger answered some brief questions from the trade panel, and waited while other business people made their cases, for and against the tariffs.'I think it went well,' she said as she left the hearing. 'I got the message across and it was exactly what I expected. I'm hopeful that they heard our message.'Buchzeiger is a Republican. She says she hopes Trump will get the message that his tariffs could harm many businesses and workers in the upper Midwest â€” 'Trump country.'If or when those tariffs take effect remains unclear.

"Below are some of the currencies, stocks and commodities seen most vulnerable to an escalating trade conflict:CurrenciesCountries with open economies reliant on global trade are most at risk when disputes over international commerce hit.The Australian dollar ticks those boxes. Australia counts China as its biggest trading partner and its currency is heavily correlated to global growth. Many investors see the currency, known as the Aussie, as a better global trade bellwether than the Canadian dollar, which has been buffeted by negotiations over Nafta, the North American trade pact.This week, the Aussie fell to its lowest level in 13 months, and the positioning of options signal more weakness ahead.Another candidate is Sweden's crown, given the Nordic nation's open economy and big exporting industries. The currency has weakened about 2.5 percent in the last three days to a six-week low against the euro.'Currencies which are heavily exposed to global growth are going to feel the pressure from any escalation in the trade dispute,' said James Binny, global head of currency at State Street Global Advisors, based in London.Asian currencies such as the Korean won as well as the Singapore and Hong Kong dollars have also weakened this week for similar reasons.EquitiesBank of America Merrill Lynch's European fund manager survey in June found a record drop in allocations to auto stocks, indicating that investors are jittery about the sector due to Trump's threat of imposing US tariffs on German carmakers.European automakers send around $50 billion worth of cars to the United States each year. BMW is the most exposed with up to one fifth of its global sales heading to the US market.Retaliatory Chinese tariffs on US cars would also hurt European firms as many export to China from their US plants.As a result, shares in Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler have fallen sharply, taking Europe's autos index to a seven-month low.The aircraft industry, including Boeing and Airbus , is another barometer as it relies heavily on an open global supply chain.Boeing is the single largest US exporter to China, and its shares, along with those of its European counterpart, have fluctuated as trade tensions have risen.Steel and aluminum are regular targets in international trade disputes. US tariffs on imported steel have hit shares in European steelmaking exporters such as Thyssenkrupp, Salzgitter and Voestalpine.Europe-based manufacturers that import steel for US factories may also become entangled in the conflict.There could be some winners, if European manufacturers such as ABB and Siemens win market share in China at the expense of US rivals such as Honeywell.But higher trade barriers are likely to hurt most economies, leaving even the winners with a smaller market to work with.CommoditiesChina buys about a third of its soybeans from the United States so Beijing's move to slap 25 percent duties on US soybean imports has made the commodity a key battlefield.It will raise the cost of soymeal, which is used in China to feed pigs and poultry. China's most active soymeal futures rose 4.2 percent on Tuesday (19/06).Soybean prices tend to be affected more by weather than economic factors, but tit-for-tat tariffs might shift trade flows. US CBOT soy futures have tumbled to multi-year lows as US suppliers may now lose a chunk of China's market to Latin American rivals.Finally, prices for copper, a metal widely used in the construction and power industries, have fallen to their lowest since May 31. Copper prices can be expected to tumble further if world growth slides.Reuters",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will retaliate if the United States insists on initiating a trade war, China's ambassador to the United States was quoted as saying by the state news agency Xinhua on Friday.Speaking at an event held by the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University this week, Cui Tiankai said any dispute should be worked out through dialogue and a trade war would poison the atmosphere of overall China-U.S. relations.Cui also urged the United States to abandon a cold war and zero-sum mentality, Xinhua reported.(Reporting by Beijing Monitoring Desk; editing Darren Schuettler)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You may not have noticed it amid the White Houseâ€™s bluster on NATO this week, but Congress utterly face-planted in its effort to rein in President Donald Trumpâ€™s ever-escalating global trade war.As The Washington Post reports, the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate courageously approved a non-binding resolution that says Congress should have â€œa roleâ€? when the White House imposes tariffs for national security reasons.The resolution, which came after retiring U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., dropped his demands for a â€œsubstantiveâ€? measure constraining the presidentâ€™s ability to impose tariffs, does not actually say what the role should be.Flake said heâ€™d hold up filling federal circuit court vacancies until he got that vote. Then he folded like a cheap suit in exchange for that toothless language, the newspaper reported.The â€˜motion to instructâ€™ was so harmless that it passed on an 88-11 vote, The Post reported.In case you missed it, the White House is using national security concerns for its slender justification for slapping punitive tariffs on steel imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union - who are actual U.S. allies.Itâ€™s also hitting China, a geopolitical rival, with steep tariffs.Canadian officials, including Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, have each decried the White Houseâ€™s heavy-handed tactics. And Canada has moved to impose punitive tariffs on American goods in retaliation.As The Post reported, Trump is threatening to invoke that same standard to hit foreign cars, distorting the intent of the 1962 tariff law. But this White House has never been one to be deterred by such formalities.â€œItâ€™s a non-binding vote, but if we had a substantive vote, it would fail today,â€? Flake said. â€œTo put members on record, 88 of them, in support of Congress having a role in determining the national security implications of [Section 232] of the tariff law is substantive.â€?No itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s a joke. And itâ€™s an abdication of Congressâ€™ authority.There is an easy way for the Senate to determine what its role should be, It could stand up, exercise its power as a co-equal branch of government, and vote on tariffs imposed on national security grounds.But it wonâ€™t.Of course, the phenomenon is hardly new. Congress, under both parties, has been gradually surrendering its power to the White House for years now. On issues from immigration to war-making, the co-equal branch of government has only been too happy to leave the heavy lifting to the occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.â€œCongress has been dropping in relative power along a descending curve of 60 yearsâ€™ duration, with the rate of fall markedly increased since 1933... The fall of the American Congress seems to be correlated with a more general historical transformation toward political and social forms within which the representative assembly - the major political organism of post-Renaissance Western civilization - does not have a primary political function.â€?American political theorist James Burnhan wrote those words ... in 1959. The curve has only grown steeper since, conservative columnist George F. Will wrote in late 2017.And true to form, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blocked an effort by Republican Sens. Pat Toomey and Bob Corker to close a national security loophole on the issue of trade.Senior Republicans, who have proven spectacularly inept at standing up to the White House, are even more reluctant to do so in a mid-term election year when thereâ€™s a chance that Democrats could flip the chamber in November.The pointless vote (sort of) immunizes Republicans facing tough re-election races (especially in farm country) from accusations that they didnâ€™t up stand up to the White House on polices that are potentially destructive for their home states.The House is even worse. There, retiring Speaker Paul J. Ryan, R-Wisc., has said he has zero plans to try to rein in the White House. And Ryan opposes the tariffs.Still, thereâ€™s almost zero downside for the White House in the face of this Congressional acquiescence. A Post poll found that, among the 15 hardest hit states, Trumpâ€™s approval rating stands at 57 percent.And with lawmakers more concerned about self-preservation in November than their constitutional prerogatives, thatâ€™s reason enough to play along.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Copyright 2018 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:A trade war with China is on today. At 12:01 Eastern time today, the United States fired the first shots in that war by imposing tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods. So a trade war that had been discussed, that had been threats, that had been words, is now real. And China has responded, hitting American goods with equivalent tariffs. This is a real economic gamble by President Trump. The world's two biggest economies are now involved in these trade actions, and NPR's Rob Schmitz has been following the story from Shanghai. Hi there, Rob.ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.INSKEEP: OK. So just talk us through the practicalities here. President Trump uses authority that he's been given by Congress to raise taxes, raise taxes on things that Americans import from China. China responds on American products. What happens then?SCHMITZ: Well, then, you know, these tariffs will be passed on to consumers, both in the U.S. and China, as the companies whose products are targeted stop exporting and start to scramble to find new markets for their goods. That, of course, will mean higher prices for a range of products. Eventually, this is going to have a big impact on the flow of goods worldwide, as well as jobs. I spoke to longtime Beijing attorney James Zimmerman about this today, and here's what he said we can expect.JAMES ZIMMERMAN: What we can expect is disruption in supply chains. We can expect job losses and a decline in investor and consumer confidence. And that's going to impact the stock market. And the impact on U.S. business is going to be - in my opinion, will be substantial.INSKEEP: I'm glad that he mentioned supply chains, Rob, 'cause it's not that China sells me directly a product as a consumer. They're selling something to an American company. The product might even go back and forth between the U.S. and China and other countries several times. So how will U.S. businesses be affected here?SCHMITZ: Well I've spoken to folks in the U.S. business community here, and they're telling me that China's government is already targeting their products in ways that sort of go beyond tariffs in unofficial ways. You know, they've seen customs officials inspecting more shipments of U.S. goods, slowing down business in other ways. On the Chinese side, China's government is now targeting Chinese tourism to the U.S. The Chinese embassy in Washington has issued a warning to Chinese tourists to be careful of shootings in the U.S., to watch out for customs agents, robberies and things like that. It's a clear message from them that Beijing has the power to prevent its tourists, as well, from spending money in the U.S.INSKEEP: It's kind of like the soft equivalent of a tariff to respond on U.S. tariffs. Suppose it could end well. How would it end well? What is the best scenario here?SCHMITZ: Well, I suppose the best scenario would be for China to say, yes, you're right. We'll give in and start treating U.S. businesses fairly and stop forcing them into joint ventures and stop requiring them to transfer their technology to China. But, you know, that's not really what's happening here. China's responding, as we've seen, with equivalent tariffs, and it's made no discernible moves towards changing these policies that seem to anger the Trump administration.INSKEEP: Where you are in China, how are people on the streets or on social media or elsewhere responding?SCHMITZ: I think there's a lot of confusion, Steve. You know, the Trump administration fired the first shot in this trade war. China's government insisted it's being forced to retaliate. So Chinese people I've spoken to say that this is U.S. aggression against China. And at least in urban China, you know, these are people who drive American cars. They wear clothes with U.S. labels. They use iPhones and they use iPads on a daily basis. So they're thinking, look, you know, we're buying American goods. Why is America targeting us? And that confusion can easily lead to a sense of anti-Americanism if this trade dispute gets worse.INSKEEP: NPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai. Thanks.SCHMITZ: Thanks.

"Posted: Saturday, April 7th, 2018 at 4:59 amAuthor: KNIA/KRLS News - Andrew SchneiderWhile farmers anxiously wait to see if President Donald Trumpâ€™s and Chinaâ€™s proposed tariffs impact agriculture exports, many of Iowaâ€™s state and federal leaders are concerned with the economic fallout if they are implemented.Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig was in Leighton Thursday and told KNIA/KRLS News the impact potential tariffs from China may have on numerous Iowa exports, including soybeans and pork, could be trouble for producers in the state.U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley says he and other midwestern federal representatives and senators warned President Trump about the negative impacts a tariff war could have with China.President Trump has argued the tariffs on China are necessary because Chinaâ€™s trade practices have led to the loss of many American jobs and to combat intellectual property theft.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BEIJING (Reuters) â€“ A vessel carrying U.S. soybeans was unloading its cargo worth at least $23 million at the Chinese port of Dalian on Monday, becoming one of the first shipments to incur hefty new import duties as the trade row deepens between Beijing and Washington.The docking of the vessel after five weeks anchored off Chinaâ€™s coast ended long-running speculation over the fate of the cargo, which had captured public attention.Chinaâ€™s state grains stockpiler Sinograin confirmed in a fax to Reuters it will pay the additional 25 percent import tariff on its 70,000 tonne cargo of the oilseed. That equates to about $6 million.Comments on the countryâ€™s Twitter-like Weibo showed early public support for the cargo had started to wane amid concerns that the public is footing the bill for the prolonged trade war.â€œIsnâ€™t Sinograin state-owned? Who is this tariff hurting? Eventually it is us paying the tariffs and itâ€™s us being sanctioned!â€? said one user.Two posts about the shipâ€™s arrival in dock and the extra costs generated more than 800 comments, mostly negative.â€œAre we imposing sanction on ourselves? Common people will have to pay for that,â€? said another Weibo user.Peak Pegasus, a cargo vessel carrying soybeans from the U.S., is seen docked at a port in Dalian, Liaoning province, China, on an Eikon ship-tracking screen, in this illustration picture taken August 12, 2018. REUTERS/Florence Lo/IllustrationPeak Pegasus started unloading its cargo on Saturday, a port official said on Monday, more than a month after it arrived off Chinaâ€™s coast just hours after Beijing imposed 25 percent import duties on $34 billion worth of U.S. goods, including soybeans.TRADE DISPUTEThe penalties were in retaliation for moves by Washington as part of a tit-for-tat trade dispute between the worldâ€™s two largest economies.Last week, Washington said it would start collecting tariffs on another $16 billion worth of Chinese imports from Aug. 23, as it tries to pressure China to negotiate trade concessions. Beijing has said it will retaliate in kind.Soybeans, which are used to make cooking oil and animal feed, are the top U.S. agricultural export to China, with the trade worth $12.7 billion in 2017.In the fax to Reuters, Sinograin said the cargo was delayed by port congestion, although two officials at Dalian port said they hadnâ€™t seen major backlogs since June.Two other ships carrying U.S. soybeans, Star Jennifer and Cemtex Pioneer, have been anchored off Chinaâ€™s coast for the past few weeks.This is unlikely to be the start of a trend while China, the worldâ€™s top importer, can source alternative supplies from exporters such as Brazil, analysts said. Domestic stockpiles are 8.21 million tonnes, close to their highest on records.Why some Chinese are less keen on U.S. goodsâ€œPeak Pegasus is just an extreme case since it failed to make the deadline. Sinograin had to pay for the lesson,â€? said Tian Hao, analyst from First Futures. â€œBut for other buyers, they have turned to other sources such as Brazil.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A man uses his mobile phone at the G20 Meeting of Finance Ministers in Buenos Aires March 20, 2018. â€” Reuters picBUENOS AIRES, March 21 â€” The world's financial leaders rejected protectionism yesterday and urged â€œfurther dialogueâ€? on trade, but failed to diffuse the threat of a trade war days before US metals tariffs take effect and Washington is to announce measures against China.Finance ministers and central bankers of the world's 20 biggest economies, which represent 75 per cent of world trade and 85 per cent of global gross domestic product, discussed trade disruptions as a risk to growth at a two-day meeting.But after talks described by participants as â€œpoliteâ€? and mainly consisting of read-out statements with no debate, the G20 agreed only to stand by an ambiguous declaration on trade from 2017 and â€œrecogniseâ€? the need for more â€œdialogue and actions.â€?â€œWe reaffirm the conclusions of our leaders on trade at the Hamburg Summit and recognize the need for further dialogue and actions. We are working to strengthen contribution of trade to our economies,â€? the final G20 ministers' statement said.But the declaration did little to dispel concern over a global trade war as the United States' tariffs of 25 per cent on imported steel and 10 per cent on aluminum take effect on Friday.Two officials briefed on the matter said US President Donald Trump would also unveil tariffs on up to US$60 billion (RM234.9 billion) in Chinese technology and telecoms products by Friday, a move stemming from Beijing's intellectual property practices.The 2017 Hamburg declaration, which the financial leaders referred to yesterday, said G20 countries would â€œcontinue to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices.â€?But it also said G20 leaders â€œrecognise the role of legitimate trade defense instruments,â€? an ambiguity which provides the United States with a way to argue its cause on the tariffs.US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made clear Washington's tariff action was such a legitimate defense.â€œWe need to be prepared to act in the US interest, again, to defend free and fair, reciprocal trade,â€? he said in a press conference after the talks, adding that there was always a risk that others would reciprocate.â€œThere's a risk of a trade war, the president has said we're not afraid of getting into a trade war, given the size of our market, the size of our economy, and the fact that we have a big trade deficit,â€? Mnuchin said.â€œOn the steel and aluminum issue, this is a result of unfair trade practices and that's why we've responded that way.â€?Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau, comparing this G20 meeting to the one in Germany last year when Mnuchin demanded a rewrite of the longstanding communique language on trade, said the rest of the world now has a better sense of the US view on how the rules of trade should be reworked.â€œThere's not a consensus, everyone around the table doesn't have the same point of view, but there's a greater understanding of what it is they're trying to achieve,â€? Morneau said.Europe ready to retaliateThe European Union, the biggest US trading partner, wants to be exempt from the metals tariffs like Canada and Mexico, but so far has not had any success.The EU, as a result, is preparing retaliatory tariffs on US products ranging from bourbon and jeans to Harley-Davidson motorcycles.European officials said a trade war would produce only losers and the G20 were united in support of â€œmultilateralismâ€? â€” G20 jargon for solving disputes through negotiations in the World Trade Organisation.â€œWe all agreed trade wars are a negative sum game,â€? Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco told reporters on the sidelines of the meeting. â€œThere hasn't been any voice against rule-based multilateralism.â€?French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire stressed Europe expected to get exemptions from the US tariffs without any conditions and warned protectionism would hurt world growth.â€œIt is of the utmost importance to avoid any unilateral choice that might jeopardise our growth. Unfair trade conditions, protectionism might jeopardise the economic recovery all over the world,â€? he said.Mnuchin said he has had very direct conversations with his counterparts in China and that he looks forward to working with Liu He, China's newly-installed, Harvard-educated vice premier in charge of financial and industrial policy, on getting better access to the Chinese market.â€œI think there's a general view among the G20 that it is our desire to see China open their markets so that we can participate in their markets the way they participate in ours in a much more ... reciprocal ... relationship,â€? Mnuchin said.The G20 also called for continued international monitoring of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, and the risks they posed.It said these assets raised issues with consumer and investor protections, market integrity, money laundering and terrorist financing. â€” Reuters",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wilbur L. Ross, US Secretary of Commerce, attends the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland January 24, 2018. â€” Reuters picDAVOS, Jan 25 â€” The United States is not starting a trade war but trying to level the playing field of global commerce and fend off Chinese protectionism, including a â€œdirect threatâ€? in high-tech goods, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on yesterday.Ross was speaking a day after Washington imposed steep import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels, billed as a way to protect American jobs by President Donald Trump, who is widely expected to take further action on steel, aluminium and intellectual property.â€œThe Chinese have been for quite a little while been superb at free trade rhetoric and even more superb at highly protectionist behaviour,â€? Ross said.The â€œnext area of challengeâ€? would be China's high tech ambitions under its 2025 plan, which aimed to make China a world leader with enormous market share â€œin most all of the new technologies that you can name and spell,â€? Ross said.â€œThat is a direct threat. And it is a direct threat that is being implemented by technology transfers, by disrespect for intellectual property rights, by commercial espionage, by all kinds of very bad things. So it isnâ€™t just the overcapacity in the historic industries.â€?He said US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was working very hard on investigating on intellectual property, but his report was not expected for some time.Ross was speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, alongside business leaders and World Trade Organisation chief Roberto Azevedo, who said he expected China to dispute Trump's trade challenges.â€œI think China is going to respond to those complaints, saying that that is within the rules,â€? Azevedo said.Earlier on Tuesday Jack Ma, the founder of China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, said he was scared by the prospect of a trade war, which he described as a disaster.â€œIf you want to launch a trade war itâ€™s easy, but it takes about 30 years to fix that pain,â€? Ma said.Ross played down the idea that the United States was starting a trade war.â€œNobody is trying to ignite a gigantic thing like Smoot-Hawley did during the Depression,â€? he said, referring to a protectionist 1930 law that raised thousands of US tariffs.But he also gave a nonchalant response to South Korea's vow to challenge the latest US tariffs at the WTO.â€œThe fact that they may get a favourable decision (at the WTO) doesnâ€™t mean that itâ€™s a correct decision,â€? he said.Hand-written notesTrump's administration has also been accused of courting a trade war by vetoing new WTO appeals judges, hobbling the trade dispute settlement system and running the risk that trade friction will explode into tit-for-tat actions.The United States has not said what would persuade it to lift its veto on WTO judges and Ross declined to elaborate.'I think we should negotiate that in the conference room not in the press room,â€? he said.Azevedo said the United States had concerns about the system after it exposed shortcomings in its trade practices and said the US veto would significantly slow litigation, but may not stop it altogether.Ross, who was clutching a pad with notes hand-written in blue ink, reading 'NAFTA, Tax Reform, [email protected], Tariffs', said the United States had supported the world trading system for too long without demanding reform.But he steered away from suggestions that the United States was giving up on the WTO, saying that the world still needed an arbiter and needed to avoid 'a total free-for-all,' even if it did not agree with every aspect.â€œWe donâ€™t intend to abrogate leadership but leadership is different from being a sucker and being a patsy,â€? he said. â€” Reuters",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Economists are making dire predictions about the potential effect of a trade war on the domestic auto industry.Officials in Washington and Ottawa are announcing tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as auto parts. Most cars and trucks built in America are assembled from parts produced in Canada and elsewhere. And, many vehicles assembled in Canada are built with parts produced in the U.S. The vehicles are sold on both sides of the border.Brian DePratto is an economist with TD Bank.He says if both sides impose protective tariffs, one in ten Canadian auto workers will lose their jobs over the next three years. The number jumps to one in five in Ontario, the province most heavily tied to the auto industry.DePratto says tariffs will increase new car and truck prices higher than consumers will want to pay.â€œYou know, putting a 25% tax, which is what this is, on top of that can really change those spending decisions,â€? says DePratto. â€œSo it really has that slowing effect both in terms of the production side and consumer side.â€?But another study suggests a trade war with Canada, China and other U.S. trading partners could have a significant impact on American auto workers.Mary Lovely is an economist at Syracuse University. Sheâ€™s also a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The institute recently released its own study predicting a widening trade war may reduce domestic auto sales by nearly 10%.Lovely says the slowdown in demand may cost 195,000 U.S. auto workers their jobs.â€œThere is a very concerted effort to disrupt supply chains of multi-national firmsâ€¦. This does not bode well for the health of the automobile industry,â€? says Lovely.Lovely predicts a damaging trade war may mean the permanent loss of those jobs.But TD Bank economist Brian DePratto says there may be silver lining.â€œRight now, weâ€™re just talking about this as a risk,â€? says DePratto. â€œThe reality is hopefully there will be recognition this is not something that really benefits anybody.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stateside's conversation with Daniel Howes, Detroit News business columnist.One month ago, President Trump tweeted, 'Trade wars are good, and easy to win.'When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, donâ€™t trade anymore-we win big. Itâ€™s easy! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2018As the US and China get closer to a trade war, we may soon find out if he's right.On Wednesday, China swung back hard against the President's proposed tariffs on 1,300 Chinese imports. Beijing says it intends to slap 25 percent duties on the top products the US exports to China: airplanes, soybeans, and cars. That adds up to $50 billion in retaliatory tariffs.Daniel Howes, Detroit News business columnist, joined Stateside to share what that means for automakers.Listen to the conversation above to hear how worried the companies seem, how Howes thinks negotiations might play out, and how the industry's connections with the current administration could make a difference.(Subscribe to the Stateside podcast on iTunes, Google Play, or with this RSS link)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) â€“ Farmers of Minnesotaâ€™s largest export are expressing concern after China proposed a 25 percent tariff on soybeans. On Wednesday, soybean futures took a sharp decline on the Chicago Board of Trade. They fell 40 cents a bushel, or 2 percent. Soybean futures are up 10 percent from one year ago. Still, Minnesota farmers are worried about a trade war with the largest consumer of U.S. Soybeans.â€œRight now farm economy is really struggling, farm incomes are down 50 percent since 2013,â€? Minnesota Soybean Farmers Association Board President Michael Petefish said.Petefish said the proposed 25 percent tariff on soybeans to China is another challenge facing an already tight farming economy. He is also a soybean farmer.â€œWe have a good thing going with agriculture products. We need to sell soybeans to China, China needs to buy our soybeans so leave it alone,â€? Petefish said.He says if states export less, it would also affect the price in this country.â€œIf thereâ€™s not an export market for that grain theyâ€™re not going to pay as much locally. That means thereâ€™s more soybeans locally. That means end users donâ€™t have to pay as much. You start getting the local price depressed,â€? Petefish explained.Itâ€™s a fear felt by many Minnesota soybean farmers. Farmer Cole Trebesch said the trickle down of a tariff could affect the sustainability of rural parts of the state.â€œSoy in Minnesota creates a lot of jobs, its Minnesotaâ€™s largest export,â€? Trebesch said.Chinese tariffs wonâ€™t take effect immediately. Farmers hope by the next soybean harvest, the two countries will have ended what farmers are calling a game of chicken.â€œWe donâ€™t feel you can balance a trade deficit on the backs of farmers. Our hope is cooler heads prevail,â€? Petefish said.On Wednesday the president tweeted about the tariffs:We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 4, 2018His press secretary said it would be a few months before tariffs on both sides go into effect and theyâ€™re hopeful China will do the right thing.Minnesota is the fourth leading exporter of soybeans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"China isn't doing much to cool concerns about a trade war with the United States.'China would fight to the end to defend its own legitimate interests with all necessary measures,' China's embassy in Washington said in a statement late Thursday. 'China is not afraid of and will not recoil from a trade war.'President Trump announced earlier that his administration would impose tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese exports to the United States to retaliate against Chinese theft of intellectual property, including software and patents. The administration will also restrict Chinese investment in the United States.The statement from the Chinese embassy said Trump's trade action was 'self-defeating' and would hurt American companies, consumers and financial markets.'We urge the US to cease and desist, make cautious decisions, and avoid placing China-U.S. trade relations in danger with the purpose of hurting others that eventually end up hurting itself,' the statement said.Fears of a trade war between the world's two largest economies rocked the stock market on Thursday. The Dow fell 724 points, or almost 3%.Related: Dow plunges 724 points as trade war fears rock Wall StreetThe administration said it would announce in the next 15 days which products would be subject to tariffs.After a seven-month investigation, the office of the US Trade Representative concluded that China hurts US technology companies in a variety of ways.For example, when American tech companies want access to China's market, China forces them to enter joint ventures with its own companies, the USTR said. The American companies are forced to share software, patents and tech secrets, which Chinese firms then steal and use to push the Americans out of the market.The Chinese embassy in Washington said that China 'has demonstrated sincerity in making reasonable suggestions to the US, and has made great efforts to address the current trade imbalance between China and the US.'US officials widely agree that China has stolen US technology and trade secrets. Many economists say the administration's diagnosis of the problem is correct. But they fear that widespread US tariffs, and Chinese retaliation, will raise prices significantly for Americans, hurt the economy and kill jobs.Trump administration officials say fears of a trade war are overblown. However, they concede they're worried about retaliation.Trump's crackdown on China came shortly after US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announced that more countries will be exempt from the steel and aluminum tariffs that Trump announced three weeks ago.Those penalties â€” 10% on aluminum imports and 25% on steel imports â€” take effect Friday. But they will not apply to the European Union, South Korea, Argentina, Brazil or Australia.

"After months of threats and skirmishes, the trade war between the United States and China is about to get serious.On Friday, the world's top two economies are due to exchange fire by hitting $34 billion of each other's exports with steep new tariffs, the first moves in what may become a devastating cycle of retaliation.The planned measures have already unsettled markets and provoked warnings from companies of damage to their bottom lines and higher prices for consumers.President Donald Trump and his advisers argue the tariffs are necessary to pressure China into abandoning unfair practices such as stealing intellectual property and forcing American companies to hand over valuable technology.Beijing denies it's in the wrong and says it's ready to fight a trade war until the end.'The United States will be opening fire on the whole world and also opening fire on itself,' Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters on Thursday. He warned that the US tariffs will hurt foreign companies that export goods from China to the United States.Underpinning the dispute about technology is Trump's anger at America's $375 billion deficit in goods trade with China. But after three rounds of negotiations between the two sides, including a Chinese pledge to significantly increase purchases of American products, Trump decided to go ahead with the tariffs.Related: China's economy shows signs of slowing. A trade war won't helpThe clash with China comes as the Trump administration is also fighting over trade with American allies such as Canada and the European Union. US tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have provoked retaliatory measures against billions of dollars of American exports. Trump has added to the tension by threatening new tariffs on cars.China won't 'fire the first shot'The US tariffs on China target more than 800 different items, including industrial machinery, medical devices and auto parts. Beijing plans to fire back by hitting 545 American products such as SUVs, meat and seafood.The US measures are expected to take effect first, shortly after midnight ET on Friday. That's around midday in Beijing, and the Chinese government will wait until then to retaliate, as it 'will never fire the first shot but will be forced to strike back,' Gao said.The United States is also set to go ahead with tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese exports later in the summer, and China has vowed to retaliate against US goods of equal value.Economists say that if the tariffs stop there, the impact on both economies will be small.But Trump has said his administration will respond to retaliation from Beijing with much bigger waves of tariffs, raising the prospect of worsening tit-for-tat reprisals. On Thursday, he raised the possibility of tariffs on almost $500 billion more of Chinese goods.He described the possible escalation to reporters aboard Air Force One: 'Thirty-four, and then you have another 16 in two weeks and then, as you know, we have 200 billion in abeyance and then after the 200 billion we have 300 billion in abeyance. OK?' Trump said. 'So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300.'The US imported $505 billion of goods from China last year.Related: Daimler warns US-China trade war will hit its profitsFor the time being, analysts say it's hard to see either side backing down.'By threatening unilateral action without having any allies and not reducing domestic discord on trade, the Trump administration has invited China to stand tough,' said Scott Kennedy, director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.'The Trump administration also believes that at least starting a trade war is in its interests; the US economy is strong enough to endure a crimp in trade, the president's domestic political standing is as strong as ever amongst Republicans, and pushing China hard on trade may help restore US credibility on other issues,' he added.Who can take the most pain?The two giant economies appear ready to see which side can endure the most pain. The damage could also spread to other economies, hurting business confidence and prompting companies to delay investments.Fears over the impact of the trade clash have rattled markets around the world, with China's stocks and currency coming under particular pressure in recent weeks.Kennedy say he thinks the Trump administration's enthusiasm for the conflict 'will erode as the economic pain and political fallout from a trade war begin to take hold. At that point, the US will be more interested in negotiations, and the Chinese side will also want to come to the table.'Related: US-China trade war will spill into other Asian economiesBut reaching a deal that's palatable to both sides will be tough. For example, the US government wants China to rein in government subsidies for policies like 'Made in China 2025,' which seeks to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into industries such as robotics, electric cars and computer chips with the aim of becoming a global leader.Analysts say China is unlikely to budge on those plans, which it sees as crucial for developing its huge economy.'It's still hard for me to believe the Trump administration could develop and negotiate an overarching package with China that genuinely sticks,' Kennedy said. 'And so I'd expect the two sides to pursue some sort of face-saving deal that looks good on paper but is not enduring.'-- Steven Jiang and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chinadaily / [Photo/VCG] Like slowly moving tectonic plates, in which at first there is no perceptible movement, only to be followed later by a jarring earthquake, the ground is finally shifting in the trade war between the United States and China.This trade war is not just about trade, which would be easy to fix, but about the geopolitical and economic rise of China. The Chinese offer to purchase more US agricultural products was an example of how progress could have been made in resolving a pure trade deficit issue, if that was the case.The US, under the present leadership team, feels threatened by the ever-evolving position of China and especially the stellar rise in Chinese self-sufficiency with regard to new technologies, the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution. It was all fine when China was â€œthe factory of the worldâ€?, producing goods also for US companies and benefiting millions of US citizens with low-cost consumer goods, but the Chinese high-tech planning has really caught the attention of the White House. The plan seems to have riled the US administration because it aims to integrate the latest technologies to create a much more efficient industrial base, and most notably the aim to become less dependent on foreign technology.It must be remembered that the close advisers to US President Donald Trump include Peter Navarro (69), the most extreme advocate of an aggressive stance towards China, (and author of Death by China), and Larry Kudlow (71), best known for his previous life as a television host on economic matters which he often got wrong. Many of the acknowledged and experienced China experts have either left the State Department, or are being ignored, creating a unique situation in which there seems to be no balanced and objective strategic China discussion in the White House.The approach of the Trump administration therefore is simplistic, purely transactional, and reveals a serious lack of understanding of both modern-day China, and of the significant benefits that global trade?and Chinaâ€™s accession to the World Trade Organization?has brought to the US.Carrot-and-stick ploy to reverse Chinaâ€™s progressIn a nutshell, the US approach is as follows: attempt the carrot-and-stick approach with trade tariffs as the stick, and ZTE as the carrot, in order to reverse Chinaâ€™s progress in automation and the development and acquisition of new technologies.There are some serious deficiencies in this approach.Firstly, the â€œMade in China 2025â€? cited by the US critics is a consolidation of things that were already happening on the ground. Companies were, and are, evolving and exploring efficiencies to keep on growing in a rapidly changing environment. The last-mover advantage enables many newer Chinese companies to be more flexible, and take advantage of the latest technologies at lower cost, in a way that many Western companies burdened by their legacies cannot. The point is that even without official government plans, many elements of the plan would have happened anyway.Secondly, demographics plays an important role in the Chinese strategy. The old â€œfactory of the worldâ€? role was made possible by migrant workers moving to the Pearl River Delta and other areas. This approach will no longer be possible in the future as the seemingly endless pool of migrant workers will decrease due to the aging society, as well as the economic development in the poor interior provinces thereby reducing the need to migrate. Chinese companies have a need to explore the latest technologies in robotics and artificial intelligence, as their potential labor force shrinks sharply in a generation.Thirdly, the envisaged efficiencies have a positive impact on the environment. As production companies embrace new technologies, their production processes become greener and cleaner and less labor intensive. New automation technology both reduces the amounts of materials wasted, and minimizes the energy used. A cleaner, greener China is now a top priority of the Chinese government, and hence the focus on acquiring and developing the latest technologies. It is also of the utmost importance for Chinaâ€™s environmental focus and obligations under the Paris Agreement.US strategy to contain China will backfireFor the reasons mentioned above, China will not, and cannot, move away from its aim to develop the latest technologies and become a world-class player. The trade war therefore already begins on a false premise that the Chinese strategy will change. Furthermore, Trumpâ€™s â€œhot and coldâ€? approach to ZTE has underlined one thing for the Chinese government: that China must reduce its dependence on foreign companies, so as not to have key areas of its industry be at the mercy of a foreign government. This key strategic insight runs exactly contrary to what the US wishes, but such unintended consequence happens when a new policy is not rigorously examined before implementation.The Chinese government has indicated that it will counter US import tariffs in a proportionate manner and will use the auspices of the World Trade Organization to get them reversed. Every subsequent US tariff will have a counterpart on the Chinese side. This is the most reasonable response.Chinaâ€™s counter-tariffs will obviously hurt US companies exporting to China, and hopefully that will bring some common sense back into the White House. Political pressure from the US companies impacted should play a role in working towards an end to this trade war, especially as we come closer to the mid-term elections in November.When there are differences between nations, they should resort to existing mechanisms which were created specifically for such eventualities. And they have proven their effectiveness time and time again. Unfortunately, the US administration will not realize the futility of its current approach in dealing with China before November.The author is founding partner of Polarwide Ltd., a financial and strategic advisory firm.

"Chinadaily / China will take immediate action to ensure its own interests if it is forced into a trade war with the United States, a senior commerce official said on Sunday.Vice-Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen said the Section 232 action by the US to impose tariffs on its steel and aluminum imports from a number of countries, including China, for national security reasons was clearly a unilateral trade protectionist measure.He also said that it posed a major threat to global trade.'Trade restrictions launched by the US will not only damage the World Trade Organization principles, but will also cause serious damage to the multilateral global trading system,' he said.Wang, also Chinaâ€™s deputy international trade representative, made the remarks at the China Development Forum 2018 in Beijing.'China has no wish to have a trade war with any country, including the US,' he said.Wang also said that Chinaâ€™s steel exports to the US only account for 3 percent of that countryâ€™s imports, and therefore the economic impact is being exaggerated by the White House.He said there was no way the steel imports could be a national security threat to the US because they are such a small percentage of overall trade.His comments came as US President Donald Trump, after threatening to impose hefty tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum early this month, signed a memorandum on Thursday that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion worth of imports from China and restrict Chinese investment in the US.Long Guoqiang, vice-president of the Development Research Center of the State Council, said there also are numerous factors, including different comparative advantages and industrial structures, behind the imbalance in China-US trade and the issue cannot be resolved all at once.'China has the global competitive edge in terms of labor-intensive products, while the US has the global advantage in terms of skill-intensive products and the services industry,' he said.'The two countries are also at different positions within the global value chain, with China on the downstream end and the US on the upstream end.'Wei Jianguo, former vice-minister of commerce, said the US only speaks of the deficit in trade of goods and ignores its own services trade surplus, which doesnâ€™t allow for a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the complementary and mutually beneficial relationship of bilateral trade.'A trade war will be a loss for both sides. The US government frequently threatens to suppress Chinese exports to the US with the aim of obtaining open access to Chinaâ€™s market to gain more benefits at the expense of China,' said Wei.A study conducted by the Development Research Center demonstrates that even if China doesnâ€™t take retaliatory trade measures, the number of jobs created in the US by increasing US exports to China may not make up for the number of jobs lost as a result of a reduction in imports from China.If China takes retaliatory measures, China itself also may lose 17.5 million jobs and that would greatly exceed job losses in the US. Therefore, a trade war would make both sides losers and should not be an option.Lawrence Summers, a former US Treasury secretary, said the US cannot hope to restrain Chinaâ€™s rise. Instead of trying to go in that direction, the US should build on its unique advantage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hear the radio version of this storyThe U.S.-China trade war is going to have a drastic impact on Tennesseeâ€™s agricultural exports, worth $1.4 billion as of 2016.Specifically, soybean farmers will be hit especially hard. Tennesseeâ€™s farms exported nearly half a billion dollars worth of soybeans, mostly to China.Even the threat of a trade war was enough to send national soybean prices to a nine-year-low in May. While prices have slightly recovered, farmers are preparing for worse.â€œWeâ€™re not making a lot of money, even at the margins that we have,â€? West Tennessee farmer Ben Moore said. â€œSo whenever you take another dollar or so off the price of soybeans, it makes it pretty tough.â€?The retaliatory tariffs could have a lasting impact even if they get reversed as China develops infrastructure in Brazil and Argentina to harvest soybeans.â€œBrazilian soybean exporters will benefit from these retaliatory tariffs just due to the fact that these tariffs will make U.S. soybeans relatively less competitive,â€? Agriculture and Resource Economics Professor Andrew Muhammad said.Muhammad worked on a report about the potential impact of the tariffs. His research showed that â€œfor every dollar we lose in exports to China, the Brazilians gain a dollar.â€?The soybean tariffs could have a ripple effect on the rest of the economy.â€œItâ€™s a much larger issue than the farmer himself,â€? Tennessee Commissioner of Agriculture Jai Templeton said. â€œItâ€™s going to be suppliers, lending institutions, or those who have bought farmland over the years from an investment perspective. It can have a negative implication for them as well.â€?Farmers will be hit from both sides. The American steel and aluminum tariffs will make equipment cost more while the Chinese soybean tariffs will make harvests less profitable.Still, Moore doesnâ€™t blame the president. He blames China for going after farmers.â€œThe American farmer is a scapegoat right now,â€? Moore said. â€œI just hope we can get this trade war worked out and we can go back to having a good trade relationship with all countries.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most would agree with the general proposition that the United States-China relationship, at this particular juncture of history, is the worldâ€™s most important bilateral relationship . That relationship is vital for maintaining some semblance of global order and for preventing the widespread proliferation of nuclear weapons. It is also vital to continuing global economic growth while staving off the real prospect of environmental devastation . Yet, after a promising start at Mar-a-Lago, U.S.-China relations have gone badly off the rails and now are teetering above the abyss. Even as the real prospect of bloodshed in either the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea continues to emerge, a trade war [???] that threatens to split apart the world's two largest economies has all but commenced and could well have tragic consequences. Most palpably for the current administration, this trade war with China will almost certainly mean the failure of the North Korea deal that was recently brokered in Singapore.That must be the case because everyone knows that China is the key lynchpin of that agreement. If anyone needed reminding of Beijingâ€™s influence on the Korean Peninsula, Kim Jong-un made his third trip to China last week. The â€œmaximum pressureâ€? strategy previously cornered the North Korean leader, but that strategy could only be effective if Beijing stuck with stringent sanctions, which already appear to be softening . Beyond that, as I have pointed out previously in this forum, China likely provides the only feasible route to true denuclearization.That could be achieved in five reasonably simple steps. First, Chinese arms control specialists make an accounting of the North Korean nuclear arsenal. Second, China's fine logistics network (roads and rails) are used to move the weapons out of North Korea and over the Yalu in an efficient manner. Third, China can warehouse North Korea's arsenal in Northeast China in a way that safeguards the weapons and yet also allows for nominal North Korean custody within a â€œdual keyâ€? system. Fourth, China confirms the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Friendship Treaty of 1961 and thus reaffirms its commitment to protect North Korea from external aggression. Fifth, China sends some number of frigates, fighter aircraft, tanks and other â€œtoysâ€? to North Korea to salve the pride of the North Korean military in the wake of denuclearization. Regrettably, however, what seemed possible only some weeks ago is likely now going up in smoke thanks to acute trade tensions in U.S.-China relations.Through all of 2017, Chinese leaders seem to have been deliberating over whether the Trump Administration constitutes a first-order threat to Beijing. With the Taiwan and trade issues now coming to the fore of Trump administration policies, the answer is now becoming quite clear, from Chinaâ€™ s point of view. In a zero-sum world, Beijing â€™s strategic choices are relatively straightforward, and they are now hardly disposed to do Washington any favors regarding the Korea negotiations. Indeed, China will almost certainly strike back, not least because Xi Jinping cannot afford to appear weak in confronting U.S. pressure. And unfortunately for the United States, China's position in the trade dispute turns out to be much stronger than many in Washington have long supposed.Chinese strategists seem to have been mulling the U.S.-China trade predicament for decades. Indeed, the â€œBelt and Road Initiativeâ€? was never intended as a geostrategic maneuver as some have speculated, but instead was always a hedge, lest the United States and its allies seek to corner and isolate the Middle Kingdom. Why does China need millions of American shoppers, if instead, it can entice billions of consumers across Eurasia, the Middle East, and Africa? That is precisely what Beijing has been working on, and it has had more than a few successes alreadyâ€”though it is far too early to render any definitive judgment.At the same time, moreover, Chinese leaders have been working assiduously to â€œrebalanceâ€? the Chinese economy toward services and away from polluting heavy manufacturing. This seems to be working slowly, as exports now make up less than 20 percent of Chinese GDP, compared with some 36 percent a decade ago. These broader trends suggest that Beijing will not cave quickly to American demands on trade. China's economy could even arguably benefit from a trade war as it would only accelerate the trends toward services, diversification of supply and demand, as well as reliance on domestic consumption. It must also be said that as an authoritarian polity with large cash reserves and a reputation for moving money around efficiently to needy sectors, Beijing is reasonably well placed to weather a near-term financial crisis.In this lose-lose scenario, Americans will also feel painâ€”and not just in their prized stock portfolios . As is well-known, U.S. farmers are already reeling from instability in commodity markets set off by the threats and counter-threats over the last few months. These same farmers had experienced good times over the last decade as Chinaâ€™s demand growth proved exponential. Now, farmers all over the worldâ€”and outside the United Statesâ€”will be working overtime to eat up Americans' previous market share. This especially includes farmers in Latin America and the former Soviet Union. Also, numerous leading American companies, from Apple to Starbucks, to Boeing to Caterpillar, will be injured by damaged bilateral trade ties, while their competitorsâ€”e.g., Europeâ€™s Airbusâ€”will enjoy privileged access.But perhaps Washington is also in a strong position, as suggested in an analysis by the New York Times recently. And maybe the unfortunate byproduct of Chinaâ€™s rapid growth over the last decades has been a hollowing out of U.S. manufacturing. Therefore, some reform to the complicated economic relationship was bound to occur, sooner or later. Could it be that the stock indexes have already priced in the painful readjustment as the two economies are wrenched apart? There is not much hope that this trade war will lead to any positive conclusion, for either country.Bear in mind, of course, that the architects of this perilous approach have no experience in fighting a successful trade war. Thus, we are witnessing a grand experiment. On that point, the American â€œasksâ€? appear to be startlingly far-fetched: that Beijing ceases its support for leading industrial sectors (such as the Made in China 2025 plan) and that it halts its long-time practice of insisting that foreign companies share technology and adopt Chinese partners. Reputable Chinese financial analysts are thus predicting that Beijing will not accept Washingtonâ€™s requirements. This may be due, in part, to the fact that â€œU.S. demands seem to keep evolving [??????????].â€?Even in the unlikely circumstances that Chinese leaders were to cave on these points, what are the chances that they would be implemented satisfactorily and sustainably? Regarding the demand that China must stop asking for access to new technologies, U.S. media pundits seem to forget that American companies have had a choice about whether to do business in China and these corporate leaders are neither stupid, nor irresponsible, nor unpatriotic people. To the contrary, they have most likely concluded that technological seepage is either not particularly significant, or that this seepage is inevitable. In either case, U.S. companies have elected to go along, and these calculations were most likely rational, following a simple cost-benefit calculation that is unlikely to change in its fundamentals because of a trade war. For all the allegations of stolen technological secrets, moreover, there appear to be few concrete examples. That is certainly true in the national-security realm, where speculation has run rampant for decades in the absence of much real evidence, and more than a few episodes of absolute hokum . Moreover, the American media seems utterly oblivious to the historical fact that the U.S. economic rise in the nineteenth century was also to some extent built on stolen technology and rampant corruption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"â€œThe rich man glories in his riches, because he feels that they naturally draw upon him the attention of the world....At the thought of this, his heart seems to swell and dilate itself within him, and he is fonder of his wealth, upon this account, than for all the other advantages it procures him.â€? â€” Adam Smith, Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759)In certain obvious respects, the Trump presidency reaffirms long-hardening polarities of class warfare in the United States. Accordingly, Americaâ€™s glibly Edenic myth of â€œequalityâ€? has continued to unravel before the relentless economic assaults of this provocative presidency. At the same time, because these grievous assaults are potentially ruinous for the rich as well as the poor â€”especially when they take their current form of irrational trade warsâ€”the net effect could include a more generally injurious leavening of American well-being.In other words, the disjointed Trump tariff policies and policy correlates will be â€œegalitarianâ€? in the sum total of their inflicted harms, but this egalitarianism will also mean that rich and poor must somehow â€œshareâ€? in the inevitable suffering.For both scholars and policymakers, such an evident irony should bring to mind Adam Smith and his Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Long ago, Smith had already understood the manifestly complex nuances of international trade, and was quick to point out that trade policy outcomes were often unexpected and markedly counterintuitive. Published in 1776, â€œthe Wealth of Nationsâ€? was indeed a revolutionary book; yet, quite conspicuously and purposefully, it did not expressly favor the monetary or social interests of any one particular economic/social class over another.For the most part, Adam Smith sought an optimal market of goods and services that would suitably promote the wealth of all competing classes, simultaneously.Understandably, what he did not seek, above all, was a system of production and exchange that could quickly become corrosive and deleterious â€œacross the board.â€? In this connection, he had expressly highlighted the numerous prospective errors of any baseless protectionist strategies, most notably any unilateral imposition of tariffs that could plausibly be reciprocated. Famously, in such classical assessments, Smith had identified an â€œinvisible hand,â€? in essence, a foreseeable â€œconvergence of satisfactionsâ€? whereby the unstoppable compulsions of individual self-interest and the equally insistent needs of entire nations could somehow be reconciled.But what might this seemingly quaint eighteenth-century stance have to do with our present and increasingly uncertain American economic moment? To begin a proper answer, the commendably seamless arguments of Adam Smith remain a reflexive mainstay of modern political conservatives. Never a plutocrat, Smith reasoned persuasively that various arrangements of private wealth maximization could still permit the poor to live tolerably. Rejecting his contemporary Jean Jacques Rousseauâ€™s very contrary position â€”that is, that â€œthe privileged few . . . gorge themselves with superfluities, while the starving multitude are in want of the bare necessities of lifeâ€?â€”he foresaw in capitalism not just an enviably rising productivity, but also the indispensable foundations for ensuing political liberty.Later, of course, Karl Marx offered a distinctly alternate view. Marx, for his part, had seen in these virtually identical and allegedly harmonious dynamics of economic competition a veritable font of personal and collective self-destruction. Moreover, it was, for him, a deeply regrettable and execrable font.There is more. In his own time, Adam Smith was undaunted by any determinedly specious political arguments that were grievously detached from intellect. By applying various capitalistic modes of production and exchange, he had reasoned, an inextinguishable social inequality might still be cheerfully reconciled with certain measurable increments of human progress. In those troubling cases where the prevailing facts could have taken him in different directions, we may presently assume, he would have felt compelled to make aptly reciprocal modifications of his core theories.Most assuredly, among Donald Trumpâ€™s most senior economic advisors, there is no Adam Smith. Indeed, enchanted by conceptual simplifications, which always appeal to â€œthe base,â€? self-declared supporters of Adam Smith wittingly ignore the admirable depth and complexity of his conceptual thought. For example, they disregard that Smithâ€™s presumed system of â€œperfect libertyâ€? can never be consistent with robust encouragements of an endlessly needless consumption.Adam Smith had understood what Trump trade policies disregard: certain inexorable laws of the marketplace, driven by a natural competition, always demand principled disdain for vanity-driven consumption.Adam Smith could never have abided â€œconspicuous consumption,â€? a phrase that would later be used more popularly and more effectively by sociologist Thorsten Veblen. This particular species of consumption, driven in the final analysis by variously recalcitrant cravings related to individual self-worth, could never expect to become a rational engine for economic or social improvement. Today, this still crucial point should resonate instructively with all who would heap gratuitous praise upon a White House that blatantly equates personal success with the conspicuous envy of mostly anonymous others.In any event, under no imaginable circumstances could Adam Smith have championed a system of consumption premised on the notion that material acquisition ought to stem originally from the prior wish to impress other people.Significantly, although Adam Smith already understood both the psychological and economic dynamics of â€œconspicuous consumption,â€? he also loathed and feared such dynamics. For him, it was reasonable that the market should routinely regulate the price and quantity of available goods according to the unchanging and â€œnaturalâ€? arbiters of public demand. This market, he urged accordingly, must never be manipulated from above, by governments, especially by way of deceptively foolish policies that must create indeterminate tariffs and potentially cascading trade wars.Under President Donald Trump, America is rapidly losing sight of Adam Smithâ€™s â€œnatural liberty.â€? In vain, this president still attempts to construct a viable economic policy upon overflowing oceans of shallow slogans and empty witticisms. Arguably, our correlative or derivative problems of orchestrated trade barriers and manipulated hyper-consumption are not primarily economic. Rather, Smith would have warned, spurred on by ineradicable personal doubts of self-worth and self-esteem, these problems should be examined as fundamentally psychological in origin.Ironically, while the Trump administration remains committed to policies that are ritually oriented toward â€œbuying more,â€? the tangible effects of its needlessly combative trade policies will have a decidedly opposite set of outcomes. It follows that these tariff-centered policies, supporting retrograde attitudes toward â€œconspicuous consumptionâ€? and price inflation at the same time, must represent the absolute worst of all currently possible policy options.Whether Democrats or Republicans, all Americans already believe, more or less directly, that their national economic efforts must somehow be oriented toward status-based purchasing. Oddly enough, however, disregarding Adam Smith, almost no one seeks to inquire: â€œWhat sort of society can we ultimately expect from such an economic system that is based upon feverish social imitation and absolutely endless conformance?â€?Writing in the middle of the nineteenth century, the American Transcendentalist philosopher, Ralph Waldo Emerson, had remarked presciently on â€œself-reliance.â€? Any foolish â€œreliance upon property,â€? Emerson warned, is the predictable result of a 'want of self-reliance.' What suitable corrective was needed? Emerson had answered succinctly, and without discernible hesitation: 'High thinking and plain living.'Nonetheless, the relentlessly conformist call of American mass society still remains loud, crass and seemingly persuasive, especially under the aegis of a president making systematic war upon intellect, education and all serious elements of learning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US President Donald Trump meets with Canadaâ€™s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a bilateral meeting at the G7 Summit in in Charlevoix, Quebec, Canada, Friday. Leah Millis, ReutersQUEBEC CITY - In the end, the long charm offensive by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to avoid the ire of US President Donald Trump failed just hours after success seemed closest, with Trump raining insults as Trudeau closed what seemed like a triumphant global summit.Besides the escalated risk of a trade war, Trump's blistering personal attack on Trudeau poses domestic economic and political risks for the Canadian prime minister, who has stuck to a conciliatory stance in the face of US threats on NAFTA and other bilateral trade cases.'PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, 'US Tariffs were kind of insulting' and he 'will not be pushed around.' Very dishonest & weak,' Trump tweeted as he flew to a Singapore summit on North Korea.The attack shattered any hope that Canada could avoid US tariffs on steel and aluminum or renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement by virtue of the charm, patience or measured response it has extended to Trump since he took office.Trudeau's office, reeling from the abrupt Trump reversal hours after the 2 men had joked and smiled their way through a fractious G7 meeting, said only that Trudeau had said nothing in his news conference that he hadn't said before.'Canadians are polite, we're reasonable, but we also will not be pushed around,' Trudeau had told reporters as he reiterated that Canada would retaliate against US tariffs on steel and aluminum, adding Trump's rationale had been insulting.While the 2 men have had several seemingly congenial meetings and phone calls since Trump took office, they could not be more different in terms of policy, with Trudeau a progressive liberal, outspoken on feminism and the merits of diversity and who was close to former president Barack Obama.Earlier in the day, Trudeau had sniped about Trump's late appearance at a women's empowerment breakfast, referring to 'stragglers'.Trump's about-face sparked dismay and anger among Canadian and American free trade advocates alike.'To our allies: bipartisan majorities of Americans remain pro-free trade, pro-globalization & supportive of alliances based on 70 years of shared values. Americans stand with you, even if our president doesnâ€™t,' US Republican Senator John McCain tweeted after Trump on Saturday.Trudeau's former foreign policy adviser, Roland Paris lashed out at the US president.'Big tough guy once he's back on his airplane. Can't do it in person, and knows it, which makes him feel weak. So he projects these feelings onto Trudeau and then lashes out at him,' Paris tweeted.Trade experts who have watched Trump negotiate with tough words on Twitter before said the bark of Trump's tweets often exceeds the bite of his policy - but that this time, Canada might struggle to respond.'The rhetoric has far outpaced the implementation,' said Geoffrey Gertz, trade analyst with Brookings think tank in Washington. 'Now we might be at a turning point ... (Canadians are) a little bit at a loss right now to figure out what to do.'But while Trudeau's months-long effort to reach out to US politicians and business leaders at every jurisdiction and level may not have won over Trump, it may pay dividends if Trump's attack finally spurs support from business groups or Congress.Republicans worry the dispute with Canada could become an issue in trade-dependent farm states ahead of November congressional elections.'There's some movement within Congress now to rein in Trump on trade policy,' Gertz said.During the summit, Trump had changed the photo on his Twitter page to the 'family photo' taken with other G7 leaders.

Jason Lee, ReutersBEIJING/WASHINGTON -- US tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports took effect as a deadline passed on Friday, and with Beijing having vowed to respond immediately in kind, the two biggest economies were set on a risky path toward a full-blown trade war.Earlier on Friday, before the 0401 GMT deadline (12:01 p.m. in Manila) for tariffs was set to take effect, China's state media lashed out at US President Donald Trump, accusing the White House of behaving like a 'gang of hoodlums' as the world's two biggest economies headed towards outright trade war on Friday.On Thursday, Trump warned that the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, or roughly the total amount that the United States imported from China last year.Beijing has vowed to respond immediately with an equal amount of tariffs of its own against US autos, agricultural and other products.Chinese shares, which have been battered in the run-up to the tariff deadline, slipped further from early deals and pulled Asian markets down, while the yuan currency also weakened.'In effect, the Trump administration is behaving like a gang of hoodlums with its shakedown of other countries, particularly China,' the state-run China Daily newspaper said in an English language editorial on Friday.'Its unruliness looks set to have a profoundly damaging impact on the global economic landscape in the coming decades, unless countries stand together to oppose it.'While the initial volley of tariffs was not expected to have major immediate economic impact, the fear is that a prolonged battle would disrupt makers and importers of affected goods in a blow to global trade, investment and growth.'For companies with supply exposure to tariffs, they will move sourcing country of origin if they can; if they can't, they'll pass on as much of the tariff cost as they can, or see a cut in margins,' said Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council in Beijing.'Companies donâ€™t know how big this may get, or how it will end.'On Thursday, Ford Motor Co said that for now, it would not hike prices of imported Ford and higher-margin luxury Lincoln models in China.A China central bank adviser said the planned US import tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods - $34 billion plus a planned follow-on list worth $16 billion - will cut China's economic growth by 0.2 percentage points, although the overall impact would be limited, the official Xinhua news agency reported Friday.China's foreign minister said trade protectionism and unilateral actions were 'short-sighted' and in a statement on Friday called on European counties to work with China to safeguard a globally free trade system.On Thursday, China accused the United States of 'opening fire' on the world with its raft of tariffs aimed at China, as well as at trade partners in North America and Europe.The dispute has roiled financial markets including stocks, currencies and the global trade of commodities from soybeans to coal in recent weeks. US stocks edged higher on Thursday, however, amid hopes that American trade tensions with Europe may ease after comments from German Chancellor Angela Merkel.'This is not economic Armageddon. We will not have to hunt our food with pointy sticks. But it is applying the brakes to a global economy that has less durable momentum than appears to be the case,' Rob Carnell, chief economist at ING, said in a note to clients.NO SIGN OF LAST-MINUTE TALKSThere was no evidence of last-minute negotiations between US and Chinese officials, business sources in Washington and Beijing said.Beijing has said it will not 'fire the first shot' in a trade war with the United States, but has made clear that Chinese tariffs on American goods would take effect immediately after US duties on Chinese goods are put in place.US Customs and Border Protection officials are due to collect 25 percent duties on a range of products including motor vehicles, computer disk drives, parts of pumps, valves and printers and many other industrial components.The list avoids direct tariffs on consumer goods such as cellphones and footwear. But some products, including thermostats, are lumped into intermediate and capital goods categories.Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said on Thursday that the proposed US tariffs would hit many American and foreign companies operating in China and disrupt their supplies of components and assembly work.Foreign companies accounted for $20 billion, or 59 percent, of the $34 billion of exports from China that would be subject to new US tariffs, with US firms accounting for a significant part of that 59 percent, Gao said.China has said it would respond with tariffs on hundreds of US goods, including top exports such as soybeans, sorghum and cotton, threatening US farmers in states that backed Trump in the 2016 US election, such as Texas and Iowa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"North Korea has so far suspended its missile and nuclear tests, shut down its nuclear test site and dismantled parts of key facilities at its main rocket launch site. Trump at first lauded the results of the meeting and praised Kim, but last week he cancelled Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visit to the North, citing insufficient progress with denuclearization - blaming China for hindering the process.Since the landmark summit between the US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, where they agreed to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, bilateral relations have swung back and forth.'The special envoys will have extensive discussions with their North Korean counterparts, covering a concrete schedule for the upcoming inter-Korean summit and the development of inter-Korean relations as well as denuclearization and the settlement of peace on the Korean Peninsula', the statement said. They note that the end of war declaration could allow the North to call for the signing of a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War and the pullout of 28,500 USA troops deployed in South Korea.Since then relations have cooled and a planned visit by the top USA diplomat to North Korea was scrapped last week because Trump said insufficient progress toward denuclearization had been made.'I've had a good relationship with Kim Jong Un and I'm not saying it won't change', Mr Trump said in the interview. 'If he does, they will be bigger than before'. 'Their relationship and bond remain strong'.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying said the remarks regarding China's role on the North Korea issue were 'irresponsible'.'We hope the U.S. can play a positive and constructive role in settling the issue just like the Chinese'.Mr Trump caught many American military planners off guard when he announced after a summit with Mr Kim on June 12 that the United States was suspending this summer's joint military drills with South Korea.'Trump feels strongly that North Korea is under tremendous pressure from China because of our major trade disputes with the Chinese Government', the tweet read.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Walmart, the biggest US retailer, warned the Trump administration the newest round of tariffs on imported Chinese goods could prompt it to raise prices on products from shampoo to bicycles to food. 'The immediate impact will be to raise prices on consumers and tax American business and manufacturers'.Next week, the United States will place a ten-percent tariff on 200 billion dollars worth of goods from China. That penalty will rise to 25 percent beginning January 1.According to reports, China could lower the tariffs as early as next month.Walmart said the tariff would impact prices of everything from food products to beverages and personal care items. 'Furthermore, none of these items are related to intellectual property or trade secrets and it is hard to see how taxing these goods will resolve these more complex trade challenges'.Chinese billionaire and Alibaba founder Jack Ma said a pledge to create 1 million new jobs in the United States won't happen, thanks to President Donald Trump's tough stance on trade with Beijing.Beijing is reportedly looking at lowering import tariffs on global trading partners, which could include the U.S.The trade war has started to hit Chinese cities and provinces, especially those that depend on US order books.Walmart confirmed it sent the letter and in a statement to Reuters urged the two countries to find solutions.While the direct economic impact of the dispute on China has so far been limited, the trade tensions could rapidly push Chinese exporters to switch away from the USA market, a former chief of China's central bank said on Wednesday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Steely resolve.One week ago, Donald Trump announced that he would be slapping hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the United States. He did not specify whether these duties would apply to imports from all foreign countries without exception. And his administration was unable to clarify this point because the president publicized the policy before heâ€™d given the White House staff, government lawyers â€” or officials at the departments of State, Treasury, or Defense â€” an opportunity to weigh in on the measure, or hammer out its details.For days, all Americaâ€™s allies had to go on were Trump tweets; and those did not evince an appetite for accommodation. As administration officials worked to rebut the idea that the presidentâ€™s tariffs would spark a trade war, Trump cheered one on â€” observing that â€œtrade wars are good, and easy to win.â€?But on Thursday, the president finally gave the world clarity. During a signing ceremony in the Roosevelt Room, the president explained that:â€¢ The United States will impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports, and a 10 percent one on aluminum imports, in 15 days â€” or in no sooner than 15 days, anyway.â€¢ Canada and Mexico will be indefinitely exempted from these tariffs â€” unless they refuse to concede to his administrationâ€™s (radical) demands in NAFTA negotiations.â€¢ Americaâ€™s other core allies can â€œnegotiateâ€? for an exemption from the tariffs. And the U.S. will give special consideration to its â€œgreat partnersâ€? and â€œgreat military alliesâ€? â€” but also, â€œmany of the countries that treat us the worst on trade and on military are our â€˜alliesâ€™ as they like to call them.â€?â€¢ China has been â€œvery helpfulâ€? on geopolitical matters, but the United States will nonetheless enact â€œreciprocal tariffsâ€? on Chinese imports in the near future, even if that means slapping a â€œ50 percentâ€? tariff on some Chinese products.This cacophony of contradictions reflected divisions within Trumpâ€™s administration and, by all appearances, his own mind.Throughout Wednesday night and early Thursday morning, White House aides whispered to reporters that unresolved â€œdebates and complicationsâ€? might force the signing ceremony to be postponed. But, just as he had one week earlier, the president forced his administration to take a â€œfake it â€™till you make itâ€? approach to global economic policy, by unilaterally tweeting a confirmation of the event.Looking forward to 3:30 P.M. meeting today at the White House. We have to protect & build our Steel and Aluminum Industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends and treat us fairly on both trade and the military. â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 8, 2018Nonetheless, judging by the stock marketâ€™s response, the consensus interpretation of Trumpâ€™s performance is that he has just revealed his â€œtrade warâ€? to be of the Potemkin variety.The presidentâ€™s remarks brimmed with populist flourishes â€” lamentations of factories â€œleft to rot and rust,â€? and â€œthriving communitiesâ€? transformed into â€œghost towns,â€? along with condemnations of â€œthe politiciansâ€? who â€œnever did anything about it.â€? And Trump repeatedly claimed that Americaâ€™s trade partners were robbing the country of $800 billion on an annual basis, and that it would be worth slapping â€œ75 percentâ€? tariffs on some nationâ€™s imports to combat this menace.But he also subtly suggested that these statements were motivated less by substantive commitment than domestic political concerns. He framed the signing ceremony as the fulfillment of a campaign promise, and mused that his â€œmessageâ€? about trade was one of the primary reasons he won the presidency.Most critically, in between all that populist bluster, the president did indefinitely, and completely, exempt two of the top four exporters of steel to the U.S. from tariffs â€” a concession that renders the policy decidedly more modest than it appeared to be a week ago.There is still some ambiguity about how all this well play out. While the European Union will have an opportunity to push for an exemption to the tariffs, Trump has put one of his administrationâ€™s nationalist hardliners â€” trade representative Robert Lighthizer â€” in charge of arbitrating such requests. Nonetheless, even in the most pessimistic reading, Trump appears to be scaling back his ambitions from â€œwin a global trade warâ€? to â€œextort some policy concessions and/or Mar-a-Lago membershipsâ€? from core allies in exchange for tariff relief.â€? Which is to say: He appears to be less interested in pursuing protectionism than a protection racket.And, given that the presidentâ€™s rhetoric over the past week â€” and Gary Cohnâ€™s sudden resignation â€” Wall Street seems to regard this development as good news.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US President Donald Trump on Thursday slapped deeply contentious trade tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, swatting aside warnings of a global trade war and protests from allies in Europe and at home.The tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum will come into effect in 15 days, the White House said.They will not apply to Canada and Mexico initially, an official said, adding that security and trade partners could negotiate to seek exemption.The measures are likely to spark retaliatory sanctions from the European Union, China and other economic powers.Moving to fulfil a protectionist campaign promise, Trump leaned on a little-used national security clause in US trade law.â€œThis is a promise made, a promise kept,â€? a senior administration official said, â€œno one should be surprised.â€?The metals are used in everything from cars to construction, roads to railways. Economists estimate billions of dollars of trade will be affected.Hours before the signing, Trump told his cabinet that these products were the â€œbackbone of our nation, they are the bedrock of defense industrial base.â€?The mercurial 45th president compared his action to those of predecessors George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and William McKinley.â€œOur greatest presidentsâ€? he said, â€œthey protected our country from outside influence, from other countries coming in and stealing our wealth and stealing our jobs and stealing our companies.â€?More than 50 percent of steel and aluminum exports come from allies in the European Union, Canada, Japan, and South Korea. But countries from Brazil to South Africa are likely to be affected.Trump said he would be flexible toward â€œreal friends,â€? touting an exemption for Canada and Mexico as they renegotiate a trade deal with Washington.If an agreement on NAFTA is reached, he said, â€œit is most likely that we wonâ€™t be charging those two countries the tariffs.â€?Trump added Australia to a list of likely carve-outs, and indicated that other trade and military allies could be exempted.â€œWe have a very close relationship with Australia,â€? he said. â€œWe have a trade surplus with Australia, great country, long term partner, weâ€™ll be doing something with them.â€?But he singled out Germany for criticism, reviving a longstanding gripe that European NATO allies do not pay their fair share.â€œWe have some friends and some enemies where we have been tremendously taken advantage of over the years on trade and on military,â€? he said.â€œIf you look at NATO, where Germany pays one percent and we are paying 4.2 percent of a much bigger GDP â€” thatâ€™s not fair.â€?â€“ Partners promise backlash â€“Last week Trump stunned the world â€” and his own aides â€” with an off-the-cuff announcement of his tariff plan, before White House lawyers judged the legality of the move and before it was clear which countries would be targeted.He cited Chinese overproduction and national security concerns as the main driver.Since then, the White House has scrambled to catch up, Trumpâ€™s top economic advisor Gary Cohn â€” who opposed the move â€” quit in protest and stock markets have sunk.â€œHe may be globalist, but I still like him,â€? Trump joked on Thursday, alluding to an ideological clash within his administration that the â€œnationalistsâ€? appear to have decisively won.As Trump approved the tariffs, 11 partners in the Asia-Pacific were in Santiago, Chile, to sign a multilateral trade deal embraced by president Barack Obama but rejected by Trump.While economic fallout from Trumpâ€™s tariffs remains unclear, the political fallout has been swift.More than 100 Republican lawmakers have signed a letter to Trump expressing â€œdeep concernâ€? about the policy, which they warned could â€œundermineâ€? economic gains from the presidentâ€™s own tax reforms.The European Union, China and Brazil have all warned they will retaliate, with the decision threatening to sour already vinegared trans-Atlantic relations.The European Union has promised tariffs on items from steel to peanut butter, bourbon and denim â€” most of which are produced in states that Trump needs to win reelection.â€œTrade wars are bad and easy to lose,â€? EU President Donald Tusk warned, rejecting Trumpâ€™s assertion they were â€œgood and easy to winâ€?.Data released Wednesday showed the US foreign trade deficit widened in January to its highest level in nine years â€” heaping pressure on Trump, who had campaigned on a promise to reverse that trend.Trump blamed the situation on his White House predecessors, while also taking aim at Beijing over the size of its trade deficit with the United States.China meanwhile warned Thursday it was ready to respond to US tariffs if they materialize.â€œChoosing a trade war is surely the wrong prescription, in the end you will only hurt others and yourself,â€? Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, adding that â€œChina will certainly make an appropriate and necessary response.â€?AFP.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"by Tyler DurdenZeroHedge.comThu, 03/22/2018Picking up where the WSJ left off yesterday, Reuters reports that China is preparing a range of responses to the just announced $50BN in U.S. tariffs and will â€œstand up to protectionismâ€?, but that it still hopes for dialogue, according to Beijingâ€™s WTO ambassador, Zhang Xiangchen.As a reminder, yesterday the WSJ reported that China is preparing to hit back with its own countertariff aimed at President Donald Trumpâ€™s support base, including levies targeting U.S. agricultural exports from farmbelt states in retaliation to the mounting trade offensive from Washington.â€œAny Chinese response to new U.S. tariffs would be measured and proportional,â€? said a Chinese official involved in policy-making. Specifically, China is said to target U.S. exports of soybeans, sorghum and live hogs.However, as a first step Reuters notes that Zhang Xiangchen said China was considering a WTO complaint against the package of tariffs that President Donald Trump is expected to announce later on Thursday.â€œThis is a legitimate right for China to do that. But I would not exclude other options, because if the flood approaches you have to bank up to keep it out,â€? he told Reuters.Meanwhile, as Trump just said moments ago, Thursdayâ€™s tariff announcement is the first in a string of U.S. trade restrictions aimed squarely at China and intended to curb alleged theft of U.S. technology. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday the tariffs would target Chinaâ€™s high-technology sector and could also include restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States. Other sectors like apparel could also be hit: full details are set to emerge over the next 2 weeks.And while we wait for the details, the imminent question is what China will do next.To answer this question, Deutsche Bank has laid out several possible scenarios of how China will retaliate to the Trump tariffs.As the German lender notes, Europe has already outlined the limited actions it would take in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, targeting areas of US imports that may be politically important to key congressmen (bourbon from Kentucky, motorcycles from Wisconsin, and so on). It notes that if these actions do not spiral upward, their overall magnitude is likely too small to have significant macroeconomic implications.Digging into the specifics, here are the details from Deutsche on every possible scenario:Baseline: Under the baseline, we expect China would actively negotiate with the US to avoid an escalation of trade frictions. The US administration has reportedly asked China to reduce the bilateral trade deficit by $100bn. It is not clear what the time horizon for this goal is, though the number itself is too large to be achieved in a short time period (and definitely not before the US mid-term election).China nonetheless would be willing to offer to import more from the US in products such as automobiles, airplanes, and natural gas. China already announced that it will cut tariffs for automobiles and â€œsome consumer goods.â€?The Restâ€¦HERE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CHINA and the US remain on the brink of a Â£75billion trade war with catastrophic economic implications after Beijing issued a tough warning to President Donald Trump over his threat of huge American tariffs.By REBECCA PERRINGExpress.co.ukMon, Jun 4, 2018Beijing quickly warned Washington that it could not commit to buying more American goods after a third round of trade talks between the worldâ€™s two biggest economies failed to deliver a breakthrough.The stalemate comes after Mr Trump said he would move to implement $50billion (Â£38billion) tariffs on Chinese industrial exports â€œshortlyâ€? after June 15.US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross and vice premier Liu He did not issue a joint statement after they wrapped up two days of discussions.But in a statement released on behalf of the Chinese government by the official news agency, Xinhua, China said economic sanctions on its exports would derail negotiations.The Chinese statement said: â€œAgreements between China and the United States should be based on the premise of both sides moving in the same direction and not waging a trade war.â€œIf the US launches trade sanction measures, including the imposition of tariffs, then all the economic and trade benefits negotiated by both sides are not going to take effect.â€?The US and China held a previous round of talks in May, where Chinese officials said they would â€œsubstantiallyâ€? reduce their countryâ€™s trade surplus with America.Last week, President Donald Trump announced 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, despite previous exemptions.The Restâ€¦HERE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DONALD TRUMP called Jean-Claude Juncker a â€œbrutal killerâ€? at the recent G7 summit in Canada, according to the European Union chief as he opened up about the blocâ€™s strained relationship with the US.By JOE BARNES, BRUSSELS CORRESPONDENTExpress.co.ukFri, Jun 15, 2018Relations between Brussels and Washington have been strained since the US President chose to refuse the EUâ€™s exemption request for his steel and aluminium tariffs.The worldwide tariffs were a one of the hot discussion points between the worldâ€™s most powerful leaders as they gathered at the summit in Quebec.Mr Trump set off political fireworks when he lashed out at Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau after he announced G7 leaders had finalised a joint statement on the difficult trade situation.Describing an encounter between himself and the US President, Mr Juncker said: â€œTrump told me last week â€˜you are a brutal killerâ€™.â€œThatâ€™s the first time that Luxembourg has grown into such a threat to the US.â€œI think he meant it as a compliment, but Iâ€™â€™m not so sure.â€?The EUâ€™s most senior official revealed the insult as he addressed the Bavarian regional parliament in Germany.Mr Juncker added the EUâ€™s turbulent relationship with the US over trade has grown â€œsadâ€? and reaffirmed the blocâ€™s willingness to strike back in a trade war.He said: â€œThe trade problem that we have with the US is sad.â€œWe canâ€™t let the tariffs on steel and aluminium by the American administration go answered.â€?The Restâ€¦HERE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by Tyler DurdenZeroHedge.comWed, 07/04/2018Two weeks after Daimler AG became the first German car company to cut its earnings forecasts due to trade war concerns (an implicit warning that already despondent European economic data still has room to worsen), German Chancellor Angela Merkel has ratcheted up her doomsaying rhetoric, invoking the memory of the global financial crisis in a warning about the potential fallout should the US continue to press its trade war with China, Europe and the rest of the world.According to Bloomberg, Merkel warned during a speech before Germanyâ€™s lower house of Parliament that the levies on European car makers threatened by President Trump and the Commerce Department could potentially be â€œmuch more seriousâ€? than the USâ€™s tariffs on steel and aluminum. Instead, Merkel argued that economic cooperation is far more effective at bolstering economic growth, as the response to the global financial crisis (when the worldâ€™s largest central banks worked in concert to pump some $14 trillion into the global financial system) demonstrated.And in what sounded like a bit of denial about the current state of things, Merkel warned that the US must prevent the â€œtrade conflictâ€? with China from blossoming into an all-out â€œtrade war,â€? according to the AFP (as if that hasnâ€™t already happened).â€œThe international financial crisis, which ensured that we now act in the framework of the G-20, would never have been resolved so quickly, despite the pain, if we hadnâ€™t cooperated in a multilateral fashion in the spirit of comradeship,â€? Merkel said on Wednesday. â€œThis has to happen.â€?[â€¦]â€œItâ€™s worth every effort to try to defuse this conflict so it doesnâ€™t turn into a war,â€? she said. â€œBut of course it takes two sides to do that.â€?President Trumpâ€™s complaints about US trade deficits are overblown, Merkel argued. If services are factored in, the US actually has a trade surplus with the EU.â€œIf you include services like the digital services, then you have a completely different trade balance sheet with the US showing a surplus against the EU,â€? she noted.â€œIt is almost old-fashioned to only calculate goods and not include services,â€?

"The White House and Beijing may be escalating an increasingly hostile trade war with harsh words and cascading waves of tariffs, but thereâ€™s one battlefield where the Chinese arenâ€™t fighting back: Washington.U.S. and European companies have been in an all-out sprint to hire lobbyists to battle for global free trade ever since President Donald Trump started tearing up treaties and slapping penalties on imports from furniture to auto parts. But even though Chinese firms stand to lose the most from Trumpâ€™s aggressive moves, only a handful of the very largest â€” such as tech giants ZTE and Huawei â€” have lobbyists on retainer or staff in the U.S.The reason is largely cultural and historical. Many Chinese firms are partly government-owned, and theyâ€™re used to relying on officials in Beijing or their American business partners to fight for their interests. But they could be missing opportunities to their products off Trumpâ€™s growing tariff lists. And advocates for Chinese investment in the U.S., which has plummeted to a seven-year low, fear the silence is just contributing to an increasingly hostile environment.â€œIâ€™ve been frankly trying to persuade Chinese companies to do more lobbying without a whole lot of success,â€? said Bill Black, president of the Greater Washington China Investment Center. â€œSeeing what was on the horizon, I had tried to convince them to work with local American communities to advocate for a more open and friendly approach to investment.â€?Siva Yam, president of the United States of America-China Chamber of Commerce, a nonprofit that represents U.S. and Chinese companies, said business culture in China and internationally is â€œcontrolled and led by the Chinese government,â€? and Chinese companies are therefore less inclined to 'openly doing lobbying.'But meanwhile, with trade talks between the U.S and China at an impasse, Trumpâ€™s penalties are slamming Chinese exporters more than any others. Trump imposed steel and aluminum tariffs in March on a range of countries including China, and then this month slapped duties on an additional $34 billion in Chinese goods on the grounds that the move would protect U.S. technology. Tariffs on another $16 billion of Chinese goods are likely to be imposed soon. And on July 10, his administration said it would move toward taxing an additional $200 billion in Chinese products ranging from handbags to toilet paper.Beijing is fighting back with penalties on U.S. goods. But instead of encouraging its own companies to join the fight in Washington, Chinese officials have turned to what may be an outdated playbook: urging U.S. firms that do business in China to lobby the Trump administration. That worked in the past, but itâ€™s not going to pay off the way it once did, said Stewart Baker, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson who works on international trade.Baker said that despite U.S. companiesâ€™ hopes for economic expansion in China, Beijing has made it clear that it intends to create a domestic industry to replace U.S. companies in areas where U.S. firms have an advantage.â€œChina for a generation didnâ€™t have to do much lobbying over these issues because big U.S. companies that believed they had an immense opportunity in China would do their lobbying for them,' Baker said. â€œBut those days are gone because China has basically persuaded all of those big companies that they donâ€™t have a great future in China.'So far, itâ€™s been largely left to U.S. manufacturers to convince the Trump administration that penalties on materials they need will create hardships. After the president says he wants to impose penalties, companies have a chance to head them off because administrative agencies must gather public feedback before putting them into effect. Then, thereâ€™s also a process in which U.S. firms and American subsidiaries of foreign firms can submit requests to have products removed from tariff lists after the fact.U.S. companies and American subsidiaries of foreign firms have filed more than 20,000 requests begging the Commerce Department to exclude certain imports from steel and aluminum tariffs, but only 19 companies have been granted those requests so far exempting steel products from Japan, Sweden, Belgium, Germany and China.But many Chinese companies are unaware that the process exists. Sally Peng, head of the Asia-Pacific practice at the law firm Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg, said she conducted a â€œstraw pollâ€? of the audience at a recent event for a Chinese chamber of commerce to see how many business leaders knew about waivers from the Trump administrationâ€™s steel and aluminum tariffs.â€œNone did,â€? she told POLITICO.Chinese companies havenâ€™t been completely absent from the battle against U.S. tariffs in Washington. In May, a handful of Chinese industry officials testified against some of Trumpâ€™s planned penalties before the United States Trade Representative. They included groups such as the China General Chamber of Commerce-USA and a subsidiary for a Chinese law firm.One company, the U.S. subsidiary of Chinese pharmaceutical company Novast Holdings, was successful in getting birth control removed from the initial list after the head of its U.S. operation warned that it supplied between 10 and 20 percent of the U.S. market and the tariffs could lead to shortages.Chinese companies have opted to take a more indirect approach, even though they are allowed to directly lobby for exemptions from China-specific tariffs.Nicole Bivens Collinson, who leads Sandler, Travis & Rosenbergâ€™s international trade and government relations practice, said some Chinese companies that act as suppliers to U.S. companies have asked their partners to cover the costs of the tariffs, while others have suggested splitting or covering the costs of the tariffs so long as their U.S. counterparts will push to get the tariffs removed.The lack of a Chinese lobbying presence in Washington also could be contributing to a tide of negative opinion thatâ€™s helped push Chinese investment in the U.S. to lows not seen since the great recession. Chinese investment dropped 90 percent in the first half of 2018, compared to the first half of 2017, according to the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. Chinese companies abandoned at least eight major attempted acquisitions worth more than $2.1 billion in the first half of the year because of regulatory scrutiny, Rhodium found.And the trend could get worse. Congress is expected to approve legislation that would give the government broader authority to block foreign investment bids it deems to be harmful to national security.But instead of pushing back, Chinese firms are ceding the territory.The current hostile climate toward China means those companies are unlikely to invest in lobbying efforts any time soon.â€œI think weâ€™re going to go in the opposite direction,â€? said Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington think tank. â€œI think because of the toxicity of the relationship that youâ€™re going to see even less of it going on in the future.â€?Still, the Chinese have found one effective way of influencing Washington policy: going straight to the top.After the Commerce Department imposed a seven-year ban on U.S. firms doing business with telecommunications company ZTE when it was caught violating an agreement regarding sales to Iran and North Korea, Chinese President Xi Jinping asked Trump to intervene. Trump told Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to come up with an alternative punishment for the Chinese company, and the ban was lifted last week.â€œLarge, important companies like ZTE now have a precedent for Xi Jinping to intervene personally and successfully with President Trump, even on a matter as sensitive as Iran sanctions,â€? said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar and China expert at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute think tank. â€œThatâ€™s as good a lobbying option as one can hope for.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trump could be poised to make a deal with Mexico on NAFTA even as he engages in a trade war with the rest of the world.Mexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo arrived in Washington on Wednesday â€” as he has every week for the past month â€” to hammer out some of the most contentious issues on NAFTA.

That would placate Republicans who have been calling for a return to stability as the U.S. and China have been slapping tariffs on each otherâ€™s exports, roiling international markets and burdening American farmers.â€œWeâ€™re settling in for the long haul with China, so we really need to release the pressure in our backyard,â€? said Dan Ujczo, an international trade lawyer who specializes in Canada-U.S. matters. â€œI think thatâ€™s a driving force for the U.S.â€™ desire to get a deal right now.â€?To be sure, some major controversial issues remain unresolved, including the U.S. proposal to automatically terminate the pact after five years unless all three countries agree to renew it â€” an idea that Canada and Mexico have both rejected outright. And for the time being, at least, Canada still remains on the outside of the current talks.But reaching even a bare-bones agreement on NAFTA before Novemberâ€™s elections would hand a concrete victory to Trump, who would likely point to the revamped pact as a symbol that his strong-arm tactics have worked, industry sources and experts closely following the talks say. It would also allow U.S. trade officials to clear a major task off their agenda and dedicate more time to areas where U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in particular has wanted to focus, primarily trade issues with China.At the same time, Mexican negotiators are also under renewed pressure to get a deal after the country elected a new leader who takes office in December and who badly wants NAFTA to be signed and off his plate before then. Mexico has pointed to Aug. 25 as the date by which it must wrap up at least a preliminary agreement for outgoing President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto to be able to sign the deal before he leaves office.Those domestic politics have put Guajardo in a tough position, as he tries to appease the incoming Mexican administration and quickly wrap up a deal while still standing up firmly against some U.S. proposals that Mexico has repeatedly derided as unworkable.â€œTheyâ€™re under a lot of pressure to just come up with anything, whatever it is,â€? one source close to the talks said, requesting anonymity to speak freely about internal deliberations. â€œWhat Iâ€™ve been hearing from other Mexican parties is that Ildefonso was sort of distraught and frazzled by the fact that heâ€™s being asked to wrap it up, and that of course means making concessions that he wasnâ€™t ready to make. It lowers his negotiating potential.â€?Against that backdrop, sources close to the talks say Mexico appears to be poised to accept large swaths of a U.S. proposal involving the rules that govern North American-produced automobiles and dictate what percentage of each car must be sourced from within a NAFTA country to qualify for reduced duties under the agreement.At the U.S.â€™ urging, Mexico looks likely to agree to an increase in the overall amount of North American-sourced content that must be included in each automobile, and will accept a requirement that a certain percentage of each car must be produced by workers earning at least $16 an hour, sources say. Mexico is also poised to accept mandates that a certain percentage of the steel, aluminum and plastic included in each vehicle is also sourced from a NAFTA country.In exchange, the United States would be prepared to give up a controversial proposal that would have made it easier for American fruit and vegetable growers to make the case that Mexico is selling produce at unfairly low prices when crops are in season in a particular region, two sources with knowledge of the trade-off told POLITICO. The U.S. would also submit to Mexicoâ€™s demand to leave a chapter largely untouched that contains rules on disputes between governments, one of the sources said.'Essentially, there is a deal,' one of the sources said.At the same time, however, other major aspects of the renegotiation remain unfinished. Chief among them is the so-called sunset clause that the U.S. wants, which would end the pact after five years unless the parties opt to continue it. Several sources close to the talks say the sunset clause has hardly been discussed during the latest set of meetings between the U.S. and Mexico, and the two countries still remain on opposite sides.And Canada will need to come to the table for a deal to be finalized. Officials from all three countries have sought to emphasize that the U.S.-Mexico engagement is not a sign of ill will toward Canada but is instead an attempt to work out bilateral issues before bringing Ottawa back into the fold.But negotiators had expected that Washington and Mexico City would have made enough progress by now for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland to have joined the meetings in Washington. The more time that passes, the more likely it is that the strategy to put off a trilateral meeting could backfire, a source close to the talks said.'Yes, thereâ€™s U.S.-Mexico momentum â€” thatâ€™s a positive message and great from Mexicoâ€™s point of view,' the source said. 'But the longer it takes to bring in Canada, the less likely this is going to get done in the short term.'Still, any incremental progress, or even the fact that the U.S. and Mexico are continuing to engage in good-faith negotiations and regular meetings, has offered a signal of some hope to U.S. farmers, consumers and industry groups who have been worn out by months of uncertainty and pummeled by retaliatory tariffs imposed over the past few months.Retailers and business groups are reluctant to throw their support at this point behind a deal that is still unfinished, particularly when a number of proposals that some have termed poison pills remain on the table.But at the same time, â€œI think what all of our members want, what the business industry at large wants, is certainty,â€? said Vanessa Sciarra, a former U.S. trade negotiator who now works as a vice president at the National Foreign Trade Council. â€œAnything that provides for greater clarity on trade relationships, particularly with Mexico and Canada â€¦ would be helpful.â€?Adam Behsudi contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This story is being published for Pros as part of a content partnership with the South China Morning Post. It originally appeared on scmp.com on Sept. 21, 2018.US President Donald Trumpâ€™s strategy is to make the trade war with China â€œunprecedentedly largeâ€? and â€œunbearably painfulâ€? for Beijing, and he will not back down before victory, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon said in an exclusive interview.Bannon said the aim was not just to force China to give up on its â€œunfair trade practicesâ€? â€“ the ultimate goal was to â€œre-industrialise Americaâ€? because manufacturing was the core of a nationâ€™s power.He also took aim at the â€œMade in China 2025â€? plan â€“ an attempt by Beijing to catch up with the West in 10 key technology sectors, saying China was using generous government support to reduce its reliance on the West for future technology.Bannon, who to have helped Trump draw up the trade war plan, said that in the past, tariffs had been limited to imports of between roughly US$10 billion and US$30 billion but the sheer magnitude of the more than US$500 billion in question this time had â€œcaught Beijing off guardâ€?.â€œItâ€™s not just any tariff. Itâ€™s tariffs on a scale and depth that is previously inconceivable in US history,â€? Bannon said.He said Beijing had relied on â€œround after round of talksâ€? to take the momentum out of the US punitive measures, but the delaying tactics would not work.â€œThey always want to have a strategic dialogue to tap things along. They never envisioned that somebody would actually do this.â€?He and Trump were convinced the US would win â€“ and there were signs the Chinese elite were too, with â€œso many senior Chinese officials exhausting all channelsâ€? to move their money out of China and into real estate in San Francisco, Los Angeles and midtown Manhattan.â€œWhy [does there have] to be massive capital controls placed on Chinese money? Otherwise all will flee to midtown Manhattan â€¦ They want to buy real assets in the US. That shows you a dramatic lack of confidence in their own economy.â€?Bannon, who left the Trump administration after a tumultuous seven-month stint, said trade had always been at the top of the campaign strategy â€“ first discussing the idea five years ago with then senator Jeff Sessions, who later become Trumpâ€™s attorney general.â€œThis is where Jeff Sessions and I sat in 2013 as we were trying to imagine what the 2016 presidential election would look like,â€? Bannon said in his â€œBreitbart Embassyâ€? townhouse near the Capitol Building in Washington. â€œWe made trade the top issue, when trade was not even among the top 100 issues of the others.â€?Trump and Bannon have a turbulent and complex relationship. Although Trump fired Bannon in January and criticised him for his involvement in Fire and Fury, journalist Michael Wolffâ€™s book about the 2016 campaign and early days of the administration, the president was back in contact with Bannon in May, according to The Wall Street Journal. Bannon also insisted that he and the president â€œsee eye to eyeâ€? on trade.He said there was little difference within the US political elite â€“ either Democrat or Republican â€“ on the issue of international trade, and in his first meeting with Trump in 2015, both men agreed that the Washington and Wall Street establishment would â€œside with Chinaâ€? in the upcoming trade war.The two decided to change the international trade regime to â€œdramatically reduce [the US] trade deficitâ€? and to re-industrialise America, especially the so-called rust belt states.He said Trump would â€œnever back down in the trade war [with China]â€?, even though the president anticipated the policy would face â€œmassive resistance domestically and internationallyâ€?.He accused â€œWestern elitesâ€? of working with Beijing to make themselves rich. â€œOur factories got shipped out of here. Wall Street made a fortune. The private equity made a fortune. Right now President Trumpâ€™s focus is on stopping it.â€?Apart from imposing the unprecedented tariffs, the Trump administration would use Section 301 of the Trade Act to press China on intellectual property rights and stop Beijing from forcing American companies to transfer their technology to Chinese partners, the former chief strategist said.Section 301 authorises the US president to retaliate against any action that violates an international trade agreement or is unjustified, unreasonable or discriminatory, and that burdens or restricts US commerce.Bannon said Washington should also retain some ability to â€œcut offâ€? some key parts of the supply chain with China when necessary â€“ as it did in the case of Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE.Trump banned sales of American technology to the company in July, almost bankrupting it and putting up to 100,000 highly paid Chinese jobs in danger before lifting the ban.â€œIt is very important to the Chinese audience [to remember] the case of ZTE. The central theme of Made in China 2025 is that the Chinese are trying to get off the supply chain â€“ the component parts of the supply chain â€“ of the West. The Chinese are very vulnerable there. Their government should never allow them to get into a situation with all this aggressiveness in their trade policies.â€?But in the end the trade war and US tariffs were about more than the economy and rebuilding American manufacturing.â€œThe elites and the media are trying to convince you that this inexpiable leaving of the factories and jobs is but a law of physics. The opposite is actually true â€“ it is the human action which did it. It can be reversed and it will be reversed,â€? he said.â€œ[The] tariff is about human dignity and human pride â€¦ Not everyone wants to work for an insurance company.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trump on Thursday imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from the European Union, Canada and Mexico, triggering immediate retaliation from U.S. allies and protests from American businesses and farmers.David J. Lynch, Josh Dawsey and Damian Paletta of The Washington Post had the news:The tariffs â€” 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum â€” take effect at midnight Thursday, marking a major escalation of the trade war between the United States and its top trading partners. Stung by the U.S. action, the allies quickly hit back. The E.U. said it would impose import taxes on politically sensitive items like bourbon from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellâ€™s home state of Kentucky. Mexico said it would levy tariffs on American farm products, while Canada zeroed in on the same metals that Trump had slammed. Capping the extraordinary day, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revealed that he had rejected an ultimatum from Vice President Pence that any new North American trade deal be renewed at five-year intervals. â€œToday is a day when the Trump administration pretty much signaled it is throwing out the rule book on trade,â€? said Rufus Yerxa, head of the National Foreign Trade Council and a former U.S. negotiator. â€œIâ€™ve been dealing with this stuff for four decades and Iâ€™ve never seen anything like this.â€?Jeremy Diamond and Julia Horowitz of CNNMoney.com reported that prices could rise for products Americans buy:Trumpâ€™s decision could raise prices for Americans on a range of everyday products. It could also place the United States in a trade dispute on more than one front. The administration is separately moving ahead with tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump imposed the steel and aluminum penalties under a 1962 law that gives the president broad power to increase or reduce tariffs on goods deemed critical to national security. â€œWe take the view that without a strong economy, you cannot have strong national security,â€? Ross told reporters. Trumpâ€™s announcement lifted American steel and aluminum stocks because those companies stand to benefit from penalties against their foreign competitors. U.S. Steel climbed 3%. But the broader market sank because of trade war fears. The Dow fell about 200 points.Ana Swanson of The New York Times reported that the Trump administration believes imports hurt natural security:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"NewsMade in Canada flags products that are made in Canada, publicly tradedFirst-year computer science student, Tyler Campbell, was busy before arriving at U of O for the first week of classesâ€”but not just with getting back-to-school ready.Over the summer, Campbell created a website that aimed to make it easier for Canadians to support their own businesses. The website, called Made in Canada, acts as a database that lists products from furniture to clothing and fast food. The website includes products with components from Canada, products assembled in Canada, and those that support Canadian labour.Made in Canada was created shortly after Canada imposed tariffs on American goods on July 1, in response to the American government imposing tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel in May.On July 2, Campbell and his family were discussing trade at his uncleâ€™s birthday party. â€œWe kind of had the idea of what we can possibly do to help ourselves and help others find Canadian products,â€? he said. â€œWe figured if weâ€™re learning about it Iâ€™m sure other people want to learn about it, so we may as well provide a resource.â€?Campbell, his dad, and uncle are from Uxbridge, Ont., and work on the database together, compiling information on products and verifying submissions.â€œOur main goal is to really promote thinking about what youâ€™re buying,â€? said Campbell. â€œIf something is publicly traded, or even if itâ€™s American owned and itâ€™s made here.â€?Made in Canada flags products that are made in Canada and clarifies products that are publicly traded.With over 2,200 listings, many of the products on the website come from contributions by fellow Canadians. Clothing, furniture, and B2B products are popular submissions, and the total make up over 500 of the databases posts.Prices on Canadian goods can vary. A full-size mattress manufactured in Toronto from Logan & Cove costs $899, whereas the same size mattress from Casper, an American company, costs $1,075 CAD. A dress from the Canadian company Miik costs $169, and a similar dress from H&M costs $69, which is a Swedish company largely manufactured in South East Asia. Locally grown food can be bought fairly easily and affordably at farmerâ€™s markets, but Canadian clothing tends to be more expensive.â€œItâ€™s just a matter of looking in the right place,â€? said Campbell, noting that cheaper options are often available.â€œIf youâ€™re on a budgetâ€”you donâ€™t have to buy Canadian if you canâ€™tâ€”thatâ€™s relatable for probably everyone here, but even if itâ€™s just buying a different brand of chips, or something, thatâ€™s still a contribution,â€? he said.While the website attempts to avoid politics, Campbell said there is that element to it. â€œWeâ€™re more about supporting Canadian, but if youâ€™re going to be boycotting America anyways weâ€™re happy to help,â€? he said.The initiative has garnered strong support during this time of tense trade relations.Campbell has given at least seven interviews to media outlets, including NPR and The Washington Post. â€œWe didnâ€™t expect to get more than a few thousand hits and here we are with three-quarters of a million,â€? he said. â€œItâ€™s been ridiculous, we never expected anything like that.â€?Moving forward, Made in Canada will continue to compile information on products, with the possibility of a podcast and a grocery list in the future.For more information about Campbellâ€™s initiative, and to view the list of Canadian products, visit www.madeinca.ca.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ADVERTISEMENTEarly this morning, the United States officially imposed a 25 percent tariff on $34 billion worth of Chinese exports. The Chinese government, which didn't want to be seen 'firing the first shot,' says it will immediately impose its own retaliatory tariffs on $34 billion worth of U.S. exports. The Trump administration already has tariffs on another $16 billion of Chinese exports in the works, and is threatening to impose duties on a whopping $500 billion worth if China doesn't back down.In other words, President Trump's trade war is on. And just like an actual war, the start of hostilities begs a question: How do you win?In April, journalist Keith Richburg wrote about how 'at the start of Americaâ€™s disastrous invasion of Iraq, then Major General David Petraeus ... famously asked my Washington Post colleague Rick Atkinson: 'Tell me how this ends.'' Trump himself once called the endless quagmire of the Iraq War, and the enormous sacrifice of blood and treasure there, 'the single worst decision ever made.' A huge part of the problem was that the Bush administration never really nailed down what circumstances would trigger the end of hostilities. As Richburg noted, if Trump has similarly nebulous ideas about what China could do to satisfy him, extracting the U.S. from this conflict could be challenging indeed.Now, in fairness, the Trump administration did lay out what they ostensibly want back in May. Their demands include a 60 percent reduction in America's trade deficit with China (which was $375 billion last year), an end to Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property, no more Chinese subsidies for its own tech companies, a reduction in China's tariffs on American exports, and for the Chinese government to allow more U.S. investment over there.But this too is reminiscent of the Iraq debacle. To the extent the Bush administration had a final goal in mind for the invasion, it was to turn Iraq into a democracy. But as specific criteria, this proved to be such a towering order that it was useless as a practical tool for assessing victory. Trump's demands for China are similarly sweeping. As The Washington Post put it, China would have to 'redo just about everything with its economy' to satisfy Trump.The Chinese, of course, completely balked at the list. For the moment, we have no actual answers for what could happen to convince the White House that its tariffs can come down.The problems continue if you break Trump's demands into their constituent parts. On its own, shrinking America's trade deficit with China is a fine idea. But tackling the problem export by export is a fool's errand. The problem is that the aggregate flow of American demand to Chinese jobs is not matched by an equivalent flow of Chinese demand to American jobs. We need to get our arms around the whole system: bring the value of the two nation's currencies into closer alignment by having the Chinese drain off their massive reserves of U.S. dollars.There's historical precedent for this. In the 1980s, America was running trade deficits with a number of major countries like France, Britain, Germany, and Japan. Congress threatened tariffs to remedy the problem, and the Reagan administration used that threat to convince the other countries to adjust the values of their currencies and bring the trade deficits down.Trump could use his own threat of tariffs in the exact same way with China. In fact, Trump repeatedly insisted on the campaign trail that the value of China's currency was a serious problem. Remarkably, though, that rhetoric has completely disappeared now that Trump is actually in the Oval Office. By all indications, the White House's plan is to browbeat the Chinese government into directing its economy to buy more U.S. goods and services. That is both wildly impractical and fails to get at the root causes of the problem.Or take the question of intellectual property. No doubt, China's practices in this arena are shady. And there's an obvious value in having trading partners who play by the rules. But when it comes to intellectual property law, the rules themselves are pretty ridiculous. It actually is in our interests for China to become a modern, advanced, wealthy economy. When that happens, they can sell America even better and more advanced goods. But they'll also have more money to buy more stuff from us. Insisting that the Chinese abide by draconian IP rules will slow that process down.More to the point, Trump's fundamental concern is American jobs. But the IP issue has little to do with that. It's not as if U.S. companies need the Chinese to fork over gobs of licensing and patent fees so they can create jobs and raise wages. American corporations are already enjoying enormous profit margins, and are sitting on a ton of cash. They could invest right now if they wanted to. In other words, the only people who are going to benefit by squeezing IP fees out of the Chinese are wealthy CEOs and shareholders.It's worth remembering that the president was a reality TV star. And in that profession, the point is ratings. There's little differentiation between putting on a show and getting results; the show is the result. And it's hard to escape the conclusion that this trade war is just another show Trump's putting on.In which case, will he ever let it end?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ADVERTISEMENTAmerica's protectionist president has chosen escalation. And now so should the Republican-controlled Congress.President Trump's foolish trade war could easily send America's accelerating economy into the ditch. But Trump, against all evidence, doesn't seem worried. That leaves it up to his party to take action against its leader and for its supposed free-market principles.If you're a super-optimist, the GOP pushback has already begun. On Wednesday, a day after the Trump administration's announcement that it plans to hit China with 10 percent tariffs on a further $200 billion in Chinese goods, the Senate voted 88-11 in favor of a GOP-authored provision that would give Congress a role when the president tries to levy tariffs on national security grounds under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. That's the section the Trump administration has cited as legal rationale to levy 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports.Free traders should keep their expectations low, however. The provision was non-binding, and it wouldn't have passed without Democratic votes. Only 39 Republicans voted for it, and at least one GOP senator, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, said he would not actually vote for the resolution if it had the force of law; he just wanted to support a non-binding signal.But it is long past time for signals and symbolic measures. After all, Trump was barely in office when he yanked America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And while the 2017 Trump agenda centered on health care and tax cuts, 2018 has been dominated by Trump's trade conflict with, well, pretty much everybody. This is exactly what candidate Trump promised, although too many in Washington and Wall Street bet that Trump's 40-year hostility to free and open trade was really just empty rhetoric. How wrong they were.If the GOP is really the pro-growth party of free markets, it must go beyond its squishy, cowering opposition to Trump's trade war and start pushing actually binding legislation requiring congressional approval before levying tariffs using that national security justification. Congress should begin to reclaim the trade authority it has spent decades giving away to the executive branch. Such legislation has been introduced in the House and Senate by Republicans. But its chances look dicey at best. House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Wednesday that while he opposes tariffs, he doesn't want 'to hamstring the president's negotiating tactics.'What negotiation? According to Kevin Brady, the GOP chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, 'Despite the serious economic consequences of ever-increasing tariffs, today there are no serious trade discussions occurring between the U.S. and China, no plans for trade negotiations anytime soon, and seemingly little action toward a solution.'Moreover, what does Ryan think Trump's endgame is? It certainly seems reasonable that what Trump and his trade hawk advisers are trying to accomplish â€” and the president's hostile and disruptive behavior at the NATO summit is more proof of this â€” is the dismantling of the post-WWII economic and security structure that continues to help ensure global peace and prosperity. To be replaced by what? Oh yeah, a slogan: America First.Maybe only further escalation and the resulting economic damage â€” from growth to jobs to the stock market â€” is what will get the GOP to finally take action against Trump. And that might happen, unfortunately. A new analysis by consultancy Capital Economics estimates that a full-blown global trade war could eventually reduce world GDP by 2â€“3 percent and U.S. GDP by around 1 percent. And 'the hit to profits of U.S. multinational firms would be more severe.' Even worse, all this could potentially hit just as the fiscal stimulus from tax cuts and spending increases fades, slowing growth.But it shouldn't take an economic slowdown or recession for Republicans, raised on Reaganomics, to do what most surely know is the right thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Trump will sit down with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday to discuss trade with the European Union, and it's not likely to be an easy meeting.Trump's refusal to back down from his tariffs on European steel and aluminum will make the meeting a tense one, reports Fortune, as Juncker, representing all EU nations, tries to convince him not to additionally impose steep tariffs on European cars. 'The relations are very tense, are at a very low point,' economist Danae Kyriakopoulou told CNBC. Trump earlier this month called the EU a 'foe,' criticizing 'what they do to us in trade.'Trump on Tuesday tweeted a suggestion that 'both the U.S. and the EU drop all tariffs, barriers, and subsidies,' but predicted that the EU wouldn't do it. While chances are extremely slim that the EU would go for any drastic change to its trade policies, EU trade commissioner Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m said last week that the bloc wants to find some way to 'create additional opportunities for trade and investment.'The European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade. I have an idea for them. Both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies! That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade! Hope they do it, we are ready - but they wonâ€™t! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2018Trump and Juncker will seek a middle ground, with MalmstrÃ¶m saying that the EU's priority is to 'de-escalate the present situation.' Even though Trump is facing criticism for some of his tariffs hurting American farmers, he has continued to express interest in tariffs on German cars. The tension 'doesnâ€™t set the scene for a very fruitful meeting,' said Kyriakopoulou. Read more at Fortune.

"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on Fox News Sunday to talk trade war, Iran, and Friday's report that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has proposed ousting President Trump from office using the 25th Amendment.'To the extent one wants to call this a trade war, we are determined to win it,' Pompeo said of Trump's escalating tariffs on Chinese imports. He ignored a question from host Chris Wallace about how long the administration would maintain this course, repeating, 'We're going to win it. We're going to get an outcome which forces China to behave' in accord with 'fundamental principles of trade around the world, fairness, reciprocity.'Though Pompeo, like Trump, has cast U.S. tariffs as a punishment for poor behavior from Beijing, the cost of the taxes is absorbed by American consumers, not Chinese producers. China's trade surplus with the United States has hit record highs since Trump's tariff scheme began.Turning to Iran, Pompeo pushed back on Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's angry response to Saturday's attack on an Iranian military parade. 'When you have a security incident at home, blaming others is an enormous mistake,' Pompeo argued, calling for Tehran to focus on domestic security 'rather than causing insecurity around the world.'And he slammed those, allegedly including Rosenstein, who have considered undermining the Trump administration from within. 'If you can't be on the team, if you're not supporting this mission,' Pompeo charged, 'maybe you've got something else to do.'Watch Pompeo's full interview below.

"On Feb. 28, John Ferriola, the CEO of Americaâ€™s largest steel producer, Nucor, got a call from the White House. Could he be in Washington the next day? With few details to go on, Ferriola dutifully showed up at the West Wing on March 1, where he and a dozen other metals-company executives were ushered into the Cabinet Room. Soon, they were told, they would be having a private meeting with President Donald Trump.The topic was the imposition of tariffs on imported steel and other metals, measures the industry has long sought. As Trump talked, it seemed to Ferriola that the President was leaning toward action but hadnâ€™t made up his mind. By the end of the meeting, encouraged by the executives, Trump seemed convinced. Immediately after, he told the press he planned to put surcharges of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum. â€œPeople have no idea how badly our country has been treated,â€? Trump said as the CEOs nodded along. â€œTheyâ€™ve destroyed the steel industry, theyâ€™ve destroyed the aluminum industry.â€? But, the President said, â€œweâ€™re bringing it all back.â€?Washington flew into a tizzy. The stock market swooned. Republicans rebuked Trump in dire terms. Soon rumors flew about the Presidentâ€™s motivations. He was said to have acted in a fit of pique, inflamed by special counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s ongoing Russia investigation and the resignation of his communications director and confidant Hope Hicks. But the President was undeterred. Responding to the hail of criticism the following morning, he tweeted with characteristic puckishÂ­ness: â€œTrade wars are good, and easy to win.â€?Trumpâ€™s declaration was exactly the sort of brazen middle finger to the establishment that he promised his voters in 2016. But for all his campaign populism, the GOP establishment had, to that point, been successful in constraining Trump on trade during his first year in power. Trumpâ€™s metals tariff, if he goes through with it, would represent a rare and consequential break with GOP orthodoxy.Trade policy has also been the subject of vicious infighting within the White House. Trumpâ€™s top economic adviser, free-market advocate and Goldman Sachs alum Gary Cohn, resigned on March 6 in the wake of the announcement. Yet even those closest to the issue werenâ€™t sure that Trump had made up his mind to impose the tariffs. The President seemed caught between competing impulses: his strong, long-standing convictions on trade, and his record of compliance with Republican doctrine.Since the 1980s, Trump has comÂ­plained that the U.S. was being cheated by unfair foreign competition. As a presidential candidate he hammered on the idea of â€œgetting toughâ€? with, in his distinctive pronunciation, â€œChyyy-nah.â€? Trumpâ€™s stance on trade set him apart from other Republicans and was at the heart of his appeal in formerly blue states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, and it epitomized his opposition to â€œglobalism,â€? elites and experts, and his emphasis on muscular nationalism. It was also bound up with darker impulses: xenophobic distrust and nostalgia for a bygone social hierarchy.The â€œforgotten man,â€? as Trump termed his bloc of blue collar supporters, welcomed the promise to make America great again by bringing back manufacturing. And after voters in the industrial heartland helped power him to victory, Trump suggested that he would make good on his rhetoric. In his Inaugural Address, he vividly evoked a landscape of â€œrusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.â€? The newly sworn-in President thundered, â€œWe must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.â€?Trade was just one of the populist promises that tradiÂ­tional Republicans feared Trump would follow through on in office. But they soon realized the new President was disengaged from policy details, easily distracted and susceptible to flattery. In practice, many of the policy disruptions Trump had threatenedâ€”from health care and taxes to, more recently, gun control and immigrationâ€”proved to be empty threats. As a result, despite his instincts, Trump has governed mainly as a conservative. On trade, the free-marketeers in the White House, like Cohn, succeeded in diverting Trump from scrapping NAFTA and other radical measures.But if Trumpâ€™s ardor for tariffs cooled, he was never persuaded to change his mind. In one Oval Office meeting, he vented to chief of staff John Kelly that he felt stymied by the globalists in his orbit, according to Axios. â€œI want tariffs. And I want someone to bring me some tariffs,â€? the President insisted. By March 1, Trump seemed finally to have cast off the restraints. But the furious behind-the-scenes campaign to temper his impulses has not let up, and until the papers are drawn up and signed, he could still change his mind.And so Washington, Wall Street and the steel industry wait to see which Trump will prevail: the gut-level protectionist or the good Republican soldier. Cohnâ€™s departure seemed to signal that the anti-tariff faction had lost the internal battle. â€œWeâ€™ve been waiting for the President and Administration to let us know whatâ€™s going on,â€? says Ferriola, the Nucor executive. â€œWeâ€™re hopeful that the President is going to move forward with the commitment he made during the campaign.â€?Write to Molly Ball at molly.ball@time.com.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"IDEAS Bremmer is a foreign affairs columnist and editor-at-large at TIME.Not so long ago, U.S. leaders predicted that economic development and the birth of a middle class in China would inevitably move that nation toward democracy. Instead, Chinaâ€™s leadership has profited from a weaker West. It has seized on opportunities created by European fragmentation and political dysfunction in Washington to offer China as an alternative model of stability and development.Another mistake by the U.S.: lawmakers doubted that China would ever become technologically innovative. They believed that, like the Soviet Union, Chinaâ€™s state-dominated economic system would hit a wall when it came to developing new ideas. Instead, China learned from Soviet mistakes. At first, the state allegedly helped Chinese companies steal ideas that couldnâ€™t be developed at home. But now China is investing huge sums in the artificial intelligence, robotics and data-management innovations that will determine tomorrowâ€™s balance of power.Chinaâ€™s President Xi Jinping declared in October that the nation must become a technological superpower. He has repeatedly emphasized the need to shed dependence on foreign intellectual property. â€œIndigenous innovationâ€? and technological self-reliance are now core to Chinaâ€™s development strategy. His Made in China 2025 program, backed with huge state subsidies for its tech sector, is central to Xiâ€™s vision.On May 29, President Trump launched an offensive against that plan. To protect its national security, the White House said in a statement, the U.S. will restrict investment in and control exports of â€œindustrially significant technology.â€? The Trump Administration proposes to slap 25% tariffs on some $50 billion of Chinese tech imports, including those related to the vaunted Made in China 2025 program. In essence, the battle for the future has been joined.Trump has been trying to strike a delicate balance in U.S. relations with China, and until now has blown hot and cold on trade. He adopted the tough stance he promised voters while blaming the $375 billion goods trade deficit on former U.S. Presidents rather than on Beijing. Trump would love to have warmer relations with China, just as he would with Russia. Trump has praised Xi just as heâ€™s repeatedly saluted Russiaâ€™s Vladimir Putin.Yet, as with Russia, a variety of actors in Washington have made it tough for Trump to build the China ties he wants. Trump pledged to save ZTE, a large Chinese telecom-equipment maker banned from purchasing U.S. technology for violating sanctions, as an apparent favor to Xi, but was attacked by lawmakers of both parties. Many fear that Trump fails to see the threat that Chinese tech companies like ZTE and Huawei pose to U.S. national security. Meanwhile, some American companies fear that U.S. trade action will make it tougher for them to do business in China. Trumpâ€™s own advisers are divided on how to proceed.Now the voices preaching confrontation with China appear to have won out. Neither side wants a full-blown trade war, but each believes it has a strong negotiating position. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will travel to Beijing for talks on June 2, but itâ€™s hard to see how Trump can claim victory without Chinese concessions on tech issues, and itâ€™s nearly impossible that Xi will offer him anything of value. This is where the risk of real conflict is most dangerous.Contact us at editors@time.com.This appears in the June 11, 2018 issue of TIME.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(Bloomberg) â€” Harley-Davidson Inc. cut its forecast for profit margin this year by an amount that suggests itâ€™s finding a way to cope with the damage done by President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade war.Harley sped up shipments to the European Union to blunt the impact of higher tariffs that the bloc enacted last month. As a result of the tariffs, operating margin this year will drop to about 9.5 percent, the midpoint of a range the Milwaukee-based manufacturer gave in a statement Tuesday, compared with a previous projection of about 10 percent. The squeeze wasnâ€™t as severe as analysts had anticipated.While the accelerated shipments reduced the cost of the levies to as much as $35 million this year, the annual impact may still run about $90 million to $100 million, Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich said during a conference call with analysts. The European tariffs, enacted as retaliation for Trumpâ€™s taxes on steel and aluminum imports, forced the motorcycle company to make moves it had never considered before.â€œWe are doing everything we can as a company to absorb the costs that we can,â€? Chief Financial Officer John Olin said on the call. â€œWe never contemplated moving our European volume out of the U.S. Consequently weâ€™re analyzing the capacity options that we have, manufacturing costs, supply chain, logistics, in an effort to optimize it and to reduce and mitigate those tariffs.â€?Harley shares rose 7.7 percent to close at $44.63 in New York, the biggest jump since October 2016. That pared the stockâ€™s loss this year to 12 percent.Adjusted profit for the second quarter was $1.52, beating analystsâ€™ average estimate for $1.41. Revenue slipped to $1.53 billion, topping the average projection for $1.42 billion.Trumpâ€™s AttackHarley was caught in the crossfire of Trumpâ€™s trade war last month when it announced plans to shift some U.S. production overseas to sidestep higher tariffs imposed by the EU. The president attacked the iconic American company, claiming it was using the levies as an excuse to send jobs overseas. Harley had already announced plans to close a factory in Missouri and build a plant in Thailand.The EU tariffs, which came in retaliation to Trumpâ€™s steel and aluminum levies, will cost about $2,200 per motorcycle shipped to Harleyâ€™s second-biggest market, the company estimated in a June 25 filing. The manufacturer hasnâ€™t specified which of its overseas plants will begin producing bikes for European riders.Harley is trying to navigate escalating trade tensions as sales in its core U.S. market continue to shrink. Bike deliveries in the U.S. sank 6.4 percent in the second quarter, the 14th decline out of the last 15 quarters. Worldwide sales fell 3.6 percent.The EU enacted tariffs on Harley bikes and other U.S.-made products, such as blue jeans and Kentucky bourbon, on June 22, so it had a limited effect on second-quarter results. International sales increased 0.7 percent, driven by gains in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.Turnaround PlanLevatich has struggled to attract younger consumers with premium motorcycles and has begun to release a series of cheaper bikes. Heâ€™s aiming to cultivate 2 million new U.S. riders by 2027 and for half of global revenue to come from outside the U.S. Harley will release more details about its turnaround strategy on July 30.Harleyâ€™s forecast for motorcycle shipments this year was unchanged, and its moves to consolidate U.S. manufacturing are on track, which may help offset investor jitters about the tariff hit, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a research note.â€œWhile this may give pause to the pressure facing the stock, itâ€™s unlikely to entice serious incremental capital,â€? he said.Contact us at editors@time.com.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In recent years, the annual meeting of the U.S. soybean export group has been a celebratory affair complete with a grand signing ceremony during which attendees committed to exporting billions of dollars of U.S. soybeans to China.But following months of escalating trade tensions Chinese attendees at this yearâ€™s confab in Kansas City last week carried a different message: China doesnâ€™t need U.S. soybeans.In a keynote presentation, a leading official from Chinaâ€™s grain sector laid out how the country not only can buy soybeans elsewhere but can also switch to entirely different types of crops to supply its livestock and feed its population. Such a move would undercut global demand for soybeans and prevent the U.S. from simply turning to other countries.â€œIf the trade tensions cannot be resolved quickly, the decrease in purchasing volumes of American soybeans will continue,â€? said Mu Yan Kui, an executive at the Yihai Kerry Group, a Chinese grain company, and vice chairman of China National Association of Grain Economy. â€œMany people have underestimated the Chinese people.â€?China, which bought more than 60% of U.S. soybean in the 2016-2017 sales year largely to feed its stocks of livestock, has already begun to look to new places like Brazil as a source of the product. Thatâ€™s no surprise to U.S. farmers who have long understood Trumpâ€™s trade agenda would hurt in the short term, but U.S. exporters thought they would be able to stem the tide by developing new markets. If China buys more soybeans from Brazil, other Brazilian customers in Europe and Asia would turn to the U.S. Or so the farmers thought.The plan laid out by Mu would undercut that shift to the detriment of U.S. farmers. In excruciating detail, Mu listed palm mill, rapeseed, sunflower seed and other crops among those alternatives. And he pointed to Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan as places where China would look to work with farmers to develop new crop sources and improve yields.â€œThe United States is going to become the warehouse for global soybean supplies,â€? says Paul Burke, regional director for North Asia at the U.S. Soybean Export Council. â€œThis is the realization that weâ€™re coming to within the trade within the last couple of weeks.â€?â€™Thatâ€™s damaging for the U.S. industry in the short term, but industry insiders say that the effect could last far longer than the next season if the Chinese develop new relationships and come to view the U.S. as an unreliable trade partner. â€œAs a farmer you fear that the Administration may not understand that,â€? says Monte Peterson, a North Dakota soybean farmer who serves on the board of directors at the American Soybean Association.Whether China will actually make good on the threat to soybean farmers remains to be seen. The country has expanded its capacity to process soybeans and abandoning those efforts would be costly. The Trump Administration has gambled that the current strength of the U.S. economy will allow the country to outlast China in the ongoing trade disputes. Meanwhile, economic growth in China has slowed in recent years and remains tenuous.Nonetheless Chinaâ€™s response to soybeans underscores the dangers for the U.S. of a trade war between the worldâ€™s two largest economies. The highly coordinated nature of the countryâ€™s economy and agricultural sector leave little doubt that the country could deploy a destructive response if it chose to do so. In his presentation, Mu argued that the trade war would lead to a depreciation of the value American farmland and a â€œdevastating impactâ€? on farmers while leaving China in the clear.â€œIt has a very small impact on China,â€? Mu said of the any damage the soybean processing industry feels.And, while China recently opened the door for Xi Jinping to remain its leader for life, elected officials in the U.S. face regular elections and potential blowback when policies go awry. Trumpâ€™s trade agenda is already broadly unpopular with a majority of Americans saying free trade is a â€œgood thing,â€? according to a May Pew Research poll. This fallâ€™s midterm elections will prove a crucial test of those policies.The most affected elements of Trumpâ€™s base â€” like heartland farmers â€” have shown a willingness to stick with the president while he pushes for renegotiated trade deals and an end to unfair trade practices in places like China. Trumpâ€™s announcement last week that he had reached a deal with Mexico to replace NAFTA with an improved deal provided a burst of confidence to many here on the ground that the Trump administration can conclude trade discussions with China and the European Union in the coming months. But many question whether the patience will last into the next growing season when the scale of the damage becomes clear.â€œRural America has supported the president and continues to overall,â€? says Ray Gaesser, a corn and soybean farmer in Corning, Iowa. â€œAs you have more and more financial pressure, that might change.â€?Write to Justin Worland at justin.worland@time.com.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"China stocks have best day in seven weeksSharelinesShanghai: China's stock markets rallied on Tuesday as President Xi Jinping's vow to further open up the economy soothed fears of a trade war with the United States.The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 1.9 per cent, to 3,927.17 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.7 per cent to 3,190.32, in their best single-day performance in seven weeks.Xi pledged on Tuesday to open the country's economy further to foreign investors and lower import tariffs on products including cars, in a speech seen as an attempt to defuse an escalating trade dispute with Washington.While most of the pledges were reiterations of long-promised measures and were short on specifics, markets believed they signalled some room for a possible compromise with Washington.'With his speech, Xi is offering a solution to the Sino-US trade dispute,' said Yang Hai, strategist at Kaiyuan Securities.Jonas Short, head of the Beijing office at Everbright Sun Hung Kai said the market reacted positively to Xi's speech because it was framed in more positive terms, without the increasingly combative rhetoric seen from both sides.But he voiced caution about the likely extent of such reforms.'China is opening sectors where they already have a distinct advantage, or a stranglehold over the sector,' Short said, citing China's banking industry, which is dominated by domestic players.Xi also said China would speed up opening up of its insurance industry, with Shanghai Securities News citing a government researcher after the speech saying foreign investors should be able to hold a controlling stake or even full ownership of an insurance company in the future.Sectors rallied across the board on Tuesday.Gains were led by banking and real estate shares.China's stocks are among fund managers' top picks for 2018 as they bet the United States and China will avert a full-blown and potentially costly trade war.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"After lengthy second round of talks in Washington, the two sides issued a joint statement early today vowing not to launch a trade war against each other. â€œWeâ€™re putting the trade war on hold. Right now, we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework,â€? US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. â€œThat is we are going to reduce the trade deficit. We have an agreement with China that they will substantially agree to it,â€? he said. â€œThere was a consensus on taking effective measures to substantially reduce the US trade deficit in goods with China,â€? the joint statement said. â€œTo meet the growing consumption needs of the Chinese people and the need for high-quality economic development, China will significantly increase purchases of United States goods and services,â€? it added. This will help support growth and employment in the US. Mnuchin said the US and China had agreed to back off from imposing tariffs on each other.â€œWe have made very meaningful progress and we agreed on a framework,â€? Mnuchin told Fox News Sunday. â€œSo right now we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework.â€? President Donald Trump has threatened punitive measures against Chinese goods if Beijing does not cut down the trade deficit by USD 100 billion in a month and USD 200 billion by 2020. The US says it has a USD 375 billion trade deficit in the USD 636 billion worth of total trade last year. China says the trade deficit is around USD 200 billion.China too threatened a tit-for-tat retaliation but blinked in the end with a categorical undertaking to import more goods from US. The two sides agreed on meaningful increases in US agriculture and energy exports. The US will send a team to China to work out the details, said the joint statement at the conclusion of the trade delegation level talks. The US delegation included Mnuchin, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur L Ross, and US Trade Representative Robert E Lighthizer. The Chinese delegation was led by Vice Premier Liu He, the Special Envoy of President Xi Jinping. The two sides also discussed expanding trade in manufactured goods and services with a consensus on the need for favourable conditions to increase trade in these areas.The two nations attach great importance to the protection of intellectual property rights and agreed to strengthen cooperation. China will advance relevant amendments to its laws and regulations in this area, including the patent law, the joint statement said. The two trade delegations also agreed to encourage two-way investment and to strive to create a fair, level playing field for competition. â€œBoth sides agreed to continue to engage at high levels on these issues and to seek to resolve their economic and trade concerns in a proactive manner,â€? the statement said. Liu told state-run China Daily that the trade talks are â€œquite successful, very meaningful and very fruitfulâ€?. Asked about what will be followed up in the coming months, Liu said that the two sides will see where â€œwe have reached the consensusâ€?, and that they have already established some working groups, including the agricultural group, for consultations on concrete areas. â€œMaybe some US government ministers will lead the groups to Beijing and will meet our colleagues to have deeper discussions with us and try to make concrete deals,â€? he said.The agreement came after reports that China has agreed to cut the deficit by USD 200 billion. A draft framework of US demands include that China cut the trade deficit by at least USD 200 billion by the end of 2020. Washington also demanded Beijing halt subsidies for industries under the â€˜Made in China 2025â€™ plan, and that China should not resort to retaliatory measures against the US. The trade spat between the top two economies of the world began last month with Trump imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US. China retaliated by imposing additional tariffs worth USD three billion on 128 US products. Trump, while demanding China reduce the USD 375 billion by USD 100 billion, responded with USD 50 billion tariffs on Chinese products. In further retaliation, China announced plans to impose new tariffs of 25 per cent worth USD 50 billion on 106 American products including items like soybean which could hurt US farmers. The two countries have not yet implemented the tariff hikes.Meanwhile, the opposition Democratic party criticised the Trump administration for having failed to make much progress in trade disputes with China. â€œWe also discussed very important structural issues that they are going to make in their economy to make sure that we have a fair ability to compete there, and also protections about technology, which have been very important to the president,â€? Mnuchin said. When asked if the presidentâ€™s threat of USD 50 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods and USD 150 billion are all on hold, he said, â€œYes they are. And the president had a very productive meeting with the vice premier in the Oval Office, with all of us and the vice president. He heard these commitments himself and he can always decide to put the tariffs back on if China doesnâ€™t go through with their commitments,â€? Mnuchin said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Harley-Davidson is one of the big U.S. companies changing business practices to adapt to President Trump's tariffs and foreign retaliation. (Pixabay/MGN)The ramifications of President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade policies may grow in the months ahead for United States manufacturers and farmers as trading partners respond to tariffs imposed on their goods with similar taxes on U.S. exports, and none of the countries involved have displayed any willingness to back down from what could prove to be a politically and economically costly fight.Wisconsin-based Harley-Davidson announced Monday it will move production of some motorcycles for foreign markets out of the U.S. in the wake of the European Union raising tariffs on its products from 6 percent to 31 percent last Friday, a response to the Trump administrationâ€™s recent tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum.'Harley-Davidson maintains a strong commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing which is valued by riders globally,' the company said in a statement. 'Increasing international production to alleviate the EU tariff burden is not the companyâ€™s preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe.'The motorcycle manufacturer has not said if this shift will result in any layoffs for U.S. staff, but it has asserted it will not pass the increased costs created by the tariffs onto customers. Absorbing the expense could cost the company $90 million a year.In a tweet Monday, Trump accused the company, which he has praised in the past, of being 'the first to wave the White Flag' and suggested businesses should be more patient as he attempts to negotiate better deals.As European tariffs were imposed Friday, President Trump was already threatening further actions. On Twitter, he floated the prospect of placing a 20 percent tariff on cars imported from Europe.In recent weeks, Midwestern newspapers have featured many stories of local businesses endangered by imposed and proposed tariffs, and national media outlets have reported on businesses and industries in states that Trump won in 2016 that could take a hit.One Missouri nail company reported a loss of half its business in two weeks due to tariffs Trump placed on Mexican steel it needs for production. One economist told The Associated Press the American pork industry could lose $2.2 billion per year if tariffs China imposed in response to Trumpâ€™s metal tariffs remain in effect.While the tariff standoff with the European Union is forcing significant adjustments for U.S. businesses, a trade fight with China is also poised to escalate in the weeks ahead, potentially endangering more industries.The Treasury Department plans to announce new investment and export restrictions this week that are reportedly aimed at preventing China from overtaking U.S. leadership in industries like robotics, electric cars, and aerospace. Specific details of the proposal have not been made public but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeted that it will be â€œnot specific to China, but to all countries that are trying to steal our technology.â€?Next Friday, tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese products are slated to take effect. China has already threatened to retaliate, and Trump has threatened to retaliate for that retaliation. If all of the presidentâ€™s threats are carried out, nearly 90 percent of Chinese exports to the U.S. will be covered by tariffs.â€œIn the West you have the notion that if somebody hits you on the left cheek, you turn the other cheek,â€? Chinese President Xi Jinping said at a meeting with CEOs Thursday, according to the Wall Street Journal. â€œIn our culture, we punch back.â€?Though exact definitions of â€œtrade warâ€? vary, several economists agreed Monday that the U.S. is currently embroiled in at least one trade war.â€œWeâ€™ve had tit and tat, President Trump has threatened another round, so I would say, yes, we absolutely are in a trade warâ€¦,â€? said Mary Lovely, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a professor at Syracuse University. â€œAny way you look at it, itâ€™s happening, and the real concerning thing is itâ€™s on multiple fronts, multiple products, multiple countries.â€?The tariffs on steel and aluminum that instigated these confrontations were ostensibly issued to protect national security, but Keith Maskus, a professor of economics at the University of Colorado-Boulder and former chief economist for the State Department, argued that will be a difficult position to maintain legally and logically when talking about metals produced by longtime allies.â€œItâ€™s really hard to make the case the U.S. is doing anything other than damaging the global trading system,â€? he said.The ongoing volleys of threats and counter-threats have generated bipartisan concern on Capitol Hill. Many lawmakers interviewed last week applauded the president for challenging Chinaâ€™s questionable trade tactics, but they urged more caution and cooperation with allies in doing so.â€œI give the president credit for trying to go after the Chinese,â€? said Rep. Darin LaHood, R-Ill., Wednesday. â€œTheyâ€™ve continually ripped us off with intellectual property, with forced technology transfers, particularly in the military and cyber areas, we have to hold them accountable. But getting into a trade war where thereâ€™s retaliation on our agricultural exports is detrimental to our agriculture economy.â€?Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said the White House needs a more strategic approach to tackle Chinaâ€™s misdeeds while limiting collateral damage.â€œI would rather he be focused on China with all of our allies with us,â€? she said. â€œThere are important ways China is stealing our ideas, our patents, there are unfair trade practices going on. I want to be tough on that, but at the same time, the way theyâ€™re doing it is going to have so many unintended consequences for our small businesses, large businesses, and farmers and ultimately consumers.â€?Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he had discussed the issue with the president and urged him to resolve differences with allies on trade.â€œThis is creating such a high level of uncertainty,â€? he said. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of micro damage being done right now. Steel prices are up, aluminum prices are up, making us less competitive on the global market. Jobs are being lost. This is not a good situation. It canâ€™t go on forever.â€?Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., told ABC News Sunday that he and â€œa number of senatorsâ€? are willing to halt Trumpâ€™s judicial nominees to force votes on issues like trade. In a Senate where Republicans effectively hold a one-vote majority while Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., receives cancer treatment, Flakeâ€™s vote could be a deciding factor for many nominees.â€œWeâ€™re in the nascent stages of a full-scale trade war, and the President simply seems to want to escalate, and it all stems to the steel and aluminum tariffs,â€? he said.Flake is retiring in January and Trump has brushed off his criticisms many times before, but the threat represents a significant escalation, assuming other senators are truly willing to join him. Few Republicans have done more than strenuously object to Trumpâ€™s trade policies so far.Earlier this month, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who is also retiring at the end of this term, introduced legislation that would require Trump to get congressional approval for trade actions taken in the name of national security. Corker told reporters many of his colleagues agreed with him but were afraid to support the bill and incur Trumpâ€™s wrath.Despite the increasingly frayed nerves of rank-and-file Republicans, GOP leaders have resisted calls to constrain Trumpâ€™s tariff-imposing powers, arguing such measures would undermine his negotiating position. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., dismissed Corkerâ€™s bill as â€œan exercise in futility.â€?Experts say fighting a war on many fronts at once may not be the most effective way to redress legitimate complaints about unfair trade practices, especially concerning China. Many other trading partners share the U.S. governmentâ€™s concerns about intellectual property rights, market access and regulatory restraints, but picking fights with those partners could make it harder to secure their cooperation against China.â€œThis has been an administration that has decided going unilaterally is the best way to get concessions,â€? Lovely said. â€œI think weâ€™re seeing that does not work.â€?Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University and a policy adviser to the Heartland Institute, noted that presenting a united front against China was partly the purpose of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which President Trump backed out of soon after taking office.â€œIf youâ€™re going to go against something thatâ€™s bad,â€? he said, â€œitâ€™s better to do it with a lot of friends, not just one screaming guy.â€?Tensions are rising between the U.S. and the European Union, but EU officials met with high-level Chinese representatives Monday in advance of a planned summit on trade and economics.'I am confident that the exchanges we have had with my new counterpart, Liu He, have been useful in paving the way towards a successful EU-China Summit in the economic and trade field. I am particularly pleased with the progress achieved in our investment negotiations and look forward to an exchange of offers at the Summit,' Jyrki Katainen, European Commission vice president, said in a statement.In theory, Hicks said, eliminating all trade barriers would great, but in reality, it would amount to â€œunilateral disarmament.â€? Countries, including the U.S., keep some tariffs in place for a reason to protect narrow industries and interest groups, and it will be difficult to convince democratically-elected leaders to abandon them.â€œThe president is rightâ€”the trade deals could be better,â€? he said. â€œTheyâ€™re not crummy, the tariffs are smaller than theyâ€™ve ever been, theyâ€™re not bad deals, but they could always be better.â€?With European retaliatory tariffs taking effect and China preparing new tariffs of its own while the Trump administration moves to restrict Chinese investment, the situation could get worse before it gets better. Once this cycle of tariffs and retaliation begins, it is hard to find an off-ramp.â€œIt took a long time and a severe reduction in trade volumes back in the 1930s,â€? Maskus said. â€œI donâ€™t know how comparable that is to todayâ€™s world.â€?Even if Trump rolls back his tariffs, there is no guarantee the retaliatory penalties will be lifted. If for no other reason than to discourage American presidents from doing this again, Hicks predicted they likely would not be.â€œOur trading partners wonâ€™t want to regard this sort of brinkmanship and so are likely to preserve the tariffs long after weâ€™ve dropped them,â€? he said.Trumpâ€™s strong-arm approach has left even countries that would have been amenable to making some concessions holding firm to avoid looking weak.â€œI definitely think they would have been willing to have serious negotiations at the beginning,â€? Lovely said of China. â€œNow weâ€™ve given them very little political space.â€?Trump may be playing to protectionist supporters who see his policies as fulfilling his promise to put America first, but Xi Jinping has his own constituency.â€œBeing bullied by the U.S. is something he cannot be seen as allowing,â€? Lovely said.Other leaders who faced off with Trump at the G-7 summit in Canada expressed similar sentiments.â€œCanadians, weâ€™re polite, weâ€™re reasonable, but we also will not be pushed around,â€? Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said after the meeting. â€œI donâ€™t want to hurt American workers. Theyâ€™re our neighbors. Theyâ€™re our friends. But my job is to stand up for Canadian workers, Canadian interests, and I will do that without flinching.â€?Tariffs planned and implemented by the EU, China, and Canada seem carefully crafted to carry the heftiest political impact. Harley-Davidson is based in House Speaker Paul Ryanâ€™s state of Wisconsin. Bourbon distillers in McConnellâ€™s home state of Kentucky have already been targeted. Farmers and manufacturers who make up a sizable portion of President Trumpâ€™s base are squarely and deliberately in their crosshairs.â€œNations want to impose the greatest political pain on the administration enacting the tariffs,â€? Hicks said. â€œThat means targeting the production of U.S. goods made in places that are the strongest supporters of this current administration.â€?According to Hicks, 17 percent of U.S. GDP growth in 2017 was accounted for by exports, as was much of the recent resurgence in the manufacturing sector. As a result, trading partners constructing obstacles to exports could substantially hamper the economy over time.â€œThe biggest economic effects will take many months, maybe even a year or so to be fully realized,â€? he said. â€œBut, as early as the end of summer, manufacturing and farming intensive communities should start feeling economic pain associated with tariffs.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Please enable Javascript to watch this videoDES MOINES, Iowa -- 'It's scary, but I have to trust that there are people that know more than I know about trade wars,' said Kevin Rasmussen of KLR Pork, a farrow-to-finish swine enterprise in Humboldt County. Rasmussen is optimistic about the future of the U.S. pork industry.'I do believe the people in this world have gotten a taste of what really good fresh pork tastes like,'said Rasmussen. 'And if it goes up a little bit in price, are they willing to pay the more price? I believe they will.'But some industry experts say there is cause for concern.'Dermot Hayes of Iowa State University has stated it's gonna have a $12.50 up to $14 per pig cost to us as to that money that we will not get from the market,' said Gregg Hora, President of the Iowa Pork Producers Association. 'So yes, we are concerned about any duties or tariffs in retaliation on U.S. pork.'Hora says a lot of work has gone into establishing relationships with trading partners in North America and around the world, and the pork industry in Iowa has been built up significantly.'We generally grow 3-4 percent per year of not just production numbers, but also efficiencies and output,' said Hora. 'So with that we've built up an economic system here in Iowa with jobs, investment and here at the World Pork Expo, you can sure see the vendors that are here, that are investing not only new technologies, but farmers are buying those technologies.'That's why the National Pork Producers Council is trying to convince the Trump Administration that trade agreements like NAFTA are critical to the success of pork producers.'So, in terms of dollars, last year we exported over one and a half billion dollars to Canada and Mexico,' said Maria Zieba, Director of International Affairs for NPPC. 'It is vital that we maintain what we have within NAFTA.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Posted Sunday, April 8, 2018 7:10 pmFor the past few weeks, all the presidentâ€™s talk about trade wars has been an abstract notion for most of us â€” a concern for policymakers in Washington but nothing that would come home to disrupt our daily lives.But when China announced last Monday that itâ€™s slapping a 25 percent tariff on pork products in retaliation to President Trumpâ€™s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the global became local. It may be just a little sting, but weâ€™re worried about what will happen if this is only the first round of a trade war soon to escalate.North Carolina is the second-biggest pork-producing state in the country and most of the producers are in eastern North Carolina. According to pork industry statistics, Sampson and Duplin counties are the top two pork-producing counties in the country. Between them they raise more than a third of the more than 9 million hogs produced annually in this state. Thatâ€™s a lot of spare ribs.And in the case of China exports, thatâ€™s a lot of pigsâ€™ feet, ears and stomachs, the primary products that China buys from American pork producers. According to a report this week by WUNC, North Carolina exported about $100 million in pork products to China last year. Itâ€™s unclear whether the new tariffs would kill that business. Equally puzzling is why China first targeted pork, since the Chinese company WH Group owns Smithfield Foods, this countryâ€™s largest pork producer, which also operates the worldâ€™s largest pork processing facility, just down N.C. 87 in Bladen County.But then, China raises most of its own pork supply, importing only 3 percent of its pork products from the U.S. The biggest American pork importers are Canada and Mexico, a fact that should touch off big what-if concerns if the president makes good on his threats to blow up the North American Free Trade Agreement.But thatâ€™s only the beginning of our worries. Trump and China are both making noises about escalating a trade war, and China is signaling that agricultural imports will be the earliest targets for new tariffs. Corn and soybeans â€” big business for North Carolina farmers â€” have already been mentioned.The agricultural focus of Chinaâ€™s first wave of retaliatory tariffs makes it clear that the country is aiming a spear at the rural, agricultural parts of this country where the president has had the greatest support. If business is hurt and this causes Trumpâ€™s popularity to decline, there surely will be smiles in Beijing.But if the trade war escalates, this state can be hurt in many more ways. North Carolinaâ€™s economy did $32.6 billion in export business last year and China was our third-biggest trading partner â€” trailing only Canada and Mexico. Overall trade with China last year brought $2.3 billion into this stateâ€™s economy. Chemicals are by far this stateâ€™s biggest export product, followed by transportation equipment, machinery, computer and electronic products and textiles and fabrics (yes, weâ€™re still in that business, to the tune of $1.9 billion in exports last year). Again, weâ€™re worried more about the fall of NAFTA here than a tariff battle with China, however painful that might be.Given the delicate balance of a global economy, we doubt the presidentâ€™s assurances that a trade war is easy to win, with few consequences for the American economy. But given the huge trade imbalance between the U.S. and China â€” we import from China vastly more than we export to it â€” itâ€™s likely survivable.But weâ€™re much more worried about the presidentâ€™s threats to tear up other trade agreements, especially NAFTA, which has turned the U.S., Canada and Mexico into what in many ways is a unified economy â€” much to the benefit of all three countries.As much as the president wants to build a protective wall around this nationâ€™s manufacturers, disrupting the global economy and free trade will cause far more harm than good for the American economy. We hope he heeds the early signs that this wonâ€™t end well for us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"China's car market is the world's largest, and one of the most lucrative, so it's no surprise that it has become a flashpoint in the simmering trade battle between the United States and China.President Trump continually has called out China for its high tariffs and barriers to entry, but China isn't alone in zealously protecting its domestic auto market. Many countries seek to shield their automakers from full-on foreign competition â€” including the U.S., when it comes to trucks.Tensions between the U.S. and China over autos are relatively new â€” Chinese cars only recently good enough for the American market, says Mary Lovely of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. But she adds that that is changing rapidly, 'a scary proposition.'U.S. trade officials are pressing China about the barriers to their market, she says â€” specifically a 25 percent tariff on imported cars. In a somewhat conciliatory speech this week, China's President Xi Jinping pledged to cut that levy.The U.S. has a much lower tariff of just 2.5 percent on imported cars â€” but has a tariff ten times higher on foreign-made trucks.'We haven't exactly examined our own house,' says Lovely.From chicken to trucks, from Germany to ChinaIn the car business, that long-lived tariff is called the 'chicken tax.'Its roots are in a trade dispute between the U.S. and Germany in the early 1960s, initially focused on frozen chicken parts. The dispute was dubbed the Chicken Wars, and it's the topic of a short film by NPR's Planet Money team.In the early 1960s, German consumers began to crave American frozen chicken. When consumption shot up, German farmers lobbied and got a 50 percent tax on imported chicken.The U.S. responded by putting a 25 percent tariff on all foreign-made light industrial vehicles, including pickup trucks and commercial vans.Over time, the tax on the frozen chicken went away â€” but the tariff on all foreign trucks has not. It even got extended as a part of trade deal reached between the U.S. and South Korea.Lovely says the trade dispute over frozen chicken 'was a tit-for-tat type of situation similar to what we're seeing right now between the United States and the Chinese.'The spat with Germany faded away, but the tariff on truck imports has shaped the American auto industry, making it much more focused on building lucrative pickup trucks.'Manufacturers came to depend on it to maintain healthy profit margins,' says Lovely. 'And so it just never went away.'Lovely says if the U.S. is serious about asking the Chinese to open their markets, then 'we're going to see some pressure on that 25 percent truck tariff that came out of the Chicken Wars.'Chinese tariffs, European brands, Southern plantsThe very public trade dispute between the U.S. and China has been marked by threats and counter-threats, as well as moments when the prospect of an all out trade war seems to recede. That was the case this week when China's President Xi Jinping spoke of the benefits of globalization and further opening China's economy.Only a few days earlier the Chinese government had ratcheted up the tension, threatening to double their tariffs on imported SUVs to 50 percent. It's uncertain if China will follow through, but if it does if it does the biggest losers could be German carmakers such as BMW and Mercedes Benz that build their SUVs in the U.S., in places like Spartanburg, S.C., and Tuscaloosa, Ala.Rebecca Lindland with Kelley Blue Book says while people may not be very sympathetic to those to those luxury brands, 'they should be quite sympathetic to the local workers and the dealers that would be negatively impacted if those two companies in particular really started to go through financial pain.'Lindland says the problem with trade wars are the unintended consequences. If the Chinese tariff gets imposed, Lindland says companies such Mercedes and BMW that build and export in the U.S. will cut production, 'which means cutting staff, cutting wages â€” cut, cut, cut ... that's all I see in the future.'That future, where both China and the U.S. follow through with their most severe threats, is a worst case scenario. Charged rhetoric or trash talk is common in trade disputes.China's President Xi Jinping this week lowered the temperature, saying he's open to reducing tariffs on imported cars. Maybe the SUV threat is a bluff, and instead of raising barriers, trade negotiators will agree to lower them.But that likely will require U.S. concessions as well â€” and China and every other country that builds trucks will be eyeing the chicken tax.Copyright 2018 NPR.

China is the biggest car market in the world and one of the most lucrative. It's also one of the toughest to crack for foreign manufacturers. President Trump has called out China for its high tariffs and barriers to entry, yet China is not alone in protecting its domestic automakers. The U.S. does it, too, as NPR's Sonari Glinton reports.SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: China really doesn't export cars to the U.S. Mary Lovely of the Peterson Institute for International Economics says, until now, Chinese cars haven't been good enough for the U.S. market, but that is changing rapidly.MARY LOVELY: And so we see on the horizon that China may be able to do that, and that's a scary proposition. And now we're saying, let's see, is it really fair that they have these barriers in their own market?GLINTON: But at the same time, we have...LOVELY: We do.GLINTON: (Unintelligible).LOVELY: Yes, we haven't exactly (laughter) - we haven't exactly examined our own house. Yes, we do on light trucks. We do.GLINTON: Now, Lovely is referring to what's called in the car business the chicken tax - yes, chicken tax. Now, this started with a trade dispute between the U.S. and Germany in the early '60s over frozen chicken parts, called the chicken wars. Now, my colleagues at Planet Money loved the chicken wars so much that they made a short film.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)ROBERT SMITH, BYLINE: You want to tax our chicken? Fine.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SMITH: Fine. We will find some German things that we can tax. So in 1963, the U.S. goes and puts a 25 percent tariff on foreign trucks. That includes commercial vans, light trucks and regular, old pickups. And Germany wasn't the only one affected. The U.S. applied it to all foreign-made commercial vehicles.GLINTON: Now, the tax on frozen chicken - that went away. But the 25 percent tariff on foreign trucks has not. And this would all be kind of funny if it weren't for consequences.LOVELY: And it was a tit-for-tat situation, similar to what we're seeing right now between the United States and the Chinese.GLINTON: Again, Mary Lovely.LOVELY: Unfortunately, that truck tax became quite popular. And manufacturers came to depend on it to maintain healthy profit margins, and so it just never went away.GLINTON: And Lovely says the truck makers don't want to give up their advantage.LOVELY: And so they're not going to let that go easily. If it becomes a case where we are serious about asking the Chinese to open up their market further in autos - say, by reducing their 25 percent tariffs on full vehicles that are exported to the Chinese market - then we're going to see some pressure on that 25 percent truck tariff that came out of the chicken wars.GLINTON: The Chinese government recently threatened to double their tariffs on imported SUVs to 50 percent. And the irony here is that the biggest losers could be German carmakers, like BMW and Mercedes, that build their SUVs in the U.S. - in places like Spartanburg, S.C., and Tuscaloosa, Ala. Rebecca Lindland is with Kelley Blue Book, and she says that would hurt American workers in the South.REBECCA LINDLAND: They'll have to cut down their exports, which means cutting down the plant production, which means cutting staff, cutting wages - cut, cut, cut. That's all you see. That's all I see in the future if this goes into effect - is cuts.GLINTON: Now, there's a lot of trash talk in trade disputes. And China's President Xi Jinping - this week - lowered the temperature. He says that he's open to reducing tariffs on imported cars. And lowering those barriers, though, won't come without a cost, so China and every country that builds cars will be eyeing the chicken tax.

President Trump should have negotiated trade deals before doing battle with China and getting into a full fledged trade war. Thatâ€™s according to South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds who appeared on Drive Time on WNAX this week with Von and Fred.He says the U.S. trade policy should be to get successful deals in place while working with our allies before embarking on any trade disputes.Rounds says while most farmers and ranchers support President Trump they are concerned that the longer the tariff battle goes on the harder it will be on them and their bottom line.Rounds met recently with a Chinese ambassador and is hoping that the U.S. and China will be able to resolve their differences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By Julie Gordon(Reuters) - The worldâ€™s biggest oil and gas players are gathering for a summit in Washington D.C. this week that will be overshadowed by the specter of shifting trade patterns due to a trade dispute between the United States and China.The uncertainty comes at a historic moment for the United States, which has become the worldâ€™s biggest natural gas producer, one of the top crude oil producers, and a growing exporter of both. It will host the triennial World Gas Conference for the first time in 30 years.'The timing is unfortunate,' said Charlie Riedl, executive director of the Center for LNG, noting the U.S.-China trade scuffle has ramped up uncertainty just as the next wave of U.S. liquefied natural gas producers are trying to finalize offtake deals needed to start construction.Beijing this month proposed 25 percent tariffs on U.S. petroleum imports, a retaliation against President Donald Trumpâ€™s tariffs on Chinese goods that is expected to dent sales to the U.S. shale industry's largest customer - adding new pressure for firms that produce natural gas as a byproduct of crude production.While LNG imports have so far been spared, the industry is concerned that the supercooled gas could be next if China's talks with Washington sour â€“ something that would disadvantage U.S. developers but help rivals also courting China.'I don't know that it prevents deals from happening, but I think it gives buyers pause,' Riedl said.The conference will draw executives from global energy giants like Exxon Mobil Corp , BP Plc , and Total SA , along with senior officials from the U.S. State Departmentâ€™s energy bureau, and ministers from energy producers and consumers like Argentina and Indonesia.It follows last weekâ€™s OPEC meetings in Vienna, where the partner countries agreed on a modest increase in oil production from next month, following calls from major consumers to curb rising fuel costs.The Trump administration is eager to expand its 'energy dominance' agenda by offering more U.S. oil, coal and LNG to Europe and other takers, as an alternative to supplies from geopolitical rivals like Russia, while also forging bonds with big players like China.The United States has made some inroads with sales of LNG to Poland and Lithuania, but faces a tough task selling large amounts of LNG to wider parts of Europe, especially as Russia's Gazprom and a consortium of partners advance a new pipeline under the Baltic Sea to Germany.'We want to see a global gas market that is market-driven, prevents countries from using gas for political purposes, and drives economic growth across the world,' Frank Fannon, the top U.S. energy diplomat, told Reuters.GAS GLUT, LNG SHORTAGERising crude prices have U.S. producers drilling for more oil than ever, with natural gas produced as a byproduct. While some of that gas is going into power generation - offsetting coal power even as Trump has promised to bail out struggling nuclear and coal plants - there is still more than is needed domestically.That has producers hoping for new export capacity.Globally, there has been a dearth of major go-ahead decisions on LNG projects since 2015, as sagging energy prices and worries over a looming glut left buyers hesitant.But the glut has not materialized and global demand has taken off, fanning fears of an LNG shortage instead. Gas trade rose 6.2 percent in 2017, according to a report by BP, with LNG demand up more than 10 percent in its best year since 2010.â€œThe needle is moving significantly, both on the supply and demand side,' said Eric Fell, an analyst with Genscape.That should smooth the path for deal-making at the four-day Washington conference, said industry players and analysts, despite the trade dispute with Beijing.The Asian superpower is not the only buyer in town, said Gregory Vesey, chief executive of LNG Ltd , which is developing the Magnolia LNG project in Louisiana.'All across Europe there are opportunities that are starting to feel very real,' he said, noting European gas prices are up, while U.S. LNG prices have stayed flat.(Reporting by Julie Gordon in Vancouver; Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner in Washington; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Matthew Lewis)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By Jane Chung and Tom WestbrookSEOUL/SYDNEY (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's planned tariffs on steel and aluminum risk retaliation from other economies and could cost jobs, Australia's trade minister said on Friday, while China predicted harm to trade if other countries follow the example of the United States.Fears of an escalating trade war roiled Asian markets, hitting the share prices of steelmakers and manufacturers supplying U.S. markets particularly hard.U.S. stock futures pointed to a steady start on Friday after a sharp fall following Trump's Thursday announcement.Trump said the duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum would be formally announced next week, although White House officials later said some details still needed to be ironed out.'The imposition of a tariff like this will do nothing other than distort trade and ultimately, we believe, will lead to a loss of jobs,' Australian trade minister Steven Ciobo told reporters in Sydney.'My concern remains that on the back of actions like this we could see retaliatory measures that are put in place by other major economies. That is in no-one's interest.'GRAPHIC: http://reut.rs/2F4MJ6TAustralia, which has championed the free-trade Trans Pacific Partnership that Trump pulled the United States out of, has sought an exemption for its steel and aluminum exports to the United States, Ciobo added.'All countries steel and aluminum industries are facing difficulties,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing in Beijing.'China urges the United States to show restraint in using protective trade measures, respect multilateral trade rules, and make a positive contribution to international trade order.'Steel has become a key focus for Trump, who pledged to restore the U.S. industry and punish what he sees as unfair trade practices, particularly by China.Although China only accounts for 2 percent of U.S. steel imports, its massive industry expansion has helped produce a global glut of steel that has driven down prices.'The impact on China is not big,â€? said Li Xinchuang, vice secretary-general of the China Iron and Steel Association. 'Nothing can be done about Trump. We are already numb to him.'South Korea, the third-largest steel exporter to the United States after Canada and Brazil, said it will keep talking to U.S. officials until Washington's plans for tariffs are finalised.'For us, the worst case scenario was a 54 percent tariff,' said a South Korean trade ministry official who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media.Nonetheless, if Trump pursues his proposal for a 25 percent global steel tariff, 'that will still affect our steel exports to the U.S,' the official added.Canada, Brazil and the EU said they would look to take action over the tariffs.NATIONAL SECURITY?Moody's Investors Service noted that steel and aluminum are not a major economic factor even for big Asian exporters, typically accounting for less than 1 percent of gross domestic product or exports.Asian steelmakers, however, do worry U.S. tariffs could result in their domestic markets becoming flooded with steel products that have nowhere else to go.â€œWe are concerned about how other exporters react, what will happen with steel that cannot be sold to the U.S.,â€? Vikrom Wacharakrup, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries' iron and steel industry group, told Reuters. Thailand exports steel mainly to Asia but also the United States.The Trump administration also cited national security interests for its action, saying the United States needs domestic supplies for its tanks and warships.Contrary to the action announced by Trump on Thursday, the Department of Defense had recommended targeted steel tariffs and a delay in aluminum duties.'We continue to seek clarification,' said Japanese Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko. 'I donâ€™t think exports of steel and aluminum from Japan, which is a U.S. ally, damages U.S. national security in any way, and we would like to explain that to the U.S.'India also raised concerns about the use of the U.S. national security interest provisions, under what is known as a Section 232 investigation.'We have only 2 percent of our exports to U.S. so no immediate dent, but validity of Section 232 is stretched to be used as a tariff barrier,' India's Steel Secretary Aruna Sharma told Reuters.Trump believes the tariffs will safeguard American jobs but many economists say the impact of price increases for consumers of steel and aluminum, such as the auto and oil industries, will be to destroy more jobs than they create.Japan's Toyota Motor Corp said the tariffs would substantially raise costs and therefore prices of cars and trucks sold in the United States.Asian share markets extended Thursday's rout on Wall Street. Japan's benchmark Nikkei Index dropped 2.5 percent.Asian steelmakers suffered, with South Korea's POSCO and Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp both down more than 3 percent.'The world stands on the brink of a trade war as Donald Trump announces severe tariffs on steel and aluminum - forget the yield curve - this is how recessions start,' said Robert Carnell, head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING in Singapore.'Trade is just about the only thing economists are agreed on - more is better,' he said.(Reporting by Jane Chung in SEOUL and Tom Westbrook in SYDNEY; Additional reporting by Christian Shepherd in BEIJING, Kaori Kaneko in TOKYO, Tom Daly in BEIJING, Minami Funakoshi, Chang-Ran Kim and Yuka Obayashi in TOKYO, Chayut Setboonsarng in BANGKOK and Neha Dasgupta in NEW DELHI; Writing by Lincoln Feast; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore and Richard Borsuk)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As fears of a global trade war escalate, all eyes will be on Beijing this weekend.US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is due to arrive in the Chinese capital on Saturday for talks with trade negotiators from the worldâ€™s second-biggest economy.The negotiations come after a rocky week during which the United States tore up a tentative trade truce with Beijing and hit Canada, Mexico and the European Union with big tariffs on metal imports. All three will retaliate.What are the talks about?Washington and Beijing have been exchanging threats for months, announcing plans for tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of each othersâ€™ exports.President Donald Trump wants China to engineer huge cuts in its $375 billion trade surplus in goods with its biggest trading partner.Related: Trumpâ€™s on-again, off-again strategy on China may backfireAt the last round of talks in Washington, China pledged to significantly boost its purchases of American goods and services.Senior US officials have said that during the Beijing visit, Ross will be seeking commitments on how that will happen in areas such as energy and agriculture.But experts are skeptical that the United States will be able to get China to do enough to significantly close the huge trade gap.Related: US-China trade battle: How we got hereOther big US demands may also be on the table.Speaking on Thursday, Ross said the objectives of the Trump administration hadnâ€™t changed.â€œOur basic objectives with China are to sell them more product, get less in the way of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers, and then ultimately, and most importantly â€¦ deal with the problems of intellectual property, technology transfers, the whole litany of high-tech things,â€? he told CNBC.The United States is pressing Beijing to move away from industrial policies that critics say subsidize Chinese companies on the global stage and pressure foreign firms to hand over key technologies.US officials are particularly concerned about â€œMade in China 2025,â€? which seeks to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into high-tech industries like robotics, electric cars and computing with the aim of becoming a global leader in those fields.Analysts say China is unlikely to budge on those plans, which it sees as crucial for developing its huge economy.What could go wrong?The Trump administration upped the stakes ahead of Rossâ€™ expected visit by saying Tuesday it planned to forge ahead with tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, as well as measures to restrict Chinese investment in the United States.The move was unexpected, as trade tensions appeared to have eased in recent weeks after both sides said they had agreed to put plans for tariffs on hold while they tried to make progress in negotiations.Related: 3 tough questions after US-China trade truceAnalysts at Oxford Economics suggested that the announcement was â€œaimed at renewing pressure on China ahead of the bilateral talks and the possible North Korea summit,â€? according to a research note this week.The Chinese government said the move went against the recent consensus between the two countries. It reiterated its stance that it doesnâ€™t want a trade war but isnâ€™t afraid of fighting one.But it has resisted announcing any retaliation so far. A US delegation arrived in Beijing on Wednesday for preliminary talks to establish the outlines for the weekend negotiations.China previously said it could strike back with tariffs on American goods such as soybeans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the U.S. and China ratchet up a tit-for-tat tariff dispute, it has been said often in the last few weeks: 'No one wins a trade war.'Nevertheless, staying out of a war is often the best way to win, or at least not to lose.Take Australia, for example. In the 1990s, as the Asian economic miracle was taking shape, Australian politicians worked hard to overcome the country's geographic and cultural distance from that region to position it on the economic front lines. And while the U.S. has pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, Australia is still part of the pact. Canberra has also forged a series of bilateral deals with its regional neighbors, including a China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.China is now Australia's largest trading partner. What's more, it produces many of the things that China also sources from the U.S. â€” exports that appear on Beijing's list of 128 U.S. goods that will see tariffs of 15 to 25 percent in retaliation for the Trump administration's decision to impose similar tariffs on aluminum and steel from China.To be sure, there is plenty of hand wringing in Sydney, Perth and Canberra over the looming cross-Pacific trade war. See here and here.Even so, individual sectors in Australia stand to gain, by increasing production and/or prices of some basic commodities to feed China's enormous appetite.WineA record-breaking 2017 for Australian wine exports saw an overall increase of 15 percent from the previous year to $2.56 billion. Exports to mainland China â€” Australia's single-largest wine export region â€” were up a whopping 63 percent, with a total value of $848 million, nearly twice as large as the U.S., which lands in the No. 2 spot.The Wine Spectator reports that while the U.S. exported around $80 million worth of wine to China last year, that was dwarfed by France, Australia and Chile, the latter two having free-trade agreements with Beijing 'which put them at a significant advantage.''Current Chinese customs duties for U.S. wines are 14 percent â€” the new tariffs increase that to 29 percent. Wines from Australia and Chile are charged customs duties of 0 percent. According to [the Wine Institute's Asia Director Christopher] Beros, these countries 'have relied heavily on exports for many years for their entire industries [and] have been aggressively marketing in China,' the Wine Spectator writes.'If U.S. wines are subjected to higher tariffs when imported into China, that would have a direct benefit to other suppliers into that rapidly growing market, especially France and Australia â€” the two largest suppliers of premium wines to China,' Kym Anderson, a professor of economics at the University of Adelaide in Australia and also executive director of the university's Wine Economics Research Center tells CNBC.Robert Koch, the CEO of the Wine Institute, is more direct: 'This new increased tariff will have a chilling effect on U.S. wine exports to one of the world's most important markets,' Koch tells CNBC. 'U.S. producers were already at a disadvantage to many foreign competitors, and this will only exacerbate that problem. We urge a swift resolution to this crisis before long-term damage is done to the U.S. wine industry.'Fruits and NutsJoel Nelsen, the president of the trade group California Citrus Mutual is quoted by member station KVPR as saying 'The market share that we've been trying to develop over the past several years becomes expendable and there's an opportunity for others to steal it.'One of the thieves, so to speak, might be â€“ you guessed it â€“ Australia, which is the biggest competitor to the U.S. fruit exports to China. The Australian Bureau of Statistics says 40 percent of the country's fruit already gets shipped off to China and Hong Kong.Meanwhile, as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported last year:'Tree nuts are Australia's largest and most valuable horticultural export, accounting for 45 per cent of horticultural goods sold overseas, and tipped to reach around $1 billion in net worth this financial year, according to industry projections. Australian tree nut exports to China have grown from $6 million in 2010-11 to $63 million in 2015-16, according to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences.'While sounding an otherwise negative note on the Sino-U.S. trade dispute, CMC Markets' chief market strategist Michael McCarthy told ABC that Australia (and New Zealand) 'have a reputation for pure foods.''An opportunity in global markets to insert those products into other markets could be an opportunity for Australian farmers,' he said.Scrap AluminumAmong the U.S. exports that China has targeted is scrap aluminum (think recycled aluminum drink cans) which is melted and reformed in Chinese furnaces. Beijing slapped a steep 25 percent tariff on U.S. exports.Australia, however, has seen its exports of such waste materials, including aluminum, rise sharply since the 1990s.According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 'In 2011-12 Australia's major trading partner for exported waste products was China which received 32% of the total value of Australia's waste exports.Australia's main waste export to China was waste metal ($602 million or 592,000 tonnes) which accounted for 31% of the value of all exported waste metals.'SteelThe opening salvo of President Trump's trade dispute with China came in the form of steel tariffs.In 2016, Australia was the world's leading exporter of coal, while the U.S. ranked fourth.Both countries are also top exporters of metallurgical â€” or met â€” coal, which is used in blast furnaces to produce steel. China uses all the met coal it can produce and still imports substantial amounts from abroad.With the U.S. imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel imports from China, Beijing might well decide to source more of its met coal from somewhere else.Australia seems most likely to gain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Import tariffs will be cut to 15 percent from 25 percent for most vehicles from July 1, the Ministry of Finance said on Tuesday, adding that this was part of efforts to open up China's markets and spur development of the local auto sector. A small number of imported trucks are taxed at 20 percent currently.Import tariffs for auto parts would be cut to 6 percent from mostly around 10 percent, the ministry said in a statement.The move will be a major boost to overseas carmakers, especially helping premium brands such as Germany's BMW, electric car maker Tesla Inc and Daimler Mercedes-Benz close a price gap on local rivals.'Benefits are huge for our business, especially Infiniti,' said a Yokohama-based executive at Nissan Motor Co Ltd referring to the Japanese firm's premium car brand.Another executive at the firm's Chinese joint venture said it was 'great news' but that the biggest beneficiaries would likely be German luxury carmakers, which also include Volkswagen Porsche and Audi brands.'That's just because of the volume of imported cars they sell,' the person said, asking not to be named.Nissan did no respond to a request for comment.Toyota Motor Corp said it would adjust retail prices for imported cars that benefited from the lower tariffs to provide Chinese consumers with 'competitive' products.BMW said it would look at its prices and said the move was a 'strong signal that China will continue to open up', while Audi said it welcomed the 'further liberalisation and opening' of the Chinese market.A Shanghai-based spokesman for Ford Motor said the U.S. carmaker welcomed the new tariff policies, but declined to comment further.China's high tariff on vehicles - versus a 2.5 percent U.S. levy - has been a key focus of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration amid a simmering trade standoff between Washington and Beijing.Trump has said the 25 percent tariff amounted to 'stupid trade', while auto industry leaders such as Tesla's Elon Musk have said that Chinese restrictions on foreign auto makers created a skewed playing field.China and the United States, however, made a breakthrough in trade talks after negotiations in Washington last week, stepping back from the brink of a global trade war and agreeing to hold further talks to boost U.S. exports to China.(Additional reporting by Beijing Monitoring Desk; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)By Adam Jourdan and Norihiko Shirouzu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Besides the escalated risk of a trade war, Trump's blistering personal attack on Trudeau poses domestic economic and political risks for the Canadian prime minister, who has stuck to a conciliatory stance in the face of U.S. threats on NAFTA and other bilateral trade cases.'PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, 'US Tariffs were kind of insulting' and he 'will not be pushed around.' Very dishonest & weak,' Trump tweeted as he flew to a Singapore summit on North Korea.The attack shattered any hope that Canada could avoid U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium or renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement by virtue of the charm, patience or measured response it has extended to Trump since he took office.Trudeau's office, reeling from the abrupt Trump reversal hours after the two men had joked and smiled their way through a fractious G7 meeting, said only that Trudeau had said nothing in his news conference that he hadn't said before.'Canadians are polite, we're reasonable, but we also will not be pushed around,' Trudeau had told reporters as he reiterated that Canada would retaliate against U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium, adding Trump's rationale had been insulting.While the two men have had several seemingly congenial meetings and phone calls since Trump took office, they could not be more different in terms of policy, with Trudeau a progressive liberal, outspoken on feminism and the merits of diversity and who was close to former president Barack Obama.Earlier in the day, Trudeau had sniped about Trump's late appearance at a women's empowerment breakfast, referring to 'stragglers'.Trump's about-face sparked dismay and anger among Canadian and American free trade advocates alike.'To our allies: bipartisan majorities of Americans remain pro-free trade, pro-globalisation & supportive of alliances based on 70 years of shared values. Americans stand with you, even if our president doesnâ€™t,' U.S. Republican Senator John McCain tweeted after Trump on Saturday.Trudeau's former foreign policy advisor, Roland Paris lashed out at the U.S. president.'Big tough guy once he's back on his airplane. Can't do it in person, and knows it, which makes him feel weak. So he projects these feelings onto Trudeau and then lashes out at him,' Paris tweeted.Trade experts who have watched Trump negotiate with tough words on Twitter before said the bark of Trump's tweets often exceeds the bite of his policy - but that this time, Canada might struggle to respond.'The rhetoric has far outpaced the implementation,' said Geoffrey Gertz, trade analyst with Brookings think tank in Washington. 'Now we might be at a turning point ... (Canadians are) a little bit at a loss right now to figure out what to do.'But while Trudeau's months-long effort to reach out to U.S. politicians and business leaders at every jurisdiction and level may not have won over Trump, it may pay dividends if Trump's attack finally spurs support from business groups or Congress.Republicans worry the dispute with Canada could become an issue in trade-dependent farm states ahead of November congressional elections.'There's some movement within Congress now to rein in Trump on trade policy,' Gertz said.During the summit, Trump had changed the photo on his Twitter page to the 'family photo' taken with other G7 leaders. Somewhere over the Atlantic, minutes after attacking Trudeau, he swapped that for a photo with soldiers saluting during the national anthem.(Additional reporting by David Ljunggren in LA MALBAIE, Quebec; Editing by Amran Abocar and Michael Perry)By Andrea Hopkins and Roberta Rampton",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The tariffs, which take effect on Monday, were announced late on Sunday by China's finance ministry and matched a list of possible tariffs on up to $3 billion in U.S. goods published by China on March 23.Soon after the announcement, an editorial in the widely read Global Times newspaper warned that if the United States had thought China would not retaliate or would only take symbolic countermeasures, it could 'say goodbye to that delusion'.'Even though China and the U.S. have not publicly said they are in a trade war, the sparks of such a war have already started to fly,' the newspaper said.The Ministry of Commerce said it was suspending its obligations to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to reduce tariffs on 120 U.S. goods, including fruit and ethanol. The tariffs on those products will be raised by an extra 15 percent.Eight other products, including pork and scrap aluminium, would now be subject to additional tariffs of 25 percent, it said, with the measures effective starting April 2.'China's suspension of its tariff concessions is a legitimate action adopted under WTO rules to safeguard China's interests,' the finance ministry said.China is moving swiftly with retaliatory action amid escalating trade tension with the United States, which has rocked global financial markets in the past week as investors fear a full-blown trade dispute between the two economic superpowers will damage world growth.In response to China's move, Washington said Beijing's subsidies and overcapacity were behind the action on steel.'Instead of targeting fairly traded U.S. exports, China needs to stop its unfair trading practices which are harming U.S national security and distorting global markets,â€? White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.MORE TARIFFS COMING FROM WASHINGTONU.S. President Donald Trump is separately preparing to impose tariffs of more than $50 billion on Chinese goods following an investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act.The U.S. administration says China has systematically misappropriated American intellectual property - allegations China denies.About the Section 301 investigation, China had 'yet to unsheathe its sword,' the official Xinhua news agency said.Sometime this week, the Trump administration is expected to unveil a list of Chinese goods that could be subjected to new U.S. tariffs.U.S. technology industry officials said they expected the list to target products that benefit from Beijing's 'Made in China 2025' program, which aims to upgrade the domestic manufacturing base with more advanced products.China has repeatedly promised to open its economy further, but many foreign companies complain of unfair treatment. China warned the United States on Thursday not to open a Pandora's Box and spark a flurry of protectionist practices across the globe.'There are some people in the West who think that China looks tough for the sake of a domestic audience, and would easily make concessions,' the Global Times said.'But they are wrong.'The Global Times is run by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, although its stance does not necessarily reflect government policy.Reaction to China's measures varied on social media, with some saying Chinese customers would be the ones to ultimately pay for a trade war.'Why not directly target soybean and planes? The tariffs that China announced today don't sound a lot to me,' said a user on the Weibo microblog platform.Aircraft and soybeans were China's biggest U.S. imports by value last year.In a statement published on Monday morning, the commerce ministry said the United States had 'seriously violated' the principles of nondiscrimination enshrined in World Trade Organization rules, and had also damaged China's interests.'China's suspension of some of its obligations to the United States is its legitimate right as a member of the World Trade Organization,' it said, adding that differences should be resolved through negotiation.Weibo prominently featured the list of U.S. goods that China is targeting among the day's 'hot' trending topics.'I will never buy fruit from the U.S.,' a Weibo user wrote.(Reporting by Ben Blanchard and Tony Munroe; additional reporting by David Stanway in Shanghai and Stella Qiu and Lusha Zhang in Beijing; additional Writing by Ryan Woo; editing by Eric Meijer, Shri Navaratnam and Jonathan Oatis)By Ben Blanchard and Tony Munroe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Asia's economic powerhouse has led a synchronized uptick in global growth over the past year and a half, led by solid exports and a booming construction sector, though Chinese policy makers have had to walk a tight rope between defusing financial risks and keeping output broadly stable.The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is seen down at 51.3 in April from 51.5 in March, according to the median forecast of 26 economists in a Reuters poll. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.Rising tensions between China and the United States threaten to hit billions of dollars in cross-border trade. Analysts say these risks seem to have encouraged some Chinese exporters to ship out goods in early 2018, helping bump up China's export numbers for January-February.Exports are expected to have rebounded in April from a weak March outcome, as shipments normalized thanks to still-solid global demand. [nL3N1RU1Z6]'We expect April economic indicators to have improved from March, particularly in exports where we are very likely to see a reversal of March's negative growth,' said Lisheng Wang, a Hong Kong-based economist at Nomura.Risks to growth, however, have risen in the wake of the U.S.-China trade dispute. While analysts say it is too early to gauge the potential fallout of the tariff standoff with the United States, a dent to business confidence could impinge on economic momentum.Indeed, while the economy has displayed remarkable resilience in 2017 and early this year, signs of stress have shown up in softer industrial demand, slower investment growth, and a subdued property market. This is backed up by expectations that weaker producer prices will have persisted in April in line with a broader cooling in output.[L3N1S23AA][nL3N1S23AA]Economists expect growth in the world's second-largest economy to ease to 6.5 percent this year, from 6.9 percent in 2017, with a regulatory crackdown on the country's finance sector and the Sino-U.S. trade row seen as key risks, a Reuters poll showed. [nL3N1RU2FP]Separately, a private survey on China's factory activity for April is forecast to show a similar easing trend as the official reading.The private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) is expected to have eased to 50.8 in April versus 51 in March.The official PMI survey is due out on April 30, along with a similar official survey on services.The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on May 2, and the Caixin services PMI on May 4.(Reporting by Stella Qiu and Ryan Woo; Polling by Wang Jing and Shaloo Shrivastava; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Known in Chinese government circles as 'the firefighter' for his central role in tackling issues like corruption and domestic financial problems, Wang also has experience dealing with the United States - leading annual economic talks with Washington when he was a vice premier.As a result, Wang had been tipped by foreign diplomats to take a central position in handling U.S. President Donald Trump's administration when he became vice president.These expectations had been heightened when prior to his appointment in March, Wang had private meetings with U.S. ambassador to China Terry Branstad, and with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. He also held closed-door meetings with U.S. executives in recent months, sources in the U.S. business community say.But aside from the occasional public meeting with U.S. visitors - the last time was in mid-May when he met U.S. business executives in Beijing - and the odd appearance elsewhere, including at a forum in Russia in late May, Wang has kept a low profile.The week before last, for example, the only news he appeared to make was when he met Bangladesh's foreign minister and when he was appointed honorary president of the Chinese Red Cross.For some China watchers his absence is a bad omen for the state of Sino-U.S. relations despite Trump's continued insistence that Xi is a close friend. If there was going to be a breakthrough in the trade row anytime soon then they would expect Wang to be taking a more prominent role.'Wang Qishan would be crazy to get on a plane until there were far greater assurances there is a deal to be had and the deal would stick,' said Scott Kennedy, deputy director of the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.TRUMP'S LATEST THREATOne source with knowledge of Wang's meetings with U.S. business leaders said the vice president is only going to get involved when 'he can have a clear view of how he can negotiate a solid outcome.' When there is something to be negotiated, Wang will probably insert himself in some way, this person said.Neither the foreign ministry nor the cabinet's spokesman's office responded to a request for comment on Wang and his role in the U.S. trade dispute. There is no public contact information for the vice president's office.The last round of trade talks with Washington, led for China by Vice Premier Liu He, failed to head off a U.S. decision to impose punitive tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports on Friday, with another $16 billion of goods to be targeted in a second phase. China retaliated with its own increased tariffs on $34 billion (Â£25.54 billion) of U.S. imports to China.Perhaps most worrying of all for China, Trump warned the U.S. administration may ultimately target more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, or roughly the total amount that the United States imported from China last year.China has indicated it will respond with its own measures against the U.S. each time Washington ratchets up the tariffs.Wang's diplomacy has been low-key and behind the scenes, and there is no sign he has lost his status as a key decision maker and political player, diplomats say.A smoker who is 70 this month, Wang is more senior than both the Chinese government's most senior diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, and Politburo member Yang Jiechi, who heads the Communist Party's foreign affairs commission.Unlike the urbane, Harvard-educated Vice Premier Liu, Wang does not speak English, though he has a penchant for no-nonsense, direct talk behind closed doors, those who have seen him in action say.CLOSE TO XIA senior Western diplomat said Beijing appeared to be reluctant for Wang to get involved after Liu had the rug pulled out from under him by Trump's reneging on a previously agreed 'consensus' to resolve the trade spat in May.Wang is extremely close to President Xi Jinping and reports directly to him, meaning if a similar thing had happened to Wang it would be seen as a personal snub to Xi, the diplomat said.'You can embarrass the vice premier but not the vice president,' the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Beijing has struggled to work out what Washington really wants, especially given the U.S. trade negotiating team has been split between those who tend to favour free trade and those who are more protectionist, a source with ties to the Chinese leadership told Reuters. This has led to confusing and sometimes contradictory statements from different officials.'It's reneging on one's words,' said the source, quoting a saying attributed to ancient Chinese philosopher Mencius that state media has increasingly used to refer to the U.S. administration's struggle to give a single unified message.(Reporting by Michael Martina and Ben Blanchard; Editing by Martin Howell)By Ben Blanchard and Michael Martina",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Describing the dumping of steel and aluminum in the U.S. market as 'an assault on our country,' Trump said in a White House announcement that the best outcome would for companies to move their mills and smelters to the United States. He insisted that domestic metals production was vital to national security.'If you don't want to pay tax, bring your plant to the USA,' added Trump, flanked by steel and aluminum workers.Plans for the tariffs, set to start in 15 days, have stirred opposition from business leaders and prominent members of Trump's own Republican Party, who fear the duties could spark retaliation from other countries and hurt the U.S. economy.Within minutes of the announcement, U.S. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, a Trump critic, said he would introduce a bill to nullify the tariffs. But that would likely require Congress to muster an extremely difficult two-thirds majority to override a Trump veto.Some Democrats praised the move, including Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who said it was 'past time to defend our interests, our security and our workers in the global economy and that is exactly what the president is proposing with these tariffs.'Trump's unexpected announcement of the tariffs last week roiled stock markets as it raised the prospect of an escalating global trade war. He appeared to have conceded some ground after concerted lobbying by Republican lawmakers, industry groups and U.S. allies abroad.Canada, the largest supplier of both steel and aluminum to the United States, welcomed the news it would not immediately be subject to the tariffs, but vowed to keep pressing Washington until the threat of tariffs had disappeared.Trump offered relief from steel and aluminum tariffs to countries that 'treat us fairly on trade,' a gesture aimed at putting pressure on Canada and Mexico to give ground in separate talks on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement.Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said NAFTA talks were 'independent' of Trump's tariff actions and should not be subject to outside pressure.In Beijing, China's Commerce Ministry said on Friday it 'resolutely opposed' the tariffs and that they would 'seriously impact the normal order of international trade.'While Chinese steel exports to the United States have been suppressed by previous anti-dumping duties, the broad 'Section 232' national security tariffs are widely seen as aiming to pressure Beijing to cut excess steel and aluminum production capacity that has driven down global prices.U.S. steel stocks, which have gained for weeks on anticipation of the tariffs, fell after the announcement, with the Standard and Poor's composite steel index <.SPCOMSTEEL> ending down 2.53 percent against a half percent gain in the broad S&P 500 <.SP500> index.Century Aluminum shares fell 7.5 percent, while Alcoa dipped 0.9 percent. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso gained slightly against the U.S. dollar.SEEKING CLARITYA senior Trump administration official said other countries could seek talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to find 'alternative ways' to mitigate the threat to U.S. national security posed by their steel and aluminum exports to the United States.It was unclear whether they would involve quotas or voluntary export restraints, but the official said that permanent exemptions for Canada and Mexico might result in higher tariffs on other countries to maintain 80 percent capacity usage targets for domestic producers.European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said: 'The EU is a close ally of the U.S. and we continue to be of the view that the EU should be excluded from these measures. I will seek more clarity on this issue in the days to come.'U.S. steel- and aluminum-consuming industries sharply criticized the tariffs as damaging them with higher costs.'The U.S. will become an island of high steel prices that will result in our customers simply sourcing our products from our overseas competitors and importing them into the United States tariff-free,' the Precision Metalforming and National Tooling and Machining associations said in a joint statement.COUNTERMEASURES?Several major trading partners have said they might respond to the tariffs with direct action.Countermeasures could include European Union tariffs on U.S. oranges, tobacco and bourbon. Harley-Davidson Inc motorcycles have also been mentioned, targeting Republican U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan's home state of Wisconsin.Even as Trump threatened tariffs and prodded his NAFTA partners, 11 nations gathered in Chile to sign a landmark Asia-Pacific trade pact, one that Trump withdrew from on his first day in office last year.Trump, who won the White House after a career in real estate and reality TV, has long touted economic nationalism, promising to bring back jobs to the United States and save the country from trade deals he views as unfair. That has put him at odds with many in his Republican Party, traditionally a supporter of free trade.(For a graphic on 'Global trade and GDP growth' click http://reut.rs/2FtPzhW)(For a graphic on 'U.S. visible trade balance' click http://reut.rs/2Fmon8N)(For a graphic on 'U.S. steel imports by country' click http://reut.rs/2Fkjb5g)(Additional reporting by Antonio De la Jara and Dave Sherwood in Santiago, Michael Martina, Elias Glenn, Kim Coghill, Brian Love, Nichola Saminather, Doina Chiacu and Andrea Hopkins; Writing by David Stamp, David Chance and David Lawder; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney)By David Lawder and Jeff Mason",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Luxury carmakers Daimler and BMW joined American farmers and Chinese solar panel and steel makers among the first casualties in what looks set to become a bitter trade war on a global scale of a kind not seen since the 1930s.While most economists believe a tariff war between the world's two largest economies will not derail global growth even if U.S. President Donald Trump follows through with duties on $450 billion of imports from China, individual industries such as agriculture, autos and technology look set to be hit hard.Daimler on Wednesday cut its 2018 profit forecast while BMW, whose Spartanburg, South Carolina plant is the largest single exporter of vehicles in the United States, said it was looking at 'strategic options' because of the threatened trade war.The first test of whether a tariff war will indeed start comes on July 6, the date on which Trump has threatened to enact the first portion of duties on a planned $50 billion of imports from China.Beijing has pledged retaliation and Trump has threatened to push harder in response, saying that there could be tariffs on up to $450 billion of imports from China, close to the $500 billion of goods the United States gets from the world's second largest economy.A trade war between the United States, which is mired in battles with allies in Europe and North America over trade, immigration and foreign policy, and China, the world's emerging economic and military power, now looks as if it will involve the entire world if both sides follow through on their threats.'It is deeply regrettable that the U.S. has been capricious, escalated the tensions, and provoked a trade war,' Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said on Thursday.'The U.S. is accustomed to holding 'big sticks' for negotiations, but this approach does not apply to China.'At the same time as Gao and Chinese newspapers stressed that Beijing would strike back, President Xi Jinping told foreign company executives in Beijing that he was pressing ahead with promised tariff reductions promised in April.Items such as cars have seen pledges of cuts and in May, Beijing said it would lower import tariffs on 1,449 consumer goods, starting from July 1.Beijing has sought to portray itself as the guardian of global free trade, a crown that has been abandoned by the United States since Trump took office in 2017 with his protectionist agenda.'I've been honoring my words with actions,' Xi told a group of foreign chief executives in Beijing on Thursday.Although there has been no record of talks between the two countries since a deal to negotiate a reduction in America's trade deficit with China fell apart, some political analysts in the United States believe Trump may pull away from the tariffs before July 6.The continued harsh rhetoric from Washington appeared to cast doubt on that, however.'What we have to do is create an environment where it's more painful for these parties that have these huge trade barriers, both tariff and non-tariff; got to make it more painful for them to keep those barriers than to get rid of them,' U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told broadcaster CNBC on Thursday.Financial markets have been hit harder with the rise in threats, and car companies felt the brunt of that on Thursday, even though companies like General Motors and Ford Motor rebounded from earlier stock price lows.GM closed almost 2 percent lower on Thursday while Ford lost 1.3 percent and Tesla plunged 4.1 percent.FEELING IT IN THE FIELDSA trade war would hit U.S. farmers, a vast majority of whom supported Trump in the 2016 election.Adding to the woes of soy farmers, who have seen the value of their commodity fall to multi-year lows, pork farmers were set to feel the heat from China as well.China implemented a 25 percent duty on most U.S. pork items on April 2, and a 15 percent tariff on a range of fruits and nuts, in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum products.Last week pork was included in a second round of tariffs to be imposed on July 6. No other products have been listed twice and it now faces cumulative import duties of 71 percent, not including value added tax, according to a formula published on the website of China's finance ministry last week.Chinese shares fell 1.2 percent on Thursday on investor worries about the trade dispute, with the Shanghai index languishing at a two-year low.China has said it would impose additional tariffs on 659 U.S. goods, with duties on 545 to kick in on July 6, after Trump said Washington would levy tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese products.Beijing has yet to set a tariff activation date for the remaining 114 U.S. products, which include crude oil, coal and a host of refined fuel products.Some Chinese economists have said that while Beijing cannot agree to Trump's excessive demands, some of the issues raised by Washington could be implemented and would, over the longer term, benefit China.'We cannot be soft with Trump. He is using his 'irrationality' as a tactic and he is trying to confuse us,' said Chen Fengying, an economics expert at state-backed China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations.'But if we could accomplish some of the things that he wants us to do - such as IP (intellectual property), market reforms, he'd be helping us. Of course there are risks, those would depend on how we handle those reforms.'(Additional reporting by Se Young lee and Ben Blanchard in BEIJING and Divya Chowdhury in MUMBAI; Writing by Ryan Woo and David Chance; Editing by James Dalgleish)By Doina Chiacu, Edward Taylor and Yawen Chen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"plummeted on Friday as China and the United States moved closer to a trade war that could damage global growth.Shares in machinery makers, which account for 20 percent of Japan's total exports, had enjoyed strong gains in the past year on the back of brisk demand for investment in electronics and semiconductors in China, Japan's biggest trading partner.U.S. President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday that will target up to $60 billion in Chinese goods with tariffs to kick in after a 30-day consultation period. The tariffs would target sectors including technology.'Responding to rising demand for tech products in China, Japan's capital goods makers and machinery makers had seen strong exports so they are likely to hit hard from now,' said Shogo Maekawa, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.The Tokyo machinery sector index <.IMCHN.T> slumped 5.6 percent, helping to pull the Nikkei share average <.N225> down 4.5 percent.Machine tool makers were hammered, with Makino Milling Machine sliding 6.1 percent, Okuma Corp nose-diving 7.4 percent and DMG Mori Co stumbling 6.0 percent.Since the beginning of the year, Makino has fallen 15 percent, while Okuma and DMG Mori have both sunk around 20 percent.The Cabinet Office last week said it expects a 3.1 percent drop in Japan's exports, the first decline in a year.'For the Japanese economy which relies heavily on external demand amid weak domestic demand, this signals an end to strong exports,' said Toru Suehiro, a senior market economist at Mizuho Securities.Friday's big losers included semiconductor equipment makers Advantest and Tokyo Electron 8035.T dropped 4.1 percent and 5.7 percent, respectively.High-purity silicon maker Sumco Corp also shed 5.0 percent and silicon products maker Shin-Etsu Chemical Co <4063.> tumbled 6.7 percent.Construction equipment maker Komatsu tumbled 6.3 percent.(This story corrects paragraph 8 timeframe to a year, not five quarters.)(Reporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Kim Coghill)By Ayai Tomisawa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jan. 13 --President Donald Trump's imminent decision to impose trade protections on solar panels will have repercussions in Butte , according to REC Silicon company officials.More than 300 of REC Silicon's employees, including those in Butte , signed a letter sent to the White House this week. The letter requests that Trump negotiate with China to re-open the doors for the solar panel industry.A trade war began with China over materials used to make solar panels under the Obama administration in 2014. This has had repercussions for REC Silicon , bringing production levels at its Moses Lake, Washington , plant down to 50 percent and leading to rounds of layoffs, said Francine Sullivan , vice president of business development, from Washington D.C. Thursday. REC Silicon's Moses Lake plant manufactures solar-grade polysilicon, which is used to manufacture solar panels.The Butte -based REC Silicon plant, in the Montana Connections Business Development Park southwest of Butte , has also been affected by the trade war. Though the Butte plant manufactures electronic-grade polysilicon for the electronics industry, it laid off about 30 employees last fall, bringing its number of workers down to around 200.Now, Trump is considering imposing tariffs on solar panel imports. If Trump imposes those tariffs, it would escalate the trade war with China and hurt the solar-grade polysilicon market, say REC Silicon company officials.'With your upcoming decision, you have a unique opportunity to create a comprehensive trade win for U.S. interests -- including both U.S. producers of solar (panels) as well as producers of polysilicon,' REC Silicon employees wrote in the letter to Trump.The White House neither confirmed if it got the letter nor did it respond to The Montana Standard's questions. However, a White House spokesperson via email said several trade-related statutory deadlines are approaching and that announcements would be forthcoming.Last summer, the U.S. International Trade Commission began an investigation into the trade war with China . The commission concluded last fall that solar panels imported into the U.S. are 'a substantial cause of serious injury ... to the domestic industry.' By statute, the president has 60 days to take action on the commission's report. Trump is expected to make that decision soon.The REC Silicon letter says the company and the industry 'have been devastated' by the trade war.' China has blocked our exports from the Chinese market, which represents 80 percent of the global demand,' the letter states.Norway -based REC Silicon invested $1.7 billion in 2010 in the Moses Lake plant, according to the letter and company officials. The letter says the Moses Lake and Butte plants previously employed more than 900 workers combined.But due to rounds of layoffs at Moses Lake , its numbers are down to around 230 workers.' Butte production is not down,' Sullivan told the Standard. 'But the whole company is under enormous pressure. There's not enough buffer in the company for Butte to not be completely unaffected.'Sullivan said that both the electronics and the solar markets are growing. If the trade war comes to an end with Trump's imminent action, the company can 'get back to business.''We have expansion opportunities for both plants we can't execute on,' Sullivan said of the current situation. 'There are lots of things we'd like to do, but with no money to do those things. ... Butte would definitely benefit, and we would grow there.'REC Silicon also sent a copy of the letter to Gov. Steve Bullock , a Democrat, Republican Sen. Steve Daines , Democrat Sen. Jon Tester , and Republican Congressman Greg Gianforte .All of Montana's top elected officials voiced support for REC Silicon .Bullock sent his own letter to Washington D.C. officials in December, stating that 'finding an agreement and settling this trade dispute is a potential win for the U.S. and China .'Daines, through his press secretary, wrote that he is 'strongly urging the administration to resolve this trade dispute quickly and in a way that protects America's interests and jobs.'Tester, through his press secretary, wrote that 'the workers at REC Silicon produce a world-class product.'This administration has talked about providing American businesses with a fair shake, well now it is time to deliver ... now we have an opportunity to protect hundreds of good paying jobs by striking a deal to restore their access to the world's largest market,' Tester wrote.Gianforte also weighed in, through his press secretary, by saying in writing that 'solar trade disputes should be handled in a comprehensive manner that addresses harmful trade practices and protects American silicon producers, like REC Silicon , from retaliation.'Sullivan said Trump could turn things around.'We are asking that Trump take advantage of this opportunity to solve the trade war. It's an opportunity to incentivize the Chinese to relieve the duties,' Sullivan said.___(c)2018 The Montana Standard (Butte, Mont.)Visit The Montana Standard (Butte, Mont.) at www.mtstandard.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON â€“ As he blitzed through the industrial Midwest as a presidential candidate, Donald Trump pitched himself as the saviour of the â€œforgottenâ€? men and women in communities where factories had been shuttered and jobs were moved overseas.Now, Trump is risking a trade war to fulfil a political promise to the voters who helped put him in the White House.His decision to levy stiff new tariffs on aluminum and steel imports puts him at odds with most of the Republican Party, prominent business groups and even some of his own advisers, who warn that the decision could backfire and slow economic growth in a midterm election year. According to economic analysts, some of the communities that would be hardest hit by a trade standoff could be the same ones the president says heâ€™s aiming to help.Yet those arguments had little resonance with Trump during the fiery battle over tariffs that has played out in the West Wing in recent days. Having overcome the opposition, Trump relished Thursdayâ€™s signing ceremony, where he was flanked by steelworkers â€” some carrying their hard hats â€” who lavished praise on his decision.â€œIâ€™m delivering on a promise I made during the campaign,â€? Trump said. Gesturing to the workers, Trump said part of the reason heâ€™s in the White House was â€œbecause of you and my message having to do with you.â€?Notably, no Republican lawmakers attended the White House event.Current and former White House officials often describe the president as being preoccupied with keeping campaign promises to his loyal supporters, even if those decisions are unpopular with a broader swath of Americans. In public and in private, Trump still speaks frequently of his victories 16 months ago in Democratic-leaning states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, where working-class white voters helped propel him to victory. Heâ€™ll likely need to carry those states again if he hopes to win re-election in 2020.In Pennsylvania, both the Republican and Democratic candidate running in next weekâ€™s House special election endorsed the broad outlines of the presidentâ€™s approach on tariffs during a recent debate. Trump plans to campaign for Republican Rick Saccone on Saturday.However, most GOP lawmakers have balked at Trumpâ€™s approach, which includes exemptions for Mexico and Canada and the opportunity for other countries to appeal for a similar reprieve. And like the president, Republicans are making political calculations in doing so. Having made little progress in Congress on several GOP priorities, Republican candidates have been banking on a strong economy and the growing popularity of the partyâ€™s tax overhaul to combat a Democratic electorate energized by its disdain for Trump.But lawmakers fear a trade war could wipe away economic gains and leave them on shaky ground with voters in November.Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin called the tariffs â€œa very risky actionâ€? that could put agricultural and manufacturing jobs in his state and across the country at risk.â€œIâ€™m not sure there are any winners in trade wars,â€? said Johnson, who ran a plastics manufacturing business in Wisconsin before being elected to the Senate. â€œThere may be people who lose less.â€?House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is also from Wisconsin, issued a rare statement publicly breaking with the president. â€œI disagree with this action and fear its unintended consequences,â€? he said.Even before entering politics, Trump the businessman and real estate developer railed against what he viewed as unfair trade practices that left the U.S. economy and American workers vulnerable. Those viewpoints became the centerpiece of his presidential campaign, and he vowed to not only slap tougher tariffs on exports, but also withdraw the United States from multilateral free trade agreements with allies in Asia and North America.Hours before the president signed an executive order implementing the new tariffs, trade ministers from 11 Pacific Rim countries signed a sweeping free trade agreement the U.S. had been part of until Trump withdrew last year. The agreement was negotiated by Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration, but had broad support from GOP leaders who have long backed multilateral free trade pacts.Economic analysts warn that a trade dispute sparked by the tariffs could damage communities that backed the president in 2016. An analysis by Brookings Institution last year showed that areas that voted for Trump are more dependent on exports, which foreign countries could target in retaliation. Exports account for more than half of the local economy in Columbus, Indiana, and 25 per cent of Fond du Lac, Wisconsinâ€™s economy.The economic data mattered little Thursday to Dustin Stevens, a superintendent at Century Aluminum Potline in Hawesville, Kentucky, who attended the White House event.â€œMy father worked in the industry, and worked at that plant for 40 years,â€? Stevens said. â€œSo this hits home for all of us.â€?___Associated Press writers Josh Boak in Washington and Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, contributed to this report.__Editorâ€™s Note: Julie Pace has covered the White House and politics for the AP since 2007.

"Andrew Mayeda by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is considering a trip to China amid a trade dispute with Beijing that finance chiefs warn could derail the global economic upswing. Mnuchin said on Sunday (AEST) that he was 'cautiously optimistic' of reaching an agreement with China that bridges their differences over trade. 'A trip is under consideration,' Mnuchin told reporters in Washington at the IMF's spring meetings. 'I'm not going to make a comment on timing, nor do I have anything confirmed.' China's Ministry of Commerce said on Sunday it had received a request from the US for a visit to Beijing to negotiate economic and trade issues, and that it welcomed such a move.A visit by the US Treasury secretary to China could signal a breakthrough in the spat between the world's two-biggest economies, whose threats to slap tariffs on each other have rattled markets and raised fears of a trade war. It would come at a sensitive time for the region's geopolitics, with negotiations under way on a planned meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. AdvertisementMnuchin's remarks came as finance ministers and central bankers at the IMF meetings gave their latest economic assessments, often citing trade as a threat looming over the strongest upswing in seven years. Global growth has strengthened and is increasingly broad based, the IMF's main advisory committee said at the weekend. However, it noted that 'rising financial vulnerabilities, increasing trade and geopolitical tensions, and historically high global debt threaten global growth prospects'. IMF First Deputy Managing Director David Lipton summed up the main takeaway he heard from officials at the meetings throughout last week as 'time's are good but it's getting risky'. Mnuchin said he met with Yi Gang, governor of the People's Bank of China, at the IMF gathering. The discussions focused on issues related to the Chinese central bank, not trade, said the secretary. Mnuchin said they also discussed China's planned further opening of some markets, a move that US has encouraged and 'appreciated'.'China will vigorously push forward the reform and opening-up of the financial sector, significantly relax market access restrictions, create a more attractive investment environment, strengthen the protection of intellectual properties and actively expand imports,' Yi said in a statement on Saturday. China has announced plans to gradually remove foreign ownership caps for limits for car-, ship- and aircraft-makers. Mnuchin said China had been 'very helpful' in supporting US sanctions against North Korea, and he welcomed Kim's suspension of nuclear weapons testing that was announced the day earlier. 'We are going to continue the sanctions' and a 'maximum pressure' campaign until North Korea abandons its nuclear-weapons program in a verifiable way, he said. Mnuchin indicated he's involved in a 'dialogue' with the Chinese government to resolve the trade dispute. 'We're cautiously optimistic to see if we can try to reach an agreement,' he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Share on twitterShare on Google Plus John Kehoe by Why has US President Donald Trump suddenly backed away, at least temporarily, from threatening a trade war against China? North Korea was probably a material factor. In just three weeks, Trump is due to hold a historic meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un in Singapore on June 12. Waging a trade war with China, North Korea's estranged ally, would have hurt Trump's chances of receiving necessary cooperation from China's President Xi Jinping on trying to terminate Pyongyang's nuclear weapons.US Treasury Secretary announced Monday AEST the US was putting 'on hold' tariffs threatened on $US150 billion of Chinese goods. In exchange Beijing vaguely agreed to buy more American agriculture and energy exports. AdvertisementJoshua Meltzer, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and former Australian trade diplomat in Washington, says it's 'back to talks' between the US and China on trade. 'It's likely to drag on' 'It's likely to drag on and I don't expect to see anything concrete on trade before we see a possible outcome with North Korea,' Meltzer says. 'There may be some simple Chinese purchases of US agriculture and energy products, but absolutely nothing substantial on reforming China's state subsidies, state-owned enterprises, cyber theft and intellectual property.'Last week North Korea threatened to quit the planned Trump-Kim summit due to joint US-South Korea military exercises around the Korean peninsula. Kim has met Xi twice in the last two months, presumably to coordinate tactics heading into the Trump-Kim meeting. Trump hinted in the Oval Office last week that China's Xi might have been behind Pyongyang getting cold feet. 'If you remember two weeks ago, all of a sudden out of nowhere Kim Jong-un went to China to say hello again â€“ second time â€“ to President Xi,' Trump said before the US-China weekend trade talks.'It could very well be that he's influencing Kim Jong-un. We'll see what happens.' The canny Xi surely knew North Korea could be a tacit â€“ even if unspoken â€“ bargaining chip in US trade negotiations. It's a valuable lesson for Trump It's a valuable lesson for Trump that the world is multi-dimensional and much more complex than his earlier simplistic zero-sum, bilateral prism.Trump's hardline tactics appear to have forced China to go some way to meet his demand to cut America's bilateral trade deficit by $US200 billion. China won't commit to such a spurious number, but has vaguely promised to buying significantly more US exports. If a US-China mini-trade deal can be sealed in coming weeks or months, financial markets will be relieved, as will the rest of the world. Trump will be able to boast of helping farmers and manufacturers. In some ways it will be more a symbolic win, rather than a massive breakthrough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"China - US trade warThe trade war between the US and China has intensified. On September 17, the US announced its decision to move forward with tariffs on approximately $200 billion per year worth of imports from China.These tariffs will initially be set at 10% and will come into effect on September 24, but will increase to 25% on January 1, 2019. The list of products that the US will target includes a series of finished products containing leather, including luggage, bags, gloves, belts and wallets. Some furniture and car seats will also be included, although leather footwear will not (for now, at least).In response, China has announced it will retaliate by targeting imports from the US worth $60 billion per year. It published a list of targeted products in August. Most US hides and wet blue will be subject to 5% tariffs, although calf skins and some other skins will be subject to 25% tariffs. Like those imposed by the US, these tariffs will take effect on September 24.Report courtesy of Leatherbiz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Volkswagen cars are lifted inside a delivery tower at a plant in Wolfsburg, Germany. New U.S. tariffs on metals from the European Union and other allies have given rise to threats of retaliation.WASHINGTON -- If a trade war is coming, the cheese-makers of Wisconsin are standing in the line of fire. So are the farmers of the Great Plains and the distillers of Kentucky. And the employees of well-known American brands like Harley-Davidson and Levi Strauss.The likelihood of a trade conflagration leapt closer to reality this week after the United States imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Infuriated, the jilted U.S. allies vowed to retaliate with tariffs of their own. And in a separate dispute, China is poised to penalize $50 billion in U.S. goods -- many of them produced by supporters of President Donald Trump in the America's agricultural heartland.'They're going to hit the farmers,' said Bryan Klabunde, a farmer in northwestern Minnesota. 'We want things fair for all industries, but we're going to take the brunt of the punishment if other countries retaliate.'Trump, who entered office promising to rip up trade deals and crack down on unfair trading practices, is clashing with trading partners on all sides. To the north, he's taking on Canada; to the south, Mexico; to the east, Europe; across the Pacific Ocean to the west, China and Japan.'The president seems to be creating trade [and other] disputes with everyone -- allies and adversaries alike -- and it's difficult to discern any coherent strategy,' said Rod Hunter, a former National Security Council staff member under President George W. Bush. 'The impacts of the disputes have been limited so far, but the economic and political costs will go up as retaliation by trading partners begins in earnest.'Mexico, for instance, plans to retaliate against the steel and aluminum tariffs by targeting U.S. cheese, among other products.'It's our second-largest market,' Jeff Schwager, president of Sartori, a cheese company in Plymouth, Wis., said of Mexico. Retaliatory tariffs 'will reduce sales -- there's no question.'The EU is threatening to penalize Kentucky bourbon and the motorcycles of Wisconsin-based Harley-Davidson. The potential tariffs pack a political punch: They'd hurt constituents of House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.On Friday, reporters in Louisville, Ky., asked McConnell if he thought the Europeans were trying to get his attention.'Well,' the Senate leader said, 'they got my attention. They didn't need to do that. These are our friends. These are not enemies. Canada and Mexico, Europe -- these are our allies, and we need to work this out in a way that's comforting to everyone.'Ben Steffen, a dairy farmer who also grows corn, soybeans, and wheat on 1,900 acres in southeastern Nebraska near Humboldt, is angry about the U.S. tariffs being imposed on America's closest trade partners and allies.'I'm upset because it hits me in my pocketbook from multiple angles,' he said. 'I sell beef, I sell corn, I sell soybeans and I sell milk. All of those products are vulnerable because we export significant amounts in those markets.'The milk market has been depressed for about three years, and farmers have struggled to break even. About 14 percent of U.S. milk production is exported; the largest customer is Mexico.'This is the worst possible thing to have for our milk market, and it's the same for every other commodity,' Steffen said. ' These are important relationships.'An even higher-stakes trade dispute is playing out on the Pacific Rim. The United States and China are poised to impose tariffs on up to $200 billion worth of each other's goods in a battle over Beijing's strong-arm efforts to overtake U.S. technological supremacy.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is traveling to Beijing this weekend for talks aimed at preventing an all-out trade war between the world's two biggest economies. On the Chinese target list are American soybean farmers, who send about 60 percent of their exports to China.On Friday, Klabunde, who grows corn and soybeans on 3,000 acres near Waubun, Minn., spent two nerve-wracking hours with a hired hand, pulling a stuck tractor out of a drainage ditch. They finally got the machine free.'I think the tariffs and trade war scare me more than a stuck planter,' Klabunde said. 'I can lose only so much money on a stuck planter. I can lose a lot more money in a trade war.'Also Friday, Trump said he 'wouldn't mind' pursuing separate trade deals with Canada and Mexico in lieu of the North America Free Trade Agreement.'These are two very different countries,' Trump told reporters at the White House. 'But I wouldn't mind seeing a separate deal with Canada, where you have one type of product, so to speak, and a separate deal with Mexico.'Trump went on to say the U.S. loses 'a lot of money with Canada' and 'a fortune with Mexico' and that while he loved both countries, they took 'advantage of us economically.' He singled out Mexico for attracting U.S. auto manufacturers and Canada for restrictions on American agriculture imports.Information for this article was contributed by Paul Wiseman, Steve Karnowski, Carrie Antlfinger, Bruce Schreiner and David Pitt of The Associated Press and by Justin Sink of Bloomberg News.Business on 06/02/2018",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"File - In this May 16, 2018, file photo, President Donald Trump listens to a question during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. Trump says he'll demand that the Justice Department review whether it or the FBI infiltrated his campaign and whether any demands came from the Obama administration. Trump tweeted Sunday, May 20: 'I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes.' (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)WASHINGTON â€” President Donald Trump on Monday praised his administration's temporary truce with China on trade, even as his Treasury secretary and China struck a note of caution on the latest agreement.After high-level talks in Washington last week, Beijing has agreed to 'substantially reduce' America's trade deficit with China.'On China, Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time,' Trump tweeted.Farmers, he promises, will come out on top.'Under our potential deal with China, they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce,' he tweeted.Both sides, however, have said there are no guarantees trade tensions are over. China hasn't said how much it's willing to reduce the U.S. trade gap. The Trump administration had sought to slash the deficit by $200 billion.Also left unclear is the issue of intellectual property. The U.S. has long accused Beijing of secretly stealing U.S. technology from American businesses. Treasury Security Steven Mnuchin said Monday those issues 'are part of our framework. These things cannot be fixed overnight.'Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has been part of the U.S. negotiating team, is expected to go to China soon to follow up on last week's discussions.A day after declaring the trade war 'on hold,' Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday that Trump is reserving the right to reimpose tariffs against Chinese goods if the two countries can't agree on specifics to bring down the massive trade deficit with Beijing.Likewise, China's foreign ministry said details still have to be worked out.'Given the increasing interaction between the two countries, we cannot assure you they will not encounter more frictions or disputes in the future,' said spokesman Lu Kang.Last year, the U.S. had a record $376 billion deficit with China in the trade of goods; that was the largest by far with any nation.Mnuchin has said to expect to see a big increase â€” 35 percent to 45 percent this year alone â€” in U.S. farm sales to China. Mnuchin also forecast a doubling in sales of U.S. energy products to the Chinese market, increasing energy exports by $50 billion to $60 billion in the next three years to five years.Trade analysts were not surprised that China refused to agree to a numerical target for cutting the trade gap, but they said the talks probably were more successful in easing trade tensions.'The Trump administration seems eager to engineer at minimum a temporary peace with China to ensure a smooth run-up to the Kim-Trump summit in June,' Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad said, referring to the June 12 meeting scheduled between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.If there is success in the U.S.-China discussions, analysts suggest it likely would involve the countries' presidents this fall before the November elections.'Part of the good news for markets: As long as both sides continue to be 'constructively' engaged, imposition of additional tariffs by either side is very unlikely,' analysts at investment management firm Evercore ISI said in a research note. 'There is no reason for either side â€” particularly the U.S. â€” to destroy the process that both sides are building, which is what imposing tariffs would do.'Trump also pressed China to seal its border with North Korea 'until a deal is made' â€” an apparent reference to his upcoming summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.'China must continue to be strong & tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made,' he tweeted. 'The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in. I want this to happen, and North Korea to be VERY successful, but only after signing!'Last August, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer began investigating Beijing's strong-arm tactics to challenge U.S. technological dominance. These include outright cybertheft of U.S. companies' trade secrets and China's demands that American corporations hand over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese markets.Last month, the administration proposed tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports to protest the forced technology transfers. Trump later ordered Lighthizer to seek up to an additional $100 billion in Chinese products to tax.China responded by targeting $50 billion in U.S. products, including soybeans â€” a shot at Trump supporters in America's heartland. The prospect of an escalating trade war has shaken financial markets and alarmed business leaders.In a separate controversy, the Commerce Department last month blocked China's ZTE Corp. from importing American components for seven years, accusing the telecommunications company of misleading U.S. regulators after it settled charges last year of violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea.The ban amounted to a death sentence for ZTE, which relies heavily on U.S. parts, and the company announced that it was halting operations. A week ago, Trump tweeted that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to put ZTE 'back in business, fast.' Media reports suggested that the U.S. was offering to swap a ZTE rescue for an end to proposed Chinese tariffs on U.S. farm products.White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said there could be 'some small changes around the edges' in the sanctions against ZTE. But Kudlow added: 'Do not expect ZTE to get off scot-free. It ain't gonna happen.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US President Donald Trump holds a signed memorandum on intellectual property tariffs on high-tech goods from China, at the White House in Washington on March 22, 2018.WASHINGTON: China is 'strongly disappointed' in US President Donald Trump's decision to launch trade sanctions against Beijing but will not recoil from a trade war with the United States, the Chinese embassy in Washington said on Thursday.'If a trade war were initiated by the US, China would fight to the end to defend its own legitimate interests with all necessary measures,' the embassy said in a statement.Trump announced a consultation period for up to $60 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods and directed the US Treasury Department to develop US investment restrictions on China.Below is the statement issued by the embassy:'The United States persisted in conducting the '301 investigation' and announced relevant trade measures, ignoring rational voices, and in disregard of the mutually-beneficial nature of China-US trade relations and the consensus reached by the two countries of managing differences constructively through consultations.It is a typical unilateral trade protectionist action. China is strongly disappointed and firmly opposes such an action.Bearing in mind the principles of mutual respect and win-win co-operation, China has demonstrated sincerity in making reasonable suggestions to the US, and has made great efforts to address the current trade imbalance between China and the USChina does not want a trade war with anyone. But China is not afraid of and will not recoil from a trade war. China is confident and capable of facing any challenge.If a trade war were initiated by the US, China would fight to the end to defend its own legitimate interests with all necessary measures.The actions undertaken by the US are self-defeating. They will directly harm the interests of US consumers, companies, and financial markets. They also jeopardize international trade order and world economic stability.We urge the US to cease and desist, make cautious decisions, and avoid placing China-US trade relations in danger with the purpose of hurting others that eventually end up hurting itself.

"Immediately after the United States unveiled a 25% tariff on $16 billion worth of Chinese goods starting August 23, China retaliated, announcing a 25% tariff on $16 billion worth of US products that will go into effect the same day.The Trump administrationâ€™s tariffs announced on Wednesday were the second tranche of its $50-billion levies under Section 301 announced on June 15. In July, when the US implemented the first tranche, placing 25% tariffs on $34-billion of Chinese products, Beijing retaliated by imposing duties on an equal amount of American goods.The daily Report Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inboxIts latest tit-for-tat retaliation shows the Asian giant is determined to go toe-to-toe in its trade fight with the US.Beijingâ€™s resolve has also been on full display in recent days when it allowed or encouraged its state-run media outlets to adopt an aggressive posture vis-Ã -vis the US and its president. For instance, the Peopleâ€™s Daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, stringently accused Trump of starring in his own â€œstreetfighter-style deceitful drama of extortion and intimidationâ€? and vowed that the Peopleâ€™s Republic â€œwill not surrender to US threatening tactic[s]â€? and its â€œtrade blackmail.â€?Chinese state-run newspapers were particularly infuriated by the remarks of US National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow. In media interviews, Trumpâ€™s chief economic adviser warned that Beijing should â€œtake Trump seriously,â€? called Chinaâ€™s threat of imposing $60-billion-tariffs â€œa weak responseâ€? to Trumpâ€™s $200-billion proposal and believes that Chinaâ€™s economy is beginning to decline.In some ways, the Chinese governmentâ€™s resolution is quite surprising. The US is apparently gaining the upper hand over China in the current trade war between the worldâ€™s two superpowers. That its economy is doing well while Chinaâ€™s economy is slowing and its stock market has been faring better than the latterâ€™s since the trade dispute started is clear evidence that it has significant economic advantages over China.Itâ€™s also true that it is technically impossible for Beijing to match the USâ€™s tariff threat if the trade war escalates. The $110-billion tariffs on American exports already imposed or announced are nearing its tariff retaliation limit. According to the US Census Bureau, China bought only about $130 billion of US goods while selling $505 billion to the US in 2017.Moreover, as already noted, most of Trumpâ€™s key grievances against Beijing, such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer, are justified. In fact, they are shared not just by Americans across the political spectrum but by many in other countries, including Chinaâ€™s large trading partners, such as the European Union and its member states.In many other respects, Beijingâ€™s hardline response is, however, understandable. Indeed, there are a wide range of reasons behind Beijingâ€™s confidence that China can fight and, eventually, win the trade battle with Trumpâ€™s America and some of these have been recently singled out by the highly censored PRCâ€™s main newspapers, notably the Peopleâ€™s Daily and its influential offspring, the Global Times.These include Beijingâ€™s views that (1) the US is not up against â€œan economy like Japan, South Korea or Mexicoâ€? but â€œa major power,â€?which with a â€œ1.4 billion population continues to provide enormous market potentialâ€? that (2) â€œthe US is eager to solve it at one stroke, while China is prepared for a prolonged battleâ€? and that (3) â€œthe trade war started when the US first began harming others which in turn hurt itself and has lost support domestically and internationally.â€?These three claims are, by and large, true. The worldâ€™s most populous nation and second-biggest economy is â€œa major country.â€? Therefore, it is certainly difficult for the US to â€œstrike down a giant like China.â€? especially given the fact that â€œthe Chinese market is key to the survival of many big American companies and American farmers.â€?Beijing is also very astute to be â€œpatient to play with the Trump administrationâ€? and â€œprepared for a prolonged battle.â€?As an authoritarian, one-party regime â€“ which has ruled the PRC since its founding in 1949 and fully controls virtually every institution, everybody and every movement, including its state media and its populationâ€™s activities online â€“ the Chinese government can curb or limit any backlash caused by the trade war.By contrast, the Trump White House, like previous US administrations other democratic countries, doesnâ€™t have such a luxury. The longer the tariff battle lasts, the greater the harm it causes to the American people and US businesses and, consequently, the stronger their opposition is.The Peopleâ€™s Daily opined: â€œThough the US appears to be big and strong, it is, in fact. vulnerable from inside. Washington is too paranoid and stubborn to take care of the interests of American farmers, entrepreneurs and consumers.â€? Such a view is perhaps more applicable to China and its government than to the US and the Trump White House. If its slowing economy, as well as other recent signs and developments, are any guide, China seems to be big and strong but may be weak on the inside.The Trump administration isnâ€™t as indifferent to Americansâ€™ concerns as Beijing thinks. Its $12-billion assistance to farmers hit by tariffs is an indication. By contrast, the Chinese government has not yet taken any similar measures to help those affected by the USâ€™s tariffs. A major reason for this could be that in an authoritarian and highly censored China, people and companies arenâ€™t allowed to publicly voice their apprehension and opposition.The problem for the US and, indeed, for the Trump administration is that they cannot aid every company and every sector that is affected by the trade war, especially if the conflict is protracted. Chinaâ€™s leaders are well aware of this and, consequently, willing to play a prolonged gameThe problem for the US and, indeed, for the Trump administration is that they cannot aid every company and every sector that is affected by the trade war, especially if the conflict is protracted. Chinaâ€™s leaders are well aware of this and, consequently, willing to play a prolonged game.Another key factor, if not the main reason, behind Chinaâ€™s confidence that it can sustain and eventually win a prolonged trade battle with the US is that the Trump administration â€œhas lost support internationallyâ€? because it has waged trade wars against not just China but many other countries, including Washingtonâ€™s oldest and closest allies.Such an America-against-all approach hugely undermines his countryâ€™s economic, political and strategic position while greatly strengthening Chinaâ€™s.Undoubtedly, China is now an economic powerhouse, with a colossal market. Yet, if Trump maintained strong ties with the USâ€™s main trading partners and key allies it would have not only limited damages caused by Chinaâ€™s tariffs but also put greater pressure on Beijing.Trumpâ€™s recent truce with the 28-member European Union has somehow enhanced his leverage because it is not only the worldâ€™s biggest trading bloc but it also supports the USâ€™s accusations concerning Chinaâ€™s unfair practices. Whatâ€™s more, partly because of that, Beijing has apparently failed to convince Brussels to join forces against Trump.In one of his recent interviews, Larry Kudlow also revealed that, in an effort to isolate China, the Trump White House is â€œmoving close on Mexico,â€? the USâ€™s southern neighbor and one of its biggest trading partners.However, while they are essential, Trumpâ€™s recent overtures are insufficient. If he truly believes that China has consistently engaged in unfair trade practices and he is willingly and effectively confronting them as he repeatedly states, he definitely needs a bigger and stronger alliance.Trumpâ€™s unilateral decision to quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a huge 12-member trade deal, has greatly harmed America â€“ not only economically but also politically and strategically. Many nations of this accord, championed and signed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, are the USâ€™s key allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region and they share its concerns about China.His withdrawal reinforces a general view and Beijingâ€™s argument that Trumpâ€™s America is nationalist, protectionist, unilateralist and untrustworthy. As a result, Trump has lost not only economic and political leverage but moral ground, enormously limiting his ability to deal with China.Indeed, as already argued, if Trump continues to reject US-led multilateral trade deals, such as the TPP, and goes it alone against Beijing, it will be very hard, if not impossible, for him to sustain, let alone win, the trade war with the Asian giant.If he wants to have any chance of winning such a formidable battle with an increasingly assertive, authoritarian and powerful China, the American leader must adjust his foreign policy by seeking to strengthen or maintain his countryâ€™s international alliances and partnerships. The quicker he makes such a shift, the better because he cannot afford a lengthy trade fight with such an opponent.The good news for Americaâ€™s 45th president is that many of Washingtonâ€™s traditional allies and major partners are open to â€“ indeed, eagerly waiting for â€“ his rethink.Undoubtedly, such an about-turn isnâ€™t easy for him because Trump ran and won the presidency on an â€œAmerica Firstâ€? platform and, clearly, bonding isnâ€™t his style. But, then again, if he stubbornly continues his â€œAmerica Firstâ€? doctrine, he will transform his country into â€œAmerica Alone.â€? And, an â€œAmerican Aloneâ€? will never be taken seriously by a rising China.Asia Times is not responsible for the opinions, facts or any media content presented by contributors.

"The downturn in US-China relations and the continuing trade war between the two powers are the results of an American attempt at setting right the trade imbalance between the two. The alarming speed of Beijingâ€™s rise both on the economic and military fronts witnessed a steep increase in speculation among American leaders and scholars about Chinese intentions.Second, the questionable means adopted by China to make such rapid progress have aroused American suspicions over Beijingâ€™s geopolitical ambitions.The daily Report Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inboxAfter the turn of the 21st century, it was evident that American political and scholarly debate had begun to express such contentions. For instance, American scholar John Mearsheimer, by making a historical analysis of the United Statesâ€™ own behavior as a rising power in the past and then comparing it to Chinese behavior now, argued that Chinaâ€™s rise was bound to be hegemonic.He postulated in 2005 that if China maintained the pace of economic growth and military buildup that it was making at the time, it was likely to be locked into intense security competition with the US, with the possibility of military conflict.The US administration led by president George W Bush in an attempt to contain Chinese ambitions not only expressed its commitment to protect Taiwan from Beijingâ€™s territorial claims, it expanded arms sales to the island. The Bush administration reportedly shifted the focus of US missile defense plans from Europe to the Pacific and called for long-range weapons targeting Chinaâ€™s growing military power.American leaders and scholars alike continued to express concerns over Beijingâ€™s ever-growing expenditure on military modernization in the absence of palpable threats, lack of transparency in its military strategy, hegemonic policies in the South China Sea and maintenance of special relationships with â€œrogueâ€? regimes in Sudan, Iran and North Korea. Some scholars saw impeding danger in Chinaâ€™s increasing demand for energy resources (oil and natural gas) and export of Chinese goods with import regulation.The US for long was concerned with the Chinese failure to maintain international standards on intellectual-property rights within its territory, leading to a surge in cases of duplication, piracy and counterfeiting and losses for American companies. Beijing was allegedly involved in a process of industrial espionage to secure updated technology, which indicated that multinational companies had to reveal many operational and technological secrets as a precondition to gain access and operate in the biggest market of the world.Although China reportedly showed seriousness in implementing its commitment under the Protocol of Accession to the World Trade Organization, it adopted policies contradictory to free trade and principles of the organization after joining.Albert Keidel, who was serving at the US Department of the Treasury at the turn of the millennium, argued that Beijing accepted few obligations requiring it to give up or substantially reduce its stronghold on the key sectors of the economy. While Beijing made concerted measures to insulate its energy sector from global markets, the steel sector emerged as an international leader because of supportive measures adopted by the Chinese state. It was only under pressure from its major trading partners such as the US and the European Union that Beijing modified or removed some of the policies that were contradictory to its WTO obligations.Keidel further argued that China adopted discriminatory value-added tax (VAT) to discourage foreign competitors and encourage key indigenous industries.This apart, adoption of special policies to discourage the use of imported components for making telecommunication equipment and rejection of suggestions for unilateral liberalization since 2006 indicated Beijingâ€™s ambitions to take quick economic strides without taking international norms seriously, Keidel wrote in 2008.While the mammoth size of the Chinese market and its low-cost products attracted many major economies to engage in trade with and invest in the country helped its economy to grow rapidly, the US remained concerned as to the Chinese engagement with the world on its own terms.From a military and strategic perspective, the US not only viewed Chinese assertion of indisputable sovereignty over the South China Sea at the expense of the territorial claims of Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and others as violation of international laws, but it suspected Beijingâ€™s geopolitical moves as strategic maneuvers to gain control over strategic sea routes.A historical factor that has informed US scholarship contributing to deep-rooted mistrust and irreconcilability between American and Chinese geopolitical interests is Beijingâ€™s isolation from world politics during much of the Cold War era and its denial of membership in the United Nations until 1971. It is argued that as a former superpower (Middle Kingdom), this development might not have been glossed over by China, such that it was likely to adopt retributive policies once it rose to prominence again.The Barack Obama administrationâ€™s â€œpivot to Asiaâ€? strategy was clearly aimed at containing the Chinese influence in the Asia-Pacific region, and the subsequent Trump administration went a step further when it renamed the geographical area â€œIndo-Pacific region,â€? underlining the centrality of India in the US containment strategy.Under Obamaâ€™s leadership, New Delhi and Washington issued the Joint Strategic Vision for the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean Region in January 2015. The US declared India as a Major Defense Partner in December 2016. The two countries conducted joint military exercises and held a new bilateral Maritime Security Dialogue in April 2016 and signed the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) â€“ one of the foundational agreements for their strategic defense partnership. Defense trade between the two countries rose from US$1 billion in 2008 to more than $15 billion by the end of 2016.The Trump administration seems to be more concerned with the geopolitical implications of Chinaâ€™s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Leveraging on its accumulated economic power, China is forging ahead with the mega-project to move massive capital in the shape of loans to many countries for infrastructural and interconnectivity projects with the apparent objective of reviving the Silk Road and Maritime Silk Road cutting across the Asian, European and African continents.However, the Trump administration holds deep-rooted suspicions over Chinese geopolitical ambitions and has grilled Beijing on issues pertaining to rising indebtedness among countries involved in the BRI, lack of transparency, and disregard for an open and inclusive approach and sustainable financing.Chinese policy of offering quick loans without conditionality aroused American suspicions that the movement of capital was designed to encourage corrupt practices and was tied to political objectives such as gaining continued legitimacy for its Communist leadership and support for its one-China policy.US reservations remained as to the diversion of substantial portions of Beijingâ€™s investment toward building heavy infrastructure instead of building human-resource capacity under the BRI. Military and strategic objectives underlying the BRI were corroborated when Sri Lanka leased out its Hambantota Port to China for 99 years.As Pakistan is seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund to get over its economic crisis, the Trump administration is likely to exercise its influence to ensure that before any financial assistance is granted, the monies would not be diverted to repay Chinese loans.The Trump administration is evidently on the path of strengthening the US-Japan-India-Australia â€œQuadrilateralâ€? format in the Indo-Pacific region primarily as a way to contain Chinese influence. Meanwhile, Australia, the United States and Japan have announced a trilateral partnership to invest in projects, build infrastructure, address development challenges, increase connectivity, and promote economic growth.As well, after the high-level â€œ2+2 meetingâ€? between US and Indian officials in September, a joint statement also indicated that New Delhi shared US objectives in the Indo-Pacific region.Asia Times is not responsible for the opinions, facts or any media content presented by contributors.

President Trump fired the next salvo to kick off the hostilities by imposing 10% tariffs on up to $200 billion worth of Chinese imports effective September 24. Those tariffs rise to 25% on January 1, 2019.He exempted some technology products like Apple watches, Fitbits an iPhones, which implies he may want the new iPhone XS.China said they would take 'synchronised countermeasures' which will irritate the president.

If so, it means the U.S. has placed tariffs on all of Chinaâ€™s U.S. exports.China is annoyed at Americaâ€™s approach to negotiating a new trade deal and is coming to this war with weapons of its own. China has been keeping USD/CNY below 7.00. That could easily change. Devaluing its currency is one way of counteracting the U.S. measures. China could wreak havoc on the U.S. bonds if they decide to unload some of the $1.17 trillion in U.S. Treasurys that they own. China is reportedly looking into disrupting the U.S. supply chain by making it difficult for Americans to get technology and manufacturing parts. Sure, Chinaâ€™s economy would be damaged under such a scenario, but President XI Jinpingâ€™s term is far longer than President Trumps. And President Jinping doesnâ€™t have to deal with an unwieldy and uncooperative political opposition.Canadian dollar traders should be watching the U.S./China trade developments with trepidation. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is returning to Washington later this week for more trade talks. President Trump has not shown any evidence that he is willing to compromise on what he sees as unfair trade practices. Canadaâ€™s apparent insistence on maintaining its current dairy supply management program could be a deal-breaker for Trump. He has already said that if these talks fail, he will levy 25% sanctions on Canadian car imports.Another stumbling block to successful Canada/U.S. trade talks is the personality clash between U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chrystia Freeland. She has annoyed the Trump administration by her apparent support for anti-Trump causes.Canada is also disadvantaged in the trade talks by the trade disparity. The U.S. accounts for about 75% of Canadian exports, while U.S. exports to Canada are a mere 20%. The Americans are better situated to withstand the disruptions from a trade war with Canada.Canadian dollar traders are well aware of the dangers of the U.S./Canada trade talks collapsing which is why USD/CAD struggles to gain traction below $1.3000, despite expectations for another Bank of Canada rate hike next month.Canada Manufacturing Shipments data for July are expected to be 0.6%, down from 1.1% in June.Rahim Madhavji is the President of KnightsbridgeFX.com, a Canadian currency exchange that provides better rates than the banks to Canadians",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Washington, China has proposed a 25 percent tariff on US soybeans in response to a list of 1300 Chinese products that may be subject to a 25 percent tariff. China purchases 61 percent of total U.S. soybean exports, and more than 30 percent of overall U.S. soybean production.In other news, the US Environmental Protection Agency granted a â€œsmall refinerâ€? waiver from compliance with the US Renewable Fuel Standard to refineries operated by one of the nationâ€™s largest refining companies, Andeavor.Action on SoybeansThe background: The U.S. Trade Representative here determined that the acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce. USTR now is seeking public comment and will hold a public hearing regarding a proposed determination on appropriate action in response to these acts, policies, and practices.US Soybean association response: â€œIt should surprise no one that China immediately retaliated against our most important exports, including soybeans.â€?, said ASA President and Iowa farmer John Heisdorffer. â€œWe have been warning the administration and members of Congress that this would happen since the prospect for tariffs was raised. That unfortunately doesnâ€™t lend any comfort to the hundreds of thousands of soybean farmers who will be affected by these tariffs. A 25 percent tariff on U.S. soybeans into China will have a devastating effect on every soybean farmer in America. Soybean futures are already down nearly 40 cents a bushel as of this morning. At a projected 2018 crop of 4.3 billion bushels, soybean farmers lost $1.72 billion in value for our crop this morning alone. Thatâ€™s real money lost for farmers, and it is entirely preventable.â€?Action on the RFSYesterday, we reported that the Environmental Protection Agency has â€œso farâ€? granted hardship waivers for 25 smaller refiners, letting them out of the requirement to blend biofuels or purchase sufficient RINs to make up the difference. Applications continue to be received by the agency who says the conditions for receiving the waiver have not changed with the new administration despite 12 to 15 application being the norm for an average year when only half would be granted.Response from Sen. Chuck Grassley: â€œIf the reporting is accurate, it appears EPA granted a secret waiver that is legally reserved for small refiners to one of the largest oil refining companies in the country. If refineries are being allowed to retroactively get out of the renewable volume obligations the EPA assigned them in November, that fundamentally undermines the Renewable Fuel Standard. It would also amount to a massive government handout to a big corporation that made billions in profits just last year. Giving big corporations like Andeavor a free pass when other companies are required to follow the law of the land isnâ€™t just unfair, it may be illegal.â€?Growth Energy: Growth Energy sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt condemning the waiver decision and demanding a moratorium on waivers being issued by EPA. â€œWe ask that EPA immediately cease issuing waivers,â€? said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor, â€œand pause any waiver applications being considered until the agency conducts a full, transparent public comment process to help assure all stakeholders that the new expansion of small refinery waivers are consistent with the goals of the RFS. EPA appears to be operating under the cover of night in a secretive process where the agency acts as judge, jury, and executioner to effectively reduce the overall demand for biofuels in this country absent any public discourse.â€?Renewable Fuels Association: RFA CEO Bob Dinneen termed the move â€œan outrageous abuse of the statute.â€?The American Coalition for Ethanol: ACE CEO Brian Jennings added, â€œThe law allows a small refiner (producing less than 75,000 barrels per day) to seek an exemption from the annual blending obligation if it can prove the RFS is causing â€˜disproportionate economic hardshipâ€™ on its operations. On what planet does Andeavorâ€™s 2017 net profit of $1.5 billion constitute â€˜disproportionate economic hardshipâ€™ for a â€œsmall refinerâ€?? Refiners are reporting billion-dollar profits today while farmers are facing their fifth year of prices at or below the cost of production.â€?EPA backs off on higher efficiency for light-duty vehiclesIn Washington, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt determined that the current standards (the Final Determination of the Mid-term Evaluation of greenhouse gas emission standards for model year 2022-2025 light-duty vehicles) â€œare based on outdated information, and that more recent information suggests that the current standards may be too stringent.â€? The Administrator is withdrawing the previous Final Determination issued by the agency on January 12, 2017.EPA originally released the Phase 2 (12017-2025) standards in 2012, calling for average industry fleetwide level of 163 grams/mile of carbon dioxide (CO2) in model year 2025, which is equivalent to 54.5 miles per gallon.Bad news? Maybe not, says Clean Fuels Development Coalition CEO Doug Durante.Writing in the Digest, Durante said, â€œThe recent announcement that the Trump Administration was taking another look at Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards was a welcome reality check for what is a complex and multi-layered issue. There was an immediate knee jerk reaction that this will send us back to the days of muscle cars and wanton pollution when in truth it may be one of the most positive environmental actions anyone in the ethanol space could have hoped for.â€œWe have argued to anyone who would listen that vehicles and fuels must be looked at as an integrated system and questioned why EPA would not use all the tools at their disposal, including fuels, and more to the point, high octane fuels. The auto industry, the Department of Energy, and countless others have made it abundantly clear that significant gains in efficiency are there to be had with higher octane fuels in conventional engines.â€?Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor added, â€œFor several years, Growth Energy has strongly emphasized the fact that fuels and engines are a system and that high-octane fuels â€“ such as ethanol blends like E25-E30 â€“ should be part of this discussion,â€?â€œWe have provided a wealth of data to show that midlevel ethanol blends can be used by automakers to produce smaller, more efficient engines that will help meet future vehicle standards. We will continue to remain engaged with automakers and government stakeholders to ensure that biofuels are part of any long-term plan for engine efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction.â€?The Bottom LineStrange days in Washington. Lots of talk about RFS support at the top, but actions at the agency and department level are generally anti-RFS. The emissions order is promising for E30 ethanol, but it remains to be seen if this is an opportunity to consider better paths to high efficiency vehicles, or whether this is more of, as Doug Durante suggest it is not, a return to â€œdays of muscle cars and wanton pollutionâ€?. Stay tuned. One thing we can all agree upon is that the Trump Administration is never boring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs worth hundreds of billions of dollars on Chinese imports to the US as a trade war between the worldâ€™s two largest economies began on Friday.US tariffs on $34bn (Â£25.7bn) of Chinese goods have come into effect.China retaliated by imposing a similar 25 per cent tariff on 545 US products, also worth a total of $34bn.Mr Trump said the US might target Chinese goods worth $500bn â€“ the total value of Chinese imports in 2017.Beijing accused the US of starting the â€œlargest trade war in economic historyâ€? and has lodged a case with the World Trade Organization (WTO).â€œTrade war is never a solution,â€? said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. â€œChina would never start a trade war but if any party resorts to an increase of tariffs then China will take measures in response to protect development interests.â€?The government-run English language China Daily newspaper said: â€œThe Trump administration is behaving like a gang of hoodlums with its shakedown of other countries, particularly China.â€?Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch forecast only a modest escalation in the US-China battle, adding: â€œHowever, we canâ€™t rule out a full-blown, recession-inducing â€˜trade warâ€™.â€?Rob Carnell, chief Asia economist at ING, said: â€œThis is not economic Armageddon. We will not have to hunt our food with pointy sticks.â€œBut it is applying the brakes to a global economy that has less durable momentum than appears to be the case.â€?Chinaâ€™s decision to impose its own tariffs means US goods including cars, soya beans and lobsters are now subject to additional taxes.BMW said it could not absorb all of the 25 per cent tariff on the cars it exports to China from a plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina and would have to raise prices.The US tariffs are the result of Mr Trumpâ€™s attempt to protect US jobs and stop â€œunfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to Chinaâ€?.The White House said it would consult on tariffs on another $16bn of products, which Mr Trump has suggested could come into effect later this month.Mr Trump said: â€œYou have another 16 [billion dollars] in two weeks, and then, as you know, we have $200bn in abeyance and then after the $200bn, we have $300bn in abeyance. OK? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300.â€?Mr Trump has already imposed tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels, and started charging levies on the imports of steel and aluminium from the European Union, Mexico and Canada.The US tariffs imposed so far would affect the equivalent of 0.6 per cent of global trade and account for 0.1 per cent of global GDP, according to Morgan Stanley.Analysts are also concerned about the impact on others in the supply chain and about an escalation of tensions between the US and China in general.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BERLIN â€” A few weeks ago, it felt as if a trade war pitting the United States against allies like Australia, Canada, and the European Union was over before it even began. The Trump administration dispensed so many temporary exemptions to steel and aluminum tariffs that many countries figured the threats were just political theater.But with only days left before the exemptions expire and punitive tariffs take effect, itâ€™s dawning on foreign leaders that decades of warm relations with the United States carry little weight with a president dismissive of diplomatic norms and hostile toward the ground rules of international trade.What began as a way to protect American steel and aluminum jobs has since become a cudgel that the Trump administration is using to extract concessions in other areas, including car exports to Europe or negotiations to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada.AdvertisementAs a May 1 deadline looms, the decision on whether to grant permanent exemptions to the steel and aluminum tariffs, and to whom, appears likely to come down to the whims of President Trump, who has been influenced by brief interactions with foreign leaders and has seesawed between scrapping and rejoining global trade deals.Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the dayâ€™s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters hereThe European Union, the United Statesâ€™s biggest trading partner, indicated over the weekend that it was losing hope of reaching an agreement in the face of what many of the regionâ€™s political leaders regard as unreasonable demands. While a last-minute extension of the deadline is possible, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who met last week with Trump in Washington, said Sunday that Europe was ready to retaliate if Trump did not grant an exemption.The German government said in a statement that Merkel, President Emmanuel Macron of France, and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain agreed after speaking on the phone that if the tariffs go into force, â€œThe European Union should be ready to decisively defend its interests within the framework of multilateral trade rules.â€?The uncertainty is sowing chaos in international supply networks. Car companies and other manufacturers do not know whether ships carrying steel may suddenly be barred from US ports.Some countries are confident they will avoid the tariffs. Australia is treating an exemption as if itâ€™s a done deal. Brazil, which primarily exports slab steel to US manufacturers, is hoping to escape by agreeing on limited quotas for more sophisticated products. Argentina is counting on the good relationship between its president, Mauricio Macri, and Trump.Advertisementâ€œIn the conversations that we have on the issue, the positive relationships between our governments â€” and our presidentsâ€” certainly comes up,â€? Miguel Braun, Argentinaâ€™s trade secretary, said in an interview.But itâ€™s unclear whether the confidence is justified. The White House has not confirmed that Australia, Brazil, or Argentina will receive exemptions.In terms of the potential disruption to the global economy, the dispute with Europe may be the most critical. The United States and European Union account for about one-third of world trade.Only a few years ago the United States and Europe were discussing the possibility of eliminating almost all trans-Atlantic trade barriers. Now they are stymied by fundamentally different worldviews. As the Europeans see it, Trump is demanding concessions that would make them accomplices in dismantling a postwar trade framework they hold sacred.The Europeans want to play by the rules of the World Trade Organization; the Americans are making demands that would force the Europeans to break them.Advertisementâ€œIf we stick to the rules,â€? said Thiess Petersen, an analyst at the Bertelsmann Foundation in Germany, â€œthere is no chance for concessions.â€?German cars, are one of the major sticking points.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has been handling talks with the European Union, has been pushing the 28-nation bloc to reduce its tariffs on imported American cars as one way of cutting its trade surplus with the United States. In a recent interview with CNBC, Larry Kudlow, the chief economic adviser, said the United States wanted more concessions before it granted a permanent exclusion.But if the European Union accepted the demand for lower car tariffs, international treaties would require it to apply similar terms to automobiles from all other WTO members.The biggest beneficiary might be China. A member of the WTO, China is keen to become an auto exporter and would be thrilled to get easier access to Europe without giving up anything in return.Together, the countries seeking to extend temporary exemptions account for about half of American steel imports. The United States has already granted South Korea a permanent exemption as part of negotiations over a revised trade deal.Other countries have already been denied exemptions and started paying tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. They include China and Russia as well as Japan, a close ally.American negotiators appear to be trying to persuade countries to restrain their own metal shipments voluntarily â€” without retaliating against the United States or suing the country in international courts. But few countries appear eager to play along.For Canada and Mexico, among the largest exporters of steel and aluminum to the United States, the Trump administration has tied their exemptions to NAFTA talks. Negotiators from the three countries are scheduled to meet again on May 7 as they push to work through the major remaining disagreements and announce a revised pact.Canadian and Mexican negotiators played down the risk of the tariffs on Friday, suggesting that applying trade penalties in the meantime could sink the talks. Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign minister, said that the steel and aluminum tariffs were a â€œcompletely separate issueâ€? from the trade deal and that there was â€œno justification whatsoeverâ€? for trade barriers against Canada.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"caption Shipping containers are seen piled up at a port in Qingdao, Shandong province December 10, 2013. source REUTERS/China DailyLONDON â€“ A trade war between China and the US could impact smaller, global countries more severely than either of the two countries at the heart of the trade dispute.Friday is the deadline for the US to impose sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods and China has promised to retaliate with tariffs of its own if the US does follow through with its threat. Chinaâ€™s commerce ministry said on Thursday that the United States is â€œopening fire on the entire worldâ€?, warning that Washingtonâ€™s proposed tariffs on Chinese goods will hit international supply chains.A new model by economists at Pictet Asset Management has produced a list of countries that would be most economically damaged by an escalation in the trade war, Reuters reported.Countries are ranked by how integrated they are into the global value chain. The countries most at risk are those which supply raw materials to other countries, which then use those raw materials in the production of goods for export. Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, and Ireland are all vulnerable, according to Pictet.Here are the top 10 countries most at risk in the event of an all-out global trade war.

"China and the US have levied countervailing tariffs against billions of dollars worth of export products.Stuck in the middle of this trade dispute is Boeing, Americaâ€™s largest exporter.China accounts for 20% of Boeingâ€™s order book.This could result in lost future business and even canceled orders for Boeing.Thereâ€™s a US-China trade war brewing and Boeing is stuck in the middle of it.One day after the Trump administration proposed tariffs on more than 1,300 products exported to the US from China â€“ including aviation-related items â€“ the Chinese government announced retaliatory tariffs on more than 100 products from the US.This includes a 25% tariff on aircraft weighing between 33,000 pounds and 99,000 pounds. In other words, itâ€™s a 25% tax on Boeingâ€™s best selling plane, the 737.â€œGoing after China for aerospace is like living in a crystal palace throwing pebbles and expecting the other guy to not throw rocks,â€? Richard Aboulafia, Teal Group aviation industry analyst, told Business Insider.China is arguably Boeingâ€™s most important market. According to Morningstar, the Middle Kingdom accounted 25% of Boeingâ€™s 2017 deliveries and a whopping 20% of its 5,800-plane order book.caption China took delivery of its 1000th Boeing aircraft in 2013. source BoeingOver the next 20 years, Boeing expects Chinese demand for airliners to top 7,200 aircraft with a value of $1.1 trillion.In a statement, the airplane maker expressed its concern that the tariffs proposed by both nations would harm not only Boeing but also the global aerospace industry.â€œWe will continue in our own efforts to proactively engage both governments and build on the recent assurances by US and Chinese leaders that productive talks are ongoing,â€? the company said. â€œA strong and vibrant aerospace industry is important to the economic prosperity and national security of both countries.â€?China could cancel its Boeing ordersIn many regards, orders for Boeing aircraft are as much about flying passengers around the world as they are about political posturing.After all, there are few symbols of American industrial might more evocative than a shiny new airliner.Visits to the US by heads of state often include an order for Boeing airplanes.caption A China Southern Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. source Flickr/byeangelAs a result, â€œBoeing faces a massive risk of being used as a political pawn by the Chinese,â€? Vinay Bhaskara, a senior business analyst for the trade publication Airways, told us.For Boeing, the nuclear option in the short run would be for China to cancel its existing orders, which includes a monster 300 aircraft deal announced last November worth an eye-watering $38 billion.This, along with the countless other orders placed by Chinese customers represent one-fifth of Boeing business. The loss of these orders could prove to be devastating not only for Boeing but the ancillary businesses such as parts manufacturers that support the production of aircraft.According to Bhaskara, China is counting on its prominence in the market as leverage in Washington D.C.However, both Aboulafia and Bhaskara said it is highly unlikely that China would go this route for several reasons. For starters, no other OEM has the capacity to pick up the slack.Airbus currently boasts a 7,000 plane backlog that would take it the better part of a decade to work through. So thereâ€™s no way for it to simply absorb all of Chinaâ€™s demand for new aircraft.This dearth of production capacity would become a de facto cap on the growth of Chinaâ€™s aviation industry, Bhaskara said.Bhaskara said this is something the Trump administration is banking on as a counter to Chinaâ€™s market power.Another factor in Boeingâ€™s favor is Chinaâ€™s woefully underdeveloped domestic aviation industry. According to Aboulafia, Chinaâ€™s domestic commercial airplane program is decades behind the likes of Airbus and Boeing. As a result, COMAC, Chinaâ€™s state-owned jet maker, has to depend on technology transfers from Western manufacturers to make up for lost ground. This trade dispute would only slow that process down.But unlikely doesnâ€™t mean impossible.caption The Airbus A320-family jet at the companyâ€™s Tianjin, China assembly plant. source Damir Sangolj/ReutersIf China were to cancel its Boeing orders, it could turn to the second-hand market for planes. With leasing a popular option for even the worldâ€™s wealthiest airlines, there are always hundreds of second-hand planes available. As Airbus and Boeing deliver new A320neo and 737MAX aircraft to customers, there will be older planes coming out of service that will be ripe for Chinaâ€™s picking.And with the increasingly prominent role China is playing in the financing of airliners around the world, it would have first dibs of many these off-lease aircraft, Aboulafia pointed out.â€œWeâ€™re dealing with a different China here,â€? Aboulafia said. â€œItâ€™s a little more authoritarian than it was a couple of years ago. And a little more interventionist in the economy, so it could order its airlines to buy used planes instead.â€?So whatâ€™s the most likely outcome from all of this?Both analysts believe this trade dispute will likely result in the loss of orders for Boeing.â€œIâ€™d be surprised if we donâ€™t see a significant shift towards Airbus in orders this year,â€? Aboulafia told us.â€œA few months ago, Airbus signed an agreement with China to ramp up production rates at its Tianjin plant almost in anticipation of this,â€? he added.However, this shift shouldnâ€™t be permanent. After all, the worldâ€™s political landscape is forever shifting. The same goes for the world commercial aviation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"China has become a key market for US oil exports.The trade war between the US and China is heating up.China may retaliate with oil tariffs.Top energy executives are worried.As the U.S.-China trade spat turns into a full-blown war with tariffs and retaliatory tariffs and threats of further tariffs, U.S. energy exports to China may suffer if Beijing follows through with its threat to slap tariffs on U.S. oil and oil product imports.China has, in recent years, become a key export market for growing U.S. energy exports. In fact, China is Americaâ€™s second-largest crude oil customer after Canada and is also one of the biggest importers of U.S. propane and liquefied natural gas (LNG).Associations of U.S. manufacturers, retailers, and petroleum and chemicals producers have stepped up calls on the U.S. Administration to seek alternative solutions to the tariffs, warning that additional levies would hurt U.S. jobs and growth.If the United States were to impose tariffs on oil, U.S. oil sellers would have to look for other destinations and attract new customers, which could cost them more.Last year, more U.S. crude oil was sent to China than any other destination except Canada, the EIA said in an analysis on Tuesday. China received more U.S. crude oil in 2017 than the third- and fourth-largest importers combined, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.U.S. crude oil exports to China averaged 330,000 bpd between January and April this year, with February sales to China beating even exports to Canada, according to the EIA.And itâ€™s not just crude oil. China was also the third-largest destination for U.S. propane exports last year, behind only Japan and Mexico. Around half of U.S. propane exports went to Asia in 2017, displacing supplies from Middle Eastern countries and some regional production of propane.For LNG, 15 percent of U.S. exports went to China, making it the third-largest importer of U.S. LNG behind Mexico and South Korea.China, however, has explicitly excluded LNG from its list of U.S. energy goods that may be subject to tariffs, as it seeks to fight air pollution by a massive switch from coal-fired to gas-fired residential heating.Although China has ample supplies of coal, it imports some from the U.S. Last year, China received 3.2 million short tons of U.S. coal, which is equal to 3 percent of the total U.S. coal exports. This makes China the tenth-largest destination for U.S. coal exports.China has become a key trade partner for U.S. energy exports, and potential tariffs on U.S. energy goods could hurt U.S. producers and industries.Last week, China and the U.S. imposed another round of tariffs on each other, and the U.S. said on Tuesday that it could impose tariffs on an additional US$200 billion worth of Chinese imports.â€œAs a result of Chinaâ€™s retaliation and failure to change its practices, the President has ordered USTR to begin the process of imposing tariffs of 10 percent on an additional $200 billion of Chinese imports,â€? U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said.If China responds with tariffs on energy, this could cut sales of U.S. energy goods, analysts and executives told Reuters last month, when Beijing first threatened to slap tariffs on U.S. energy.â€œItâ€™ll force you to put your oil somewhere else, and itâ€™ll cost you moreâ€? to attract more buyers, said Ron Gasser, vice president at Texas-based Mammoth Exploration.In a statement on the latest U.S. list of potential new tariffs on China, David French, Senior Vice President for Government Relations at the National Retail Federation, said on Tuesday:â€œThe latest list of $200 billion of products to be subject to tariffs against China doubles down on a reckless strategy that will boomerang back to harm U.S. families and workers. The threat to the U.S. economy is less about a question of â€˜ifâ€™ and more about â€˜whenâ€™ and â€˜how bad.â€™ Tariffs on such a broad scope of products make it inconceivable that American consumers will dodge this tax increase as prices of everyday products will be forced to rise. And the retaliation that will follow will destroy thousands of U.S. jobs and hurt farmers, local businesses and entire communities.â€?Jack Gerard, Cal Dooley, and Edward R. Hambergerâ€”the president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, president and CEO of the American Chemistry Council, and president and CEO of the Association of American Railroads, respectivelyâ€”wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Examiner published on Wednesday that the trade war is threatening the U.S. economy and could add â€œhundreds of billions of dollars in potential costs for American businesses â€” costs that could ultimately be borne by consumers.â€?â€œPre-tariffs, the private sector was poised to invest $1.34 trillion in energy infrastructure to keep pace with surging production â€” supporting more than 1 million jobs each year on average through 2035. Tariffs could stifle hundreds of billions of dollarsâ€™ worth of projects â€” including new pipeline infrastructure needed to get oil and natural gas from the prolific Permian Basin to markets. The steel tariffs alone could increase the cost of a 280-mile pipeline by as much as $76 million,â€? Gerard, Dooley, and Hamberger said.â€œItâ€™s already clear that this well-intentioned policy will actually make the United States less competitive, undermine this administrationâ€™s vision of energy dominance and the manufacturing renaissance, and almost certainly destroy many more jobs than it protects.â€?Read the original article on OilPrice.com.

"caption Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and President Donald Trump source Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesLee Hsien Loong, the prime minister of Singapore, warned in an op-ed that a US-China trade war could endanger global security and the world economy.â€œUltimately, what is at stake is war and peace, and the security and stability of the world,â€? Lee said. â€œThe United States, China and the rest of the world have too much at stake.â€?The brewing trade war between the US and China could undermine not only the global trade order, but also the safety of the world, the prime minister of Singapore argued in an op-ed published Thursday.Lee Hsien Loong, the leader of Singapore since 2004, wrote in The Washington Post that President Donald Trumpâ€™s recent moves to crack down on imports from China could have major implications for the rules-based trading system created after World War II.Trump and China have gone back-and-forth over the past month with tariffs on goods. Following the announcements of increased trade barriers, economists expressed concerns that the decision could push the two nations into a damaging trade war.Lee also indirectly criticized Trumpâ€™s focus on bilateral trade balances. The US president has consistently cited trade deficits with China, particularly related to the trade of goods, as the measure of success or failure when it comes to trade policy. Lee argued that focus is misplaced, since a countryâ€™s trade deficits typically increase when the economy is strong.â€œFurthermore, the cause of a countryâ€™s trade deficit lies at home,â€? Lee wrote. â€œA trade deficit is the result of a country consuming more than it produces, and it is neither caused nor cured by trade restrictions.â€?Lee has a stake in the US and China avoiding a trade war: Singapore puts a heavy emphasis on trade to drive its economy. The small, sovereign city-state has used its strategic trading position to grow its economy into one of the richest in Asia, with a GDP per capita ranking second in the region behind only Macao, per the World Bank.â€œWe are a small, open economy with trade flows more than three times our GDP,â€? Lee said. â€œA trade war between the two largest economies in the world will have a big, negative impact on Singapore.â€?Singaporeâ€™s reliance on trade is also indicative of many of the other economies in the region. Lee cautioned that a trade warâ€™s economic consequences would not be limited to the two combatants.In addition to Leeâ€™s economic concerns, the prime minster warned that a trade war could undermine international security.â€œBeyond the economic loss, strained ties between the United States and China will make it harder for them to cooperate on other pressing issues such as the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, regional security, nonproliferation and climate change,â€? Lee wrote. â€œNone of these issues can be solved without the full participation of both countries.â€?Lee urged both countries to diffuse the tensions.â€œUltimately, what is at stake is war and peace, and the security and stability of the world,â€? he said. â€œThe United States, China and the rest of the world have too much at stake.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trumpâ€™s top economic advisers will be in China on Thursday to try and cool the recent trade tensions between the two countries.The talks will likely center on the US-China trade deficit and the trade of technology between the two countries.They could lead to a battle inside the US delegation between free traders and protectionists.A cadre of President Donald Trumpâ€™s top trade advisers touched down in China on Thursday in an attempt to deescalate recent trade tensions between the worldâ€™s two largest economies.The two countriesâ€™ recent back-and-forth on tariffs, and reports of more trade restrictions to come, have raised the specter of a trade war. While the US delegation is headed to Beijing in hopes of avoiding a negative economic outcome, the talks are likely to be contentious.The group is made up of key figures in the Trump administration, including:Treasury Secretary Steven MnuchinCommerce Secretary Wilbur RossNational Economic Council Director Larry KudlowUS Trade Representative Robert LighthizerWhite House National Trade Council Director Peter NavarroAt a US Chamber of Commerce event on Tuesday, Lighthizer downplayed expectations for the trip.â€œIâ€™m always hoping but not always hopeful,â€? Lighthizer said. â€œItâ€™s a big, big challenge.â€?What the two sides want out of the meetingThe US delegationâ€™s trip comes at a pivotal moment in US-China trade relations. Over the past two months, Trump has announced multiple rounds of tariffs that hit China square on the chin. And the Chinese government has responded in kind.Reports of possible additional actions targeting Chinese investment in the US and Chinese firms in certain sectors have pushed the two countries closer to a trade war that could be damaging for the global economy.According to the Wall Street Journalâ€™s Lingling Wei and Bob Davis, the US delegation plans to go in with a hard-ball strategy, simply asking what China is willing to concede given Trumpâ€™s threats of additional tariffs and trade actions. The delegation assumes China will recognize that it has more to lose in a trade fight.But the Chinese will likely not be easily intimidated. A Chinese official told Reuters Wednesday that the country is not afraid of a protracted battle with the US.â€œIn the event of a trade war, we have a much greater ability to endure the consequences than the US,â€? the official said.The two sides will also likely address two major long-term issues: technology transfers between the countries and the persistent trade deficit. Trump has long been obsessed with the US trade deficit with China, mentioning it in trade meetings and on Twitter.Much of the recent back and forth on trade has focused on technology transfers between the two countries. The US justification for the tariffs on Chinese goods was that Chinese firms were stealing American intellectual property. At the same time, China is trying to open the US market to more of its home-grown tech companies.Overall, the US delegations wants to open up the Chinese market to more US investment â€“ a tall task that will be met with resistance.Experts expect the meetings to produce little more than the promise of new dialogue between the two countries â€“ but that could be encouraging, given the recent tough talk.â€œThis trip will be important in creating the framework for future talks, though the central challenge remains in conceptualizing what the â€˜askâ€™ is from the Trump Administration that the Chinese could agree to,â€? said Chris Kreuger, a strategist at Cowen Washington Research Group. â€œAt best, these meetings will provide for the creation of the new Trump Economic Dialogue.â€?Trump praised his counterpart in China while previewing the trip on Twitter.â€œOur great financial team is in China trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade!â€? Trump said. â€œI look forward to being with President Xi in the not too distant future. We will always have a good (great) relationship!â€?Internal tug of warPerhaps the most interesting element of the China trip is not the discussion between the Chinese and the US officials, but the internal dynamics of the US delegation.It is split along ideological lines, and the fight between the two factions could be as indicative of the Trump administrationâ€™s policy going forward as anything that comes out of the meetings with the Chinese.On the one side is the protectionists, Navarro and Ross, who favor tighter trade controls and are willing to do battle with other countries to bring down the US trade deficit. On the other side are the free traders, Mnuchin and Kudlow, who want to mitigate the presidentâ€™s protectionists tendencies as much as possible.Krueger said the hodgepodge opinions of the main players in China will create a â€œStar Wars bar scene of Trumpâ€™s economic teamâ€? and most of the debate in Beijing could be internal.â€œLighthizer and Navarro share Trumpâ€™s visceral view on trade: the most important aspect is the goods trade deficit. This is not the view of Mnuchin and Kudlow,â€? the strategist said. â€œThis sets up a bizarre situation where the U.S. team may spend most of the talks negotiating among themselves.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"caption Donald Trump source Leah Millis/ReutersPresident Donald Trumpâ€™s tough recent talk on trade gave him some small victories, in the form of new negotiations with China and South Korea.His strategy may be an intentional ploy to extract gains in international trade.While itâ€™s showing some signs of working, experts say his posturing may eventually backfire.President Donald Trump fell into a familiar pattern during the month of March, announcing tough trade actions and eventually backing off the most damaging possibilities when allies raised concerns.The moves have seemed to produce to produce some results:South Korea agreed to renegotiate their main trade deal with the US.China came to the table to talk about opening up their market to US businesses.And Trump tweeted that other countries started trade talks with the administration.â€œThere may be a method to his madness,â€? Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments, told Business Insider.But economists and analysts say Trumpâ€™s constant posturing on trade isnâ€™t sustainable in the long-term.Trump developed a useful patternâ€¦Valliere said the rhythms of Trumpâ€™s trade style became familiar over the past month, and other nations are starting to notice.â€œItâ€™s possible that many countries have gamed out the Trump style â€“ all bluster and threats initially, leading to some modest trade concessions, giving Trump an opportunity to boast that he got results,â€? Valliere said.Some analysts say Trumpâ€™s posturing may actually reflect a larger scheme from the president that represents his signature style of negotiating.â€œOther administrations have gone to trading partners like China and asked for a fairer deal, only to get a cigar put out on their forehead,â€? Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors, told Reuters. â€œI suspect Trumpâ€™s bucking of norms is absolutely part of his negotiating tactics.â€?But others see a more complex situation. Gregory Daco, the chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said he suspects the rest of the administration may simply be trying to contain the fallout from Trumpâ€™s original comments.â€œI donâ€™t know if itâ€™s a strategy by design, I donâ€™t think that the decisions weâ€™ve seen over the past few weeks have been fully thought through,â€? Daco told Business Insider. â€œWhatâ€™s happened is more reaction to the presidentâ€™s more flamboyant announcements.â€?Daco said most of the negotiating and eventual softening was the work of other members of the administration trying to contain Trumpâ€™s impulses on trade.Intentional or not, so far Trump got some major concessions out of the tough talk but that doesnâ€™t mean the US will win so much that Americans get sick of trade wins.â€¦but it may not work for longcaption President Donald Trump welcomes Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago state in Palm Beach, Florida. source Reuters/Carlos BarriaDaco said Trumpâ€™s constant jabs at allies could eventually provoke a more serious response.â€œA big concern is that you end up in a situation where countries get a little bit tired of this quite aggressive approach from the US and decide to act a little bit more strongly as a reaction to the tariffs imposed by the US,â€? Daco said.Other nations had already lined up action against the US before backing down as the Trump administration negotiated exemptions.Trumpâ€™s strategy could also risks alienating allies that could be helpful in more expansive trade disputes. As Fred Bergsten, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argued in a recent analysis, tough action against actual trade rule violators, like China, requires action from more than just the US.â€œTo effectively attack Chinaâ€™s trade and investment policies, however, the United States must have allies,â€? Bergsten said. â€œWe no longer have the power to unilaterally compel other countries, especially a superpower like China, to mend their ways.â€?With the possibility of a backfire looming, Trump may be slowly recognizing that his strategy isnâ€™t necessarily sustainable in the long-term, Valliere said.â€œIâ€™m not ready to sound an all-clear but it appears that Trump listens to the markets, which quite clearly are telling him to cool it,â€? the strategist said, referring to days of stock-market plunges that have accompanied Trumpâ€™s announcements..If the president doesnâ€™t learn, Daco said, that might put the US in a tough spot.â€œThink about somebody playing with a knife on a playground,â€? Daco said. â€œThe other kids might decide to be careful initially but after a while there might actually be more severe consequences and actions for someone wielding a dangerous instrument.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"source Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesThere are some signs that President Donald Trumpâ€™s tariffs on steel, aluminum, and other imports are slowing hiring in manufacturing-heavy states, according to Deutsche Bank.Warnings that Trumpâ€™s trade policies could produce this kind of result have been pouring in from economists.Itâ€™s still early days, but there are some signs that the Trump administrationâ€™s approach to trade is hurting jobs in the most affected states.Since announcing tariffs on steel and aluminum in March, the US has rolled out import taxes on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, and threatened an additional $100 billion in tariffs. In response, China announced plans to impose tariffs on more than 100 American products worth $50 billion annually, including important exports like soybeans and autos.The chart below shows employment growth in states that have a higher-than-average volume of trade in steel, aluminum, airplanes, cars, and soybeans â€“ all products that are impacted by tariffs. In recent months, theyâ€™ve accounted for a smaller share of total job growth, according to Torsten SlÃ¸k, Deutsche Bankâ€™s chief international economist.â€œThe bottom line is that continued corporate uncertainty about input costs and output demand is likely to weigh on job growth going forward,â€? SlÃ¸k said.Warnings that Trumpâ€™s trade policies could have this kind of outcome have been pouring in from economists. The World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund are among the major institutions that have warned a trade war between China and the US would hurt the global economy.Also, the Federal Reserveâ€™s latest Beige Book of feedback from businesses across America released last week mentioned the word â€œtariffâ€? 36 times. There were no mentions in the March document.This is what a Fed contact in Boston said:â€œIn general, respondents were optimistic in their outlook. However, two contacts brought up the proposed China tariffs and said they represent a major risk. One was a toy manufacturer who sources 75 percent of their production from China. The second said that punitive tariffs on Chinese aluminum had already had a big effect: â€œThin gauge foilâ€? is produced only in China and tariffs raised the price three-fold; the contact argued that â€œthese tariffs are now killing high-paying American manufacturing jobs and businesses.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The US Department of Commerce claims that POSCO Vietnam processes materials from China into products and sell them to the US.The U.S. Department of Commerce has announced that it will slap tariffs of over 200% on products made by POSCO Vietnam, claiming that the POSCO subsidiary in Vietnam processes materials from China into products and sell them to the U.S. This marks the first time that an overseas corporation of a Korean company falls victim to the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China.POSCO recently filed a complaint against the U.S. Commerce Department's preliminary judgment to levy retaliatory tariffs on cold-rolled steel sheets produced by POSCO Vietnam. The complaint was a rebuttal of the U.S. governmentâ€™s announcement in December last year that they would punish POSCO Vietnam for making products with Chinese materials and exporting them to the U.S. POSCO has repeatedly asserted that products made with materials from China are sold to the Korean market, but the U.S. Department of Commerce has not accepted it.Washington claims that POSCO Vietnam processed Chinese materials into cold-rolled steel plates and exported them to the U.S., so POSCO Vietnamâ€™s export products should be regarded as Chinese cold-rolled steel plates. For this reason, U.S. authorities are saying that a 265.79% tariff on Chinese cold-rolled steel plates should be applied to those of POSCO Vietnam.While the final judgment is expected to come out this year, industry watchers believe POSCO will not be able to avoid high tariffs. They say the United States will impose tough sanctions to put pressure on China as the trade war between the two is intensifying.'Even though there are some cases where POSCO Vietnam makes products with Chinese materials and sell them in Vietnam, POSCO Vietnam has not exported them to the United States,' said a steel industry official. 'The U.S. uses Korea to put pressure on China.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Chinese view Mr Mnuchin as a potentially more moderate voice who would be more reluctant to start a trade conflict that could damage US businesses and cause stock markets to plunge.WashingtonWITH trade tensions mounting between the United States and China, President Donald Trump said he would dispatch Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other top economic advisers to Beijing next week to try to forestall an all-out trade war.On Tuesday, Mr Trump said he was optimistic that the United States could reach a deal with China. But he warned that if China did not live up to its promises to open its markets, his administration would proceed with the tariffs he has threatened to impose on as much as US$150 billion worth of Chinese products.'I think China is very serious, and we're very serious,' Mr Trump said between meetings with President Emmanuel Macron of France. 'We have no choice but to be very serious.' Mr Trump said that the US delegation was making the trip at China's request and that he was heartened by recent remarks by President Xi Jinping, suggesting that he was prepared to open his country's economy to more foreign investment and ease restrictions on imports of American cars.sentifi.com Market voices on:The two countries have been locked in a battle over tariffs, with the United States threatening to tax Chinese products such as TVs and medical devices and the Chinese retaliating with tariffs on pork and threatening to impose additional penalties on soyabeans and other American goods.Mr Mnuchin is expected to be joined on the trip by Larry Kudlow, director of the White House's National Economic Council, and Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative. The delegation comprises a wide range of views on trade, with Mr Mnuchin and Mr Kudlow, a former CNBC economic commentator, more receptive to free trade and resistant to draconian tariffs, and Mr Lighthizer encouraging the president to take a harder line. Peter Navarro, a trade adviser and the author of the book Death by China, may also travel with the group, but an administration official said the details were not yet completed.Chinese officials have turned to Mr Mnuchin as their primary contact in trade talks, which some observers say may stem from China's perception that he is more sensitive to their concerns. After the formal 'economic dialogue' between the United States and China stalled last summer, Mr Mnuchin has held regular discussions with his Chinese counterparts, including Liu He, China's new economic minister.The Chinese view Mr Mnuchin and Mr Kudlow, who both worked on Wall Street, as potentially more moderate voices who would be more reluctant to start a trade conflict that could damage US businesses and cause stock markets to plunge. They hope the two men will be more sympathetic to offers to open up China's financial market and reduce its trade surplus by making purchases of American natural gas and other products, people briefed on the deliberations said.Mr Navarro and Mr Lighthizer, meanwhile, have criticised China's offerings and insisted that the Chinese make more sweeping changes to its economy, including removing industrial subsidies and rolling back government intervention in the economy.The stakes of the trip are high after months of increasing strain between China and the United States. Fears about a trade war between the world's two biggest economic powers emerged in March after Mr Trump unveiled tariffs on global imports of aluminium and steel. The threat of tariffs on up to US$150 billion of Chinese imports followed.Next month, the Treasury Department is expected to release a plan to further restrict Chinese investment in US companies, including industries such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence that are sensitive for national security reasons. The rules could also restrict US partnerships with Chinese companies abroad.Some veterans of trade talks with China caution that Mr Trump's approach could backfire.'I think that it's very dangerous to get into a tit-for-tat war in trade, because even if your goal is to be moderate and proportional in response, one thing can lead to another and it can get out of control,' Jacob Lew, the Treasury secretary under former president Barack Obama, told CNBC last week.However, Paul H O'Neill, who was president George W Bush's first Treasury secretary and travelled to China for talks in 2001, said it was a good sign that the US delegation was making the trip. Negotiations with Chinese officials tend to be well choreographed, he said, so it is likely that the dimensions of a trade agreement are starting to take shape.'There's already been endless conversations, and tweets, from our side,' Mr O'Neill said in an interview. 'They are shadow dancing with each other, but behind the scenes where we can't see what is going on, apparently they are making some progress.'

"[WASHINGTON] As the US-China trade spat gets uglier, people in both countries are asking: Who has more to lose? And how does this end?China has more to lose economically in an all-out trade war. The Chinese economy is dependent on exports, and nearly 20 per cent of its exports go to the United States.It sold US$506 billion in stuff and services to the US last year. In contrast, the US only sold US$130 billion to the Chinese.'In a serious economic battle, the US wins. There is no question about it,' said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who has helped advise the administration on China.sentifi.com Market voices on:But this isn't just an economic fight, it's also political, and there's a strong case that President Donald Trump would be less able to sustain a protracted conflict than the Chinese - especially with the 2018 midterm elections coming soon.Chinese President Xi Jinping runs a communist country that has just granted him the ability to rule for life. He controls the media in his country and is also sitting on top of about US$3 trillion in surplus cash.All of this means Mr Xi can react quickly to Mr Trump. He can even aid Chinese companies that get hurt in the coming months and subsidise soybean prices so Chinese consumers don't face massive sticker shock at the store.The Chinese used similar tactics during the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, spending heavily from their surplus reserves to stimulate their economy and insulate their people from pain. The Chinese cash reserves are not as large now, but they still have more than the US does.Mr Trump doesn't have it so easy. He's already getting phone calls from Republican lawmakers who are angry at what he's doing with the tariffs. He faces backlash from Wall Street, from executives of companies such as Boeing and from soybean farmers in the Midwest, many of whom voted for Mr Trump and feel betrayed.Some GOP leaders fear Mr Trump's actions could cost the party seats in the 2018 midterm elections.'Within the next 12 months, China can withstand much more than the US can withstand,' said Evan Medeiros, managing director at the Eurasia Group and a former senior adviser to Obama on Asia.'The Chinese aren't constrained by the rule of law or a representative democracy.'While much of the focus so far has been on tariffs - Mr Trump has threatened to put tariffs on about US$50 billion worth of Chinese goods and China has responded with threats to do the same on US goods - China has more levers it can pull to punish the United States.The Chinese could stop cooperating on North Korea, they could sell some US debt to roil markets and they could make life harder for US companies operating in China, such as Nike, Disney or Apple. These Chinese actions are seen as unlikely, especially selling US Treasurys.For the Trump administration, corresponding moves aren't even on the table, as the US government doesn't have as much direct control over companies operating within its borders.Mr Trump is in a tricky situation. He is feeling confident after his administration renegotiated the South Korean free trade deal to give US automakers greater access to that market. But South Korea is the world's No 11 economy, and the country depends on the United States for military aid. China is the No 2 economy and it does not feel the same degree of pressure to give in to Mr Trump.Domestically, Chinese politicians face pressure to project their country as a world power, making rolling over for a bellicose US president a wildly unpopular proposal.'There is no way on earth China can be seen to be kowtowing to the US on this. Xi cannot say: All right, Trump threatened us, so we'd better give in,' said Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.The surprisingly swift and strong reaction from China this week seemed to be a message to Mr Trump that the Chinese think they can play a long game.At the moment, Mr Trump is threatening a relatively small amounts of tariffs. Those are unlikely to damage the overall economy or significantly raise prices (Mr Trump has been careful to avoid tariffs on Chinese shoes, clothes and trinkets that fill so many shopping aisles), but certain places in America are about to feel great pain if the Chinese follow through with their threats to retaliate. It's hard for farmers and winemakers to understand why they are casualties in a supposed fight against China stealing intellectual property and industrial know-how.The Brookings Institution looked at all the products China has threatened to put tariffs on. They would impact about 2.1 million jobs that are spread out over 2,783 US counties. Eighty-two per cent of those counties voted for Mr Trump in the last election.'Xi is probably doing a more rationale analysis of the situation than the Trump Administration seems to be doing,' said J Stapleton Roy, a former US ambassador to China under former presidents George HW Bush and Bill Clinton.'The Trump Administration doesn't seem to grasp the fact that they are damaging the wrong people (the farmers)' in this fight.China's strategy appears to be: Get farmers, business leaders and Republicans in Congress angry enough to pressure Mr Trump to back down. This strategy seemed to work for many countries with Mr Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs.When Mr Trump first announced the metal tariffs, they were supposed to apply to every country in the world. By the time they went into effect, 63 per cent of imports were exempt from the tariffs, according to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.A key problem for Mr Trump is that he doesn't have clear and coherent demands of China. He and his team talk about three problems: The trade deficit, Chinese intellectual property (IP) theft, and China's industrial policy (known as 'Made in China 2025').But there's not a specific request, and the lack of one is allowing the Chinese to play the victims in a scenario where the US is supposed to be trying to correct years of wrongs.'I want the US to do more against China, but I want the US to do more with a plan,' said Mr Scissors.'We need very specifics asks of the Chinese. Instead, we just say, 'we want you to change.''The president and his team sometimes say different things about trade and what the goals are. Mr Trump likes to use confusion as a negotiating tactic, but it also opens up more ways to 'win'.'What counts for success for Trump is going to be very different than what his advisers want. Trump can probably be bought off with some package of goods to reduce the trade deficit. His advisers want China to rewrite its entire industrial policy,' said Mr Medeiros.Mr Trump has famously said a trade war will be 'easy to win'.Mr Xi isn't saying that. Mr Xi has made it clear he doesn't want a trade war, but he will respond to anything Mr Trump does. Mr Xi seems to be setting himself up for an easier political win if anything goes sour on the economic front.But in politics, Mr Trump has proved himself a skillful salesman. Many strategists and longtime foreign policy experts say the most likely scenario is Mr Trump gets a few small concessions from China and declares victory.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said last week that China is prepared to ease market access for US companies and stop forcing foreign companies to transfer technology. If Mr Trump gets those kinds of concessions in writing, he would be able to say he did more for American against China than Obama, Bush or Clinton.But those changes would do little to alter the record US trade deficit with China or to deter China from plans to go head-to-head with the US in many high-tech sectors soon. If Mr Trump wants those major concessions, he has to be ready to go much harder against the Chinese.So far, Mr Xi appears to be betting that Mr Trump will cave to political pressure before that happens.WP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Alberta's minister of energy will have sweeping discretionary powers to limit exports of crude, natural gas and gasoline to B.C. under much-anticipated legislation introduced Monday.Bill 12, titled Preserving Canada's Economic Prosperity Act, gives the Alberta government the ability to retaliate against the B.C. government for any delays to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, by driving up gas prices or slapping restrictions on shipments of other energy products.'We are very committed to putting pressure on B.C. to come around and focus on what this pipeline actually means,' Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said.The majority of gasoline and aviation fuel used in B.C. is shipped from Alberta through the existing Trans Mountain pipeline.Limiting exports could create shortages in B.C., forcing it to look elsewhere for gasoline. Alberta could also divert crude oil shipments to rail and truck, in order to free up pipeline space for bitumen.All these measures could amount to driving up prices at the pump, which could create political problems for B.C. Premier John Horgan.Kinder Morgan has set May 31 as its deadline for deciding whether it will proceed with the Trans Mountain project. ?If investor certainty isn't there by then, Notley said, then the Alberta government may take action.'Then that might be the point at which we're going to have to be a lot more strategic around what products get shipped to what markets by what means,' she said.B.C. Attorney General David Eby said he is prepared to take Alberta to court over the legislation if it causes gas prices in his province to jump dramatically.$10M daily fineThe bill will give Alberta's Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd power to issue licences for the export of crude oil, natural gas and refined products like gasoline and aviation fuel.The licences can set limits on where product goes and on how much can be exported over a defined period of time. The minister can determine how product is exported, through pipeline, rail or truck.Corporations that violate terms of a licence face a fine of $10 million a day.The government claims it has received a legal opinion indicating the legislation would not violate the Constitution, NAFTA or any internal trade agreements.If passed, the bill would come into effect upon proclamation.Jason Kenney, leader of the Official Opposition United Conservative Party, has called on the government to turn off the taps to B.C., but he is reserving opinion on the bill until his caucus can read it more closely.'We certainly accept the goal but we have to do our due diligence as the opposition to make sure the bill doesn't go farther than it needs to,' he said.Kenney added the UCP may propose an amendment to put a sunset clause on the bill, so the minister doesn't retain these powers longer than necessary.The bill was introduced one day after Notley and Horgan met with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa to discuss the dispute between the two provinces over proceeding with the pipeline.Alberta's proposed law came up in the discussions, and according to Notley, her B.C. counterpart said he hoped that it would not go ahead.Notley said delays to the proposed pipeline project will cost Canada an estimated $40 million a day in lost revenue.The Alberta and federal governments are in talks with Kinder Morgan on ways to give the company financial assurances the Trans Mountain pipeline project will go ahead.The Texas-based company cited resistance from the B.C. government when it announced recently it was halting all non-essential spending on the project.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON â€” President Donald Trump praised tariffs in a tweet Tuesday morning, saying that â€œtariffs are the greatest!â€? and that countries that treat the United States unfairly on trade must either negotiate fair deals or get â€œhit with tariffs.â€?â€œItâ€™s as simple as that â€” and everybodyâ€™s talking!â€? Trump wrote. â€œRemember, we are the â€˜piggy bankâ€™ thatâ€™s being robbed. All will be great!â€?The tweet came the same day that American motorcycle icon Harley-Davidson reported stronger-than-expected earnings in its second quarter, offering a look at how the company could fare in the midst of an international trade war.Harley-Davidson, which plans to ship 231,000 to 236,000 motorcycles this year, said that it expects the tariffs to cut into its margins. It expects its operating margin as a percent of revenue to come in at 9 to 10 percent because of the impact of the tariffs, down slightly from last year. Earnings for the quarter came in at $1.45 per share, above some projections but down from the $1.48 reported at the same time last year.Harley-Davidson Chief Executive Matt Levatich said the companyâ€™s performance in the second quarter was in line with expectations.â€œOur manufacturing optimization, demand-driving investments and commitment to manage supply in line with demand remain on target and continue to strengthen our business,â€? Levatich said.Harley-Davidson earlier this year announced plans to move some of its production overseas to avoid any repercussions of a trade war. The company that prides itself in its made in the USA brand has plants in operation in Australia, Brazil and India. Last month, Trump threatened heavy taxes on Harley-Davidson and said that if the company moved overseas, â€œit will be the beginning of the end.â€?Harley-Davidson had long-established plans to open a new plant in Thailand.

"Bed Bath & Beyond's stock price sank by more than 20% today after it became the latest company to say tariffs on Chinese imports were hurting business.Chief Executive Steven Temares said on a conference call that his company is trying its best to blunt the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies by finding suppliers elsewhere, but such moves would take time.'It's a little bit of a black hole,' he said. 'We're working it very aggressively, and we'll have to see.'Bed Bath didn't quantify the toll taken by the tariffs. Last week the White House escalated its trade war with China by saying it would impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods on top of the $50 billion already instituted earlier this year. The news was the latest in a series of blows for the Union, N.J.â€“based retailer, which has struggled to adapt to the age of Amazon. Heading into today, its stock price had lost half its value since spring 2017 and now is at its lowest point since 2000.Bed Bath reported that same-store sales fell for the sixth consecutive quarter, and earnings fell short of Wall Street targets. The retailer also lowered its financial guidance for the year and said earnings probably wouldn't grow again until 2020.Hoboken-based Newell Rubbermaid, which makes Crock-Pots and Sharpie pens, warned in August that Chinese tariffs could cost it $100 million in revenue. Nationally Alcoa, Caterpillar, General Motors, Harley-Davidson and Whirlpool also have said that trade wars have affected business.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Downing Street insisted today Theresa May remains confident she can strike a US trade deal despite Donald Trump's threats of massive new steel tariffs.The US President has rocked hopes of a major post-Brexit deal by launching salvos of rhetoric against trade deals he says undermine American jobs.Mrs May spoke to Mr Trump last night to express grave concern at the threat to impose 25 per cent tariffs on steel imported to America.If imposed Europe would be forced to respond in kind, launching a transatlantic trade war just as Britain leaves the EU to embrace a global free trade future.President Donald Trump has doubled down on trade pressure, but Mrs May (pictured right in London today) urged him to think again about steel tariffsFollowing the renewed tensions, Mrs May's spokesman today said: 'I think both the prime minister and the president have been clear on the importance of reaching a bilateral, post-Brexit trade deal.'The USA is our biggest trade partner, we invest over Â£500bn in each other's economies and over 1million Americans work for UK companies, so you would expect us to remain close partners and continue to work at the highest levels to make the case for UK industry to the US government.'The tit-for-tat began last week when Mr Trump called for 25 per cent tariffs on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminium to protect domestic producers.The EU then hit back by suggesting it would hike duty on Harley-Davidson motorbikes, bourbon and American blue jeans.That in turn prompted Mr President to up the ante by threatening to pump up taxes on car imports from Europe.The row has raised fresh fears about a major international meltdown over trade, as Mr Trump follows through on his pledge to stop America being exploited by other countries.In a phone call with the US leader last night, Mrs May urged him to cool the row and back down on the steel tariffs.'The Prime Minister raised our deep concern at the President's forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all parties' interests,' a No10 spokeswoman said.But soon afterwards Mr Trump tweeted: 'We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals. Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the US for many years.'Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry, it's time for a change! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'On the BBC's Sunday Politics show yesterday, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington branded the threats 'inadvisable', saying: 'Trade wars don't do anybody any good.'The US president reiterated his determination to act overnight saying America had been 'taken advantage of' for 'many years' and it had to stopIn a series of tweets over the weekend, Mr Trump stoked the row by warning that the EU was taking the US 'for fools'.'If the EU wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on US companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the US,' he said.'They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!' he continued.Last year, the US ran a $151billion trade deficit with the EU, accounting for about one-fifth of America's $796billion global trade deficit.'The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our 'very stupid' trade deals and policies,' Mr Trump said.'Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!'In a series of tweets over the weekend, Mr Trump stoked the row by warning that the EU was taking the US 'for fools'The latest escalation in tensions came after the EU announced plans on Friday to target key imports from the US.It was responding to Mr Trump's threat of 25 per cent tariffs on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminium to protect domestic producers.The move could be potentially devastating for UK and EU exporters.Asked about the US move, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker told German TV: 'We will put tariffs on Harley-Davidson, on bourbon and on blue jeans - Levis.'We are here and they will get to know us.'A spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said US steel tariffs would hurt international commerce.'The German government will look very closely at this decision and then assess the impact on the German and European economies,' the spokesman said.'We will put tariffs on Harley-Davidson, on bourbon and on blue jeans - Levis,' said European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured)Figures from European steel association Eurofer show the US was the destination of about 15 percent of Europe's steel exports in 2017.Trade association UK Steel said the proposed measures would be an 'extremely blunt' reaction to a complex global problem.Unite union national officer for steel Tony Brady said if the tariffs applied to the UK, they would be 'devastating'.Cabinet Office minister David Lidington yesterday rebuked the US, saying a trade war was in nobody's interests.Mr Lidington suggested the American authorities could overrule any tariffs, as they did in the case of aircraft manufacturer Bombardier when Mr Trump's administration threatened huge duties on its C-wing planes.The minister said: 'We'll have to see what happens, I mean there was a lot of concerns recently about something comparable with regards aviation and the aircraft that were being produced in part by Bombardier in Belfast in Northern Ireland, and the American authorities at the end of the day struck that down, they said no that is not the way that we should be going.'And he warned Mr Trump that Britain's experience showed his plan would not work.'We tried in Britain in the 60s and 70s protecting our car industry from competition,' Mr Lidington said.'It actually didn't work, it protected inefficiencies, we lost all our export markets because our competitors who were more competitive went out and gobbled those up from us, and the car industry had to go through a very, very painful restructuring to get to the success story it is now.'A Downing Street spokesman said last week: 'We are engaging with the US on what this announcement means in practice.'We are particularly concerned by any measures which would impact the UK steel and aluminium industries.Downing Street said last week that Theresa May is 'concerned' by Mr Trump's threats about the steel industry'Over-capacity remains a significant global issue and we believe multi-lateral action is the only way to resolve it in all parties' interests.'The issue is particularly sensitive given the UK's hopes of striking a post-Brexit trade deal with Mr Trump's USA.China has made clear it is ready to hit back if economic sanctions are brought forward against its interests.'China doesn't want a trade war with the United States,' said a spokesman for the National People's Congress.'But if the US takes actions that hurt Chinese interests, China will not sit idly by and will take necessary measures.'Canada also has said it will retaliate against any US tariffs on steel and aluminum.Australia's trade minister has spoken with his US counterpart to seek an exemption to Trump administration tariffs on steel and aluminium exports.'Unfortunately, at this stage, it is not clear to me or to Australia whether or not we will be captured by the president's announcement,' Steve Ciobo told Sky News on Sunday, after speaking with US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross on Saturday.Trump officially has until April 11 to announce his final decision on a steel tariff.An analyst at Jefferies said they expected the final policy to be more nuanced than a blanket tariff, due to a mounting pushback from domestic steel consumers and foreign steel suppliers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Donald Trump cuts an erratic figure, but he has his own remorseless logic.In the form of a looming trade war the world is witnessing his refusal to be budged on core beliefs of his 'America First' doctrine.Forget the Twitter spats and feuds: the President's move to slap punitive tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US (10% on aluminium, a mighty 25% on steel) - is intended to showcase Trump-ism in action.His supporters see it as making good on his promise to focus on American interests - and it fulfils his campaign-trail promise to deal with resentments that American workers have been short-changed by free trade.In particular, he is targeting heavily-subsidised Chinese imports, which he says have destroyed American jobs in the industrial heartlands.In starting a trade war, the world is witnessing his refusal to be budged on core beliefs of his 'America First' doctrine, says Anne McElvoy, Senior Editor at The EconomistTrump does has a point about the growing impact of China on the US economy - and that of the rest of the world too.China now poses as a champion of free trade, while routinely flouting many of the rules and operating a protectionism of its own. It imposes tariffs of around 10 per cent on foreign goods - far more than America or Europe.They operate sanctions, like the denial of oil sales to North Korea. President Xi embraces globalisation in speeches - but both formal and informal restrictions make it hard for western companies to thrive in the Chinese economy.As China grows more mighty and its economy (particularly in technology) gets more sophisticated, competition with the US and indeed the rest of the world, is becoming more intense in sensitive areas. This is particularly true in the collection of personal data to enhance Artificial Intelligence (AI) and military-industrial technology. The President is not alone in worriying about Chinese robotics and AI companies using access to American firms and university research to steal intellectual property in the innovation race.If Russia now occupies the role of disruptive irritant, with crude attempts to sway election races and a cat's paw approach to testing the West's security mettle in Ukraine, Crimea and by support for anti-democratic forces in eastern Europe, it has receded as an economic and commercial threat.The stark reason is that the Chinese have advanced far faster in technology in recent years - and that Beijing is keen to weaponise these advances in an intense race with the West for prosperity and economic power.So the latest set-to on tariffs is part of a much wider potential conflict, which could involve the whole world. Merely hitting back by imposing American duties will not solve the problem. Trade between the US and China needs to come into better balance. But that will be a hard accommodation to reach, as both sides dig in on their national interest in a trade war that is about more than just steel and peanut butter.Meanwhile Trump's neighbour Canada and the EU are the territories which export the most steel to the US â€“ so the impact is already felt far beyond the US-China stand off. The move has even united fractious Europeans in condemnation. Emmanuel Macron, the EU leader who recently conducted a one-man charm offensive on a visit to Washington, has just called the President to denounce the move as 'illegal'.That will not worry Trump much: he is not a fan of the World Trade Organisation, the global rule-setting body. The greater risk, both to the US and other countries, including the UK, which are caught up in a tit-for-tat trade saga, is that blunt weapon of imposing or increasing duties on goods escalating into damaging global trade war. The more such barriers go up, the greater the likely impact on economies. It is like throwing sand in the wheels of the machinery of global trade.Mr Trump, on the other hand, hopes to stop Chinese steel reaching the US market via third-party countries. The defence of his decision (aside from the odd claim that it is based on National Security), is that the gains of liberal world trade are very far from being felt by workers in rust-belt parts of America whose jobs have been whittled away by technology or competition.And Trump opponents often glide over the fact that Democrat administrations have launched trade battles when it suited them. In the 1990s under Bill Clinton, the long-running 'banana wars' with the EU arose from protecting the interests of US multinationals in fruit production in the Caribbean.Yet the scale and impact of steel and aluminium trade wars are much greater â€“ and the gains look elusive. Mr Trump says he expects investment and new jobs to follow and many Americans believe him. In the short term, he may be able to incentivise local production and jobs, though hardly on the scale of the losses he seeks to redress.The history of governments trying to protect jobs in the steel industry is not convincing though. It most often ends up as a costly exercise in subsidy, or a postponement of job losses, rather than a lasting solution.Like industrial processes that once required intensive manpower, steel production is less labour intensive than it was.Pushing back against trade tariffs however, is difficult without unleashing a further cycle of damage. That puts big trade powers like Canada and the EU in an unenviable position â€“ can they both defend free trade as a principle â€“ and join in a tit-for-tat tussle over tariffs?Anne McElvoy warns that trade wars like the one started by Donald Trump are often complicated and the consumer almost always bears the brunt of them with price risesChina now poses as a champion of free trade, but McElvoy says President Xi Jinping (pictured) makes it tough for western companies to thrive in his country's economyTrump's trade war has been criticised by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (left) and French President Emmanuel Macron (right)The instant response from EU officials has been to talk big â€“ and act small. The EU has announced plans to impose its own tariffs on motorcycles imports â€“ and is dangling the prospect of more, on orange juice, whisky, peanut butter and Levi's jeans, among other popular consumer goods. That would hit American exporters and is also intended to increase pressure on the President among pro-business Republicans. And European shoppers will be disgruntled to find the row leads to higher till prices too.So far, the EU response is modest, because the aim is to present a united front with Mexico and Canada.Ultimately though, the tariff deadlock could extend from steel (which does not much affect the EU in volume of exports), to cars. This is a particular problem for Germany, but also in other EU countries with automobile and associated industries.If the detail is complicated, the principle if simple. Trade wars, once started, are devilishly hard to stop. And whatever the intentions, the consumer always bears the brunt of the backlash.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Planes are seen under construction at a Boeing assembly plant in North Charleston, South Carolina -- which President Donald Trump visited a year ago to cries of 'God Bless Boeing'The sparkling new Boeing 787s bound for China Southern Airlines and Air China are waiting to be delivered, but the prospect of a trade war could make for a less rosy future.At this Boeing manufacturing plant in Charleston, South Carolina -- which President Donald Trump visited a year ago to cries of 'God Bless Boeing' -- the trade battle he unleashed with Beijing last week is far off.Or so it seems. Like the company itself, workers at the plant, which produces the Boeing 787 and where unions have struggled to organize the labor force, say little when the question comes up.But the threat of losing export markets is still clear and present.'Unfortunately, Boeing makes an easy target for anyone wishing to retaliate against the new US trade measures,' Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group, told AFP.A flagship of US industry and one of the best known American brands, the company says it is the largest US exporter because about 80 percent of its planes are for export.As a result, any trade major conflict would leave the company dangerously exposed -- in particular one involving the world's fastest growing aviation market in China.Boeing was one of the first companies Trump attacked on Twitter, when he threatened to cancel an order for a new presidential plane he said was too expensive.The company has managed to work its way back into the president's good graces, with its share price up 129 percent since the election in November 2016.But since peaking in February, Boeing's shares are down more than 10 percent as investors consider the company's prospects in the new trade environment Trump has created.At least in the short term, the company has little to fear, with a healthy order portfolio of 5,864 planes -- meaning it will be in constant production through 2024.Furthermore, China, where air travel is booming, can scarcely afford to push its partly state-owned domestic carriers to cancel their orders or boycott the US manufacturer because they simply have no alternative, experts say.- Where China could strike Boeing -The Chinese manufacturer Comac, which soon hopes to market its C919 -- a potential competitor to the mid-range Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 jets -- is not yet ready for large-scale production. The plane had its first test flight in December.'In the best case scenario, Comac will need another five or six years to reach a respectable production capacity,' said Michel Merluzeau, an analyst at AirInsight.Meanwhile, Airbus, Boeing's main competitor, also has a healthy backlog of orders and its suppliers are already struggling to keep up with the speedy new pace of production.'In the short term, China has no choice if it doesn't want to put the brakes on the growth of its air transport sector,' according to Merluzeau.Boeing is also due to open a new finishing center for its medium-range 737 jets in Zhoushan, south of Shanghai, this year. And Beijing will certainly do nothing to jeopardize that, added Merluzeau.When Boeing considers the longer term, however, its grounds for self-confidence become shakier.Scott Hamilton, managing director at aviation consultants Leeham Company, said China can use industrial orders for political messaging.'If China were to retaliate against Boeing, it would more likely be in freezing new orders for an indefinite time, placing them with rival Airbus instead,' he told AFP.Aboulafia of Teal Group agrees: 'A few large block orders for Airbus would send a strong message, particularly if China abstains from any Boeing orders for some time,' he said.Between January of 2016 and the start of this year, China accounted for a fifth of all Boeing's deliveries, or 303 out of 1511 aircraft received by commercial air carriers, according to the company's figures.The company's order backlog also shows China's share of Boeing deliveries set to grow, analysts say.Furthermore, Beijing could frustrate Boeing's plans to expand into the so-called mid-market by introducing a new jet in the 220-to-260-seat range, an industry segment where Airbus currently has a head start.'Chinese air carriers would only have to place a few large orders of A330-800neo and A321neo jets to hurt the newer aircraft's potential,' said Merluzeau of AirInsight.Other countries in addition to China could also retaliate against Boeing because of President Donald Trump's promised new tariffs.Brazil, for example, could block Boeing's efforts to form a commercial jet joint venture with the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trump fired another shot in his trade war with European allies, threatening to impose a 20 per cent tariff on European autos.Trump blasted steep European Union import duties on U.S. cars, a month after his administration began an investigation of whether European duties on cars posed a threat to U.S. national security.Trump leveled the threat hours after the EU slapped $3.3 billion tariffs on U.S. products. Those tariffs were structured in a way so as to try to drive attention and target particular Republican strongholds â€“ with tariffs on bourbon and Harley Davidson motorcycles.That action was a response to Trump's decision to impose a 25 per cent tax on steel and a 10 per cent tax on aluminum â€“ and to not exempt European allies from the tariff.President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 20 per cent tariff on European autos'Build them here!'

We will do what we have to do to rebalance and safeguard,' he said.European consumers would be able to find 'alternatives', European Commission Vice President for trade Jyrki Katainen said.'If we chose products like Harley Davidson, peanut butter and bourbon, it's because there are alternatives on the market. We don't want to do anything that would harm consumers,' he said on Thursday.'What's more, these products will have a strong symbolic political impact.'International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Christine Lagarde warned on Thursday that trade war, as well as Brexit, were the key risks to the eurozone economy.While she didn't see a serious 'direct impact of tariff increases... it's a trend that is worrying, the breach of confidence that undermines confidence,' she said on the sidelines of eurozone minister talks in Luxembourg.- Relations reach new lows -Transatlantic ties are at their lowest level for many years due to rows over a host of issues including the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal.Relations plumbed new depths at the recent G7 summit when Trump abruptly rejected the joint statement and bitterly insulted his Canadian host, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Harley Davidson motorbikes are among the US products facing EU tariffsTrump claimed America had been obliged to levy the metals tariffs as it has been exploited as the world's 'piggy bank'.

"Containers are loaded onto shipping vessels at the Port of Long Beach in CaliforniaChurning out everything from cars and computer chips to nuts and wine, California's mighty economy will suffer big time if the US-China trade war worsens.Billions of dollars and many jobs are at risk in the richest and most populous US state -- a world-class economy and bastion of opposition to President Donald Trump.'If there's one region in the United States that will be most impacted by the trade war, it's going to be LA,' said Stephen Cheung, former director of international trade at the Port of Los Angeles and now chairman of an NGO called World Trade Center Los Angeles.Last year in Los Angeles-area ports, two-way trade with China totaled more than $170 billion, Cheung said.'China is our number one trading partner,' he told AFP.The world's two largest economies have squared off in a tit for tat trade war that threatens to disrupt international commerce.'Our fear is that the cycle will keep growing to the point where it's going to depress the economy,' said Cheung.- 'Very concerned' -Mexican farm workers harvest lettuce in a field outside Brawley, CaliforniaCalifornia boasts the world's fifth largest economy, with annual output of $2.7 billion, more than that of Britain.The state of 40 million people is home to the powerful tech companies of Silicon Valley and the Hollywood movie and TV industry.The state exports electric cars, engines, auto parts and aluminum, besides being the nation's bread basket.Pistachios, almonds, oranges, walnuts, plums, lemons and strawberries are among the farm products targeted in Chinese tariffs imposed in retaliation for US levies ordered by Trump.'Although we don't know the exact ramifications these tariffs will have on our crops, we do understand the loss of the Chinese market will result in other foreign suppliers moving into the marketplace, causing long-term lost sales opportunities for our farmers,' said Sara Neagu-Reed of the California Farm Bureau Federation.China was the third largest market in 2016 for California farm goods, after Canada and the European Union, with imports to the tune of $2 billion.'We as growers are very concerned,' said Holly King, head of the Almond Board of California. The sector exported $518 million worth of almonds in 2016. Now, the nut has been hit with a 50 percent tariff in China.For pistachios -- $530 million in exports that year -- the levy is 45 percent.Casey Creamer, executive vice president of the California Citrus Mutual, which represents 2,500 growers, said the organization's focus for now is on supporting the US government in the face of Chinese trade practices which 'have been very bad for our industry.'Trump, who says he wants to reduce the US trade deficit with China, has accused other countries of taking advantage of the US when it comes to bilateral trade.Many producers agree that China has engaged in unfair practices but 'instead of using trade tariffs as a tactic' the better approach is to negotiate toward an accord that benefits both sides, said Cheung.- 'Frustrating' -A worker reaches for grapes during a harvest operation in October 2017 in Kenwood, CaliforniaWine was slapped with a 35 percent tariff in China, which hurts Michael Honig, who owns a winery in Napa Valley north of San Francisco.'We started exporting to China over 10 years ago and built up a good market,' he told AFP.

"BEIJING, July 13 (Reuters) - A hotel in the Chinese city of Shenzhen plans to charge its U.S. guests an extra 25 percent amid a trade war between Beijing and Washington, according to the Global Times, a tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily.The Modern Classic Hotel Group had put up a notice at its hotel informing guests of the extra charge on American guests, the paper said in a report dated Thursday.'We put up the notice last Friday. Our boss was really angry about the endless tariffs the U.S. planned to impose on China, so we decided to stand with the country and show our support,' a spokesperson of the hotel surnamed Yang told the paper.People answering the phone on Friday at numbers on the hotel's website said they were unaware of the policy.There has been little public evidence to date of anti-American activity in China as the trade dispute has grown increasingly bitter.The United States and China each imposed a 25 percent tariff on $34 billion worth of the other's goods on July 6. This week, Washington published a new set of proposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of goods from China, further escalating the conflict.'Chinese public sentiment towards the U.S. is becoming more sensitive' after Washington's latest tariff threats, the hawkish tabloid said in its report.Several sources have told Reuters that China issued strict guidelines to its media barring personal attacks on U.S. President Donald Trump and limiting open commentary, an apparent attempt to avoid unintentional escalation.Authorities were also censoring potentially sensitive items on social media such as Weibo, China's Twitter-like service, where trade-related items have been mostly kept off the list of top trending topics.There have been signs of Chinese citizens taking matters into their hands, however: a picture of a sign at a restaurant serving Hunan cuisine informing U.S. tourists of an extra 25 percent charge circulated on domestic and international social media. The origin of the photo could not immediately be confirmed.Official Chinese statements this week have taken a sharper tone, accusing the United States of 'bullying' and starting the trade war.

"Beijing agreed in a joint statement with the U.S. to 'substantially reduce' America's trade deficit with ChinaWASHINGTON â€” The United States and China are pulling back from the brink of a trade war after the world's two biggest economies reported progress in talks aimed at bringing down America's massive trade deficit with Beijing.'We are putting the trade war on hold,' Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday.After high-level talks Thursday and Friday in Washington, Beijing agreed in a joint statement with the U.S. to 'substantially reduce' America's trade deficit with China, but did not commit to cut the gap by any specific amount. The Trump administration had sought to slash the deficit by $200 billion.Still, Mnuchin said the two countries had made 'meaningful progress' and that the administration has agreed to put on hold proposed tariffs on up to $150 billion in Chinese products. China had promised to retaliate in a move that threatened a tit for tat trade war.He said they expect to see a big increase â€” 35 percent to 45 percent this year alone â€” in U.S. farm sales to China. Mnuchin also forecast a doubling in sales of U.S. energy products to the Chinese market, increasing energy exports by $50 billion to $60 billion in the next three years to five years.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has been part of the U.S. negotiating team, will go to China soon to follow up on last week's discussions, Mnuchin said.In Saturday's statement, Beijing committed to 'significantly increase' its purchases of American goods and services, saying the increase would 'meet the growing consumption needs of the Chinese people and the need for high-quality economic development.'Last year, the U.S. had a record $376 billion deficit with China in the trade of goods; that was the largest by far with any nation.Trade analysts were not surprised that China refused to agree to a numerical target for cutting the trade gap, but they said the talks probably were more successful in easing trade tensions.'The Trump administration seems eager to engineer at minimum a temporary peace with China to ensure a smooth run-up to the Kim-Trump summit in June,' Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad said, referring to the June 12 meeting scheduled between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.If there is success in the U.S.-China discussions, analysts suggest it likely would involve the countries' presidents this fall before the November elections.'Part of the good news for markets: As long as both sides continue to be 'constructively' engaged, imposition of additional tariffs by either side is very unlikely,' analysts at investment management firm Evercore ISI said in a research note. 'There is no reason for either side â€” particularly the U.S. â€” to destroy the process that both sides are building, which is what imposing tariffs would do.'Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., praised the administration's efforts with China.'It's smart to engage China on trade abuses, and it would also be smart to get them more involved in trying to help us with North Korea,' Graham said.Trump campaigned in 2016 on a pledge to get tough on China and other U.S. trading partners. He views the U.S. trade deficit with China as evidence that Beijing is engaged in abusive trading practices and has outmaneuvered previous U.S. administrations.Last August, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer began investigating Beijing's strong-arm tactics to challenge U.S. technological dominance. These include outright cybertheft of U.S. companies' trade secrets and China's demands that American corporations hand over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese markets.Last month, the administration proposed tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports to protest the forced technology transfers. Trump later ordered Lighthizer to seek up to an additional $100 billion in Chinese products to tax.China responded by targeting $50 billion in U.S. products, including soybeans â€” a shot at Trump supporters in America's heartland. The prospect of an escalating trade war has shaken financial markets and alarmed business leaders.In a separate controversy, the Commerce Department last month blocked China's ZTE Corp. from importing American components for seven years, accusing the telecommunications company of misleading U.S. regulators after it settled charges last year of violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea.The ban amounted to a death sentence for ZTE, which relies heavily on U.S. parts, and the company announced that it was halting operations. A week ago, Trump tweeted that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to put ZTE 'back in business, fast.' Media reports suggested that the U.S. was offering to swap a ZTE rescue for an end to proposed Chinese tariffs on U.S. farm products.Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called Trump's intervention in the case 'outrageous' and said that using ZTE 'as a bargaining chip ... is not in the best interests of our national security.'White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said there could be 'some small changes around the edges' in the sanctions against ZTE. But Kudlow added: 'Do not expect ZTE to get off scot-free. It ain't gonna happen.'Mnuchin and Graham appeared on 'Fox News Sunday,' Warner spoke on CNN's 'State of the Union' and Kudlow was interviewed on ABC's 'This Week.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Japan agreed Wednesday to negotiate a trade pact with the United States, easing fears that President Donald Trump would zero in on the US ally for his next tariff offensive.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Trump, meeting on the sidelines of the annual UN General Assembly session, said they would open talks on goods with a view to building freer trade.In a joint statement, Trump and Abe pledged to 'refrain from taking measures against the spirit' of their understanding for as long as negotiations go on.Abe, addressing reporters afterward, said Japan understood that the agreement meant the United States would not take any action under so-called Section 232 -- a US legal clause, of which Trump has become fond, that allows Washington to restrict imports due to concerns over national security.'We must not set the hands of the clock backward,' Abe said, calling instead for the two countries to 'reinvigorate our mutual trade and investment.'Abe formed an early bond with Trump after the real estate tycoon's unexpected election victory, with the two leaders since chatting more than two dozen times on the telephone, according to officials.But Trump, who became a business celebrity in the 1980s when Japan's economic miracle looked unstoppable, has grumbled about the US trade deficit with Japan.He recently told The Wall Street Journal that while he had good relations with Japan, 'Of course, that will end as soon as I tell them how much they have to pay.'Speaking as he announced the trade negotiations with Abe, Trump said: 'Japan is very smart. Great negotiators. And, you know, up until now, they've done very well, and they'll continue to do very well.'Trump this week slapped $200 billion of tariffs on China, which also has a large trade surplus with the United States, and on Wednesday he bluntly said that his onetime friendship with Chinese President Xi Jinping could be over.He has also imposed sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum even from allies such as the European Union and Canada, citing Section 232.- No US return to Pacific pact -The United States and Japan, the world's first and third largest economies, together make up about 30 percent of global GDP and have long had trade ties that are both fractious and interconnected.Abe took political risks at home in 2013 by entering negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, conceived as a vast bloc across both sides of the Pacific which would help build US influence in Asia in the face of growing Chinese influence.But Trump withdrew from the TPP days after taking office, fulfilling a campaign promise aimed at blue-collar workers.Abe had previously voiced hope that the United States would return but agreed to the bilateral talks amid growing concern about Trump's intentions.'The president is not going to join the TPP. But this is a very important step, in terms of expanding our relationship with Japan,' US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told reporters on a conference call.The proposed trade deal would only focus on goods and would not be a full-fledged free trade agreement, a much more complex and time-consuming deal that also looks at the service sector.Atsuyuki Oike, Japan's deputy chief negotiator for the TPP, said the bilateral agreement could also clear the groundwork if the United States eventually comes back to the broader pact.'If it's concluded, it's not a minus. It's actually a plus,' he said, pointing out that much of TPP negotiations boiled down to individual countries sorting out arrangements on goods.- Trump presses on cars -Trump has been especially perturbed over the imbalance in auto sales, with Japanese cars a constant sight on US streets but few Japanese buying from the Detroit Big Three, preferring smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles.Abe, however, stressed that Japanese automakers manufacture twice as many cars inside the United States as they export to the country.In another figure he hoped would raise Trump's attention, Abe said that Japan supported 856,000 jobs in the United States -- more than any country except Britain.In the joint statement, the United States raised concerns about auto access and Japan highlighted sensitivities over its tightly protected agricultural sector.But Oike said that the statement did not prejudge the course of negotiations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo vowed that the United States would emerge victorious in an intensifying trade war with China, a day before Washington imposes $200 billion worth of tariffs.'We are going to win it,' Pompeo said in an interview on Fox News broadcast Sunday.'We're going to get an outcome which forces China to behave in a way that if you want to be a power -- a global power -- transparency, rule of law, you don't steal intellectual property,' he said.Pompeo said that President Donald Trump 'very much likes' his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping but said he would press policies that 'the American workers deserve.'Even before Trump's election, the United States has complained vigorously that China has been unfair to US businesses and has stolen technology by forcing firms to reveal secrets as a condition to operate in the fast-growing Asian economy.But Trump has taken an increasingly hard line on trade around the world, with $200 billion in tariffs on Chinese exports set to take effect on Monday.China has retaliated by hitting $60 billion in US products and the world's two largest economies have already imposed tariffs of $50 billion on each other.In a first, the Trump administration has also punished a unit of China's defense ministry for buying fighter jets and missiles from Russia in defiance of sanctions on Moscow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Trump's trade war with China is over, at least temporarily, and here's the after-action report: Advantage, China.There's no denying that stubborn imbalances have built up in the United States' bilateral economic relationship with China; nor have past administrations succeeded in getting Beijing to address those through conventional diplomatic means. Trump's more confrontational approach, including his threat to impose tariffs, might have been worth a try, had he pursued the right goals.As the reported terms of the Trump administration's truce with China show, however, Trump to date seems to have spent American leverage on a predictably futile effort to achieve large short-term reductions in the $375 billion annual U.S. merchandise trade deficit with China. He agreed to withdraw tariff threats in return for China doing the same with its counterthreat, plus promises from Beijing to buy more U.S. agricultural goods and liquefied natural gas. These U.S. sales won't dent the trade deficit, and they will simply shift global trade flows rather than expand them because China was already in the market for these raw materials. Nor will China's ballyhooed reduction in auto tariffs from 25 percent to 15 percent do much to change foreign firms' overwhelming incentives to build cars in China as opposed to export them there from the United States.Meanwhile, China has achieved important objectives, both tangible and intangible. In the tangible category, the most important is the president's apparent willingness to back off a seven-year ban on U.S. sales of components to the Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE, which would have crippled that firm. The U.S. ban was punishment for serious violations of U.S. national-security-related laws, specifically, ZTE's business dealings with Iran and North Korea and the company's subsequent lies in its initial settlement with the United States. Trump has indicated now, however, that, in deference to his good relationship with Chinese dictator Xi Jinping, the United States would settle for a fine and changes to ZTE management. That's an intangible victory for China, too, in that it shows the United States will treat national-security policy as a subject of trade negotiation. Also favorable to China is the revelation that Trump's policy team is deeply divided and is susceptible to pressure from America's politically pivotal farm belt.From the start, the administration should have focused on the truly important and legitimate U.S. grievances with China: that country's restrictions on foreign investment, its intellectual-property theft and its attempts to dominate future high-tech industries. On these structural issues, Chinese policy remains the same; Trump, by showing that he defines victory as selling more U.S. raw materials, gives Beijing no reason to change.Perhaps this unfavorable truce was the best Trump could achieve at a time when he also needs Xi's help dealing with North Korea. Yet that conflict of interest, too, was foreseeable. No one ever said winning a trade war would be easy, except for the one person who has just proved that it's not.The Washington Post",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US President Donald Trump escalated a growing trade war with China by unveiling plans on Tuesday to impose 10 per cent tariffs on an additional USD 200 billion worth of Chinese goods.With the world's two largest economies already engaged in a confrontation long feared by markets and industry, Trump said he was pushing forward with fresh punitive measures over Beijing's 'unacceptable' move to raise its own tariffs.'Further action must be taken to encourage China to change its unfair practices, open its market to United States goods and accept a more balanced trade relationship with the United States,' Trump said in a statement.The US leader warned that after the new measures are in place -- on top of existing 25% tariffs on USD 50 billion in Chinese imports -- tariffs on another USD 200 billion of Chinese goods would go forward 'if China increases its tariffs yet again.' 'The trade relationship between the United States and China must be much more equitable,' the president said in explaining his decision.'I have an excellent relationship with President Xi (Jinping), and we will continue working together on many issues. But the United States will no longer be taken advantage of on trade by China and other countries in the world.' Trump had already warned last week of 'additional tariffs' should Beijing hit back with tit-for-tat duties on American goods.Also read Imposing tariff on China not the right approach: US industryThen China followed suit, unveiling 25% duties on USD 50 billion in US imports -- matching the US rates.Trump moved forward with measures after months of sometimes fraught shuttle diplomacy in which Chinese offers to purchase more American goods failed to assuage his grievances over the soaring trade imbalance and China's aggressive industrial development policies.And the China trade offensive is only one side of Trump's multi-front battle with all major US economic partners.'China apparently has no intention of changing its unfair practices related to the acquisition of American intellectual property and technology,' Trump said in a statement.'Rather than altering those practices, it is now threatening United States companies, workers, and farmers who have done nothing wrong.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Send Facebook google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/2tbCX US steel tariffs: A new trade war?Tusk warned Trump that the tariffs could result in 'a serious trade dispute' between Washington and the rest of the world.He suggested that there should be 'an extraordinary trade debate' over possible 'repercussions for our citizens and our businesses not to mention the global economy,' at an upcoming EU leaders summit in Brussels this month.EU trade commissioner responds'We ... hope to convince the US administration that this is not the right move,' EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said.'But we have made clear that if a move like this is taken, it will hurt the European Union, it will put thousands of European jobs in jeopardy, and it has to be met by a firm and proportionate response,' she added.US motive an 'economic safeguard'Trump's motivations did not appear compatible with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and that meant the EU could take precautions to protect its own markets, Malmstroem said.She added that the EU 'seriously doubts' Trump wanted tariffs on steel for national security reasons.'We have serious doubts about that justification. We cannot see how the European Union, friends and allies in NATO, can be a threat to international security in the US,' Malmstrom said.'From what we understand, the motivation of the US is an economic safeguard measure in disguise, not a national security measure,' she added.Watch video 01:48 Now live 01:48 mins. EU's Trump tariffs riposte based on WTO rulesWTO without the US?The chairman of the European parliament's Committee on International Trade, Bernd Lange, echoed Malmstroem's criticism regarding the violation of WTO rules, saying: 'This is not about anti-dumping measures, rather it is about closing off access to the US market. That is clearly a violation of WTO rules.'Lange even spoke of a future in which the US would no longer be a member of the WTO if the president insisted on flouting the body's rules. Trump himself has repeatedly threatened to leave the WTO in order to secure more favorable bilateral trade agreements for the US.Know your historyIn her remarks, Malmstroem made a point of referencing former US President George W. Bush's anti-dumping tariffs from 2002. The result of that decision cost thousands of jobs and led to the decimation of the US steel industry: 'I hope someone in the White House reminds him of that.'Chances of internal resistance to protectionism within the Trump administration grew more unlikely when top economic advisor Gary Cohn announced his pending resignation Tuesday. Cohn, a Democrat, was one of the few people in the administration who vocally championed free trade. The stance drew an increasing amount of derision from the president, who chided him for being a 'globalist.'Concrete stepsTrade Commissioner Malmstroem promised three steps would be taken by the EU should Trump follow through with the threat of raising import tariffs, saying:1. The EU will lodge a formal complaint with the WTO, possibly alongside other steel and aluminum producing countries like Canada, Brazil, Japan and China.2. The EU will reciprocally raise import tariffs on US steel and aluminum.3. The EU will raise tariffs on US-made motorcycles, bourbon whisky, jeans, peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice and other iconic US products in an effort to offset European economic loses.Speaking of the measures, Malmstroem said that the European Commission is responsible for protecting EU jobs. She emphasized her lack of desire to impose such new tariffs but added she may have no choice in the matter: 'We really don't want to, but we cannot remain silent.'International warningsThe EU was not the only international entity to voice concern over a looming trade war. On Wednesday, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), warned: 'In a so-called trade war â€¦ nobody wins, one generally finds loser on both sides.' She said that a trade war would cause 'formidable' damage to global economic growth.Speaking in Geneva, where a number of countries, among them China, voiced concern about Trump's threats, World Trade Organization spokesman Keith Rockwell said: 'Many said they feared a tit-for-tat retaliation which could spiral out of control, damaging the global economy and the multilateral trading system.'Canada's ambassador to the WTO was quoted as saying: 'We fear that the United States may be opening a Pandora's Box that we would not be able to close.'How the commotion beganLast Thursday Trump declared that the US would impose a 25-percent tariff on steel imports and a 10-percent tariff on aluminum.Then on Saturday, he tweeted that the US would place 'a tax' on European cars that 'freely pour into the US' if the EU further increased tariffs. Trade Commissioner Malmstroem countered that argument by warning that such a move could lead to thousands of job losses at European automobile manufacturers, many of whom have major production facilities in the USA.She also cited the fact that although import tariffs on European cars are indeed low, that is offset by much higher import tariffs on European trucks.js,law/sms (AFP, AP, dpa)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Chinaâ€™s trade war with the U.S. is expected to prolong, given that both the parties are playing hardball, noted Nordea Bank in a research report. Market sentiment is expected to stay negative, with the CNY and CNH staying under pressure. A currency war has several risks so China might intervene to avoid that.The trade war with U.S. has heightened with Trump raising the amount of Chinese goods subject to tariffs to a total of USD 250 billion. He also threatened to ultimately tax all imports from China but so far only gave details to USD 250 billion, noted Nordea Bank.China continued to keep its defensive strategy and displayed no willingness to back down. China announced retaliation tariffs of USD 60 billion in early August, making the total amount of American goods subject to tariffs to USD 110 billion.The Trump administration is overlooking the trade war having possible adverse effects on the U.S. China might rather endure the negative impact from the trade war than concede to U.S. demand, stated Nordea Bank.The deteriorating conflict has affected market sentiment in China more than in the U.S. The CNY depreciated 7 percent against the USD and 5 percent against the basket since mid-June.â€œAlthough a weaker yuan is tempting to Beijing, we do not think it is interested in a currency war, which bears many risks. At the same time, there are also costs to heavily intervene in the FX market to counter market pressure.

"Theresa May has told Donald Trump of her â€œdeep concernâ€? at the presidentâ€™s plan to introduce tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the United States which have sparked fears of a trade war.It comes after the Prime Ministerâ€™s de facto deputy, David Lidington, rebuked Mr Trump for threatening a trade battle with the European Union.Following a phone call between Mrs May and the president on Sunday, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: â€œThe Prime Minister raised our deep concern at the Presidentâ€™s forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all partiesâ€™ interests.â€?It marks the latest of the pairâ€™s clashes, following disagreements over Mr Trumpâ€™s retweeting of anti-Muslim videos posted by the far-right group Britain First, and his recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.In a further escalation, Mr Trump has said the US â€œwill simply apply a TAXâ€? on cars made in Europe if the EU retaliates against the trade penalties he is seeking on imports of steel and aluminium.If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2018Mr Lidington told BBC Oneâ€™s Sunday Politics programme: â€œI just think that the United States is not taking an advisable course in threatening a trade war.â€œTrade wars donâ€™t do anybody any good.â€?Brussels is promising retaliation against American exports if Mr Trump follows through on his idea, which he is warning he will do next week.But the president responded, saying on Twitter: â€œIf the EU wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on US companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the US. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!â€?Mr Lidington suggested the American authorities could overrule any tariffs, as they did in the case of aircraft manufacturer Bombardier when Mr Trumpâ€™s administration threatened huge duties on its C-wing planes.The minister said: â€œWeâ€™ll have to see what happens, I mean there was a lot of concerns recently about something comparable with regards aviation and the aircraft that were being produced in part by Bombardier in Belfast in Northern Ireland, and the American authorities at the end of the day struck that down, they said no that is not the way that we should be going.â€?The Bombardier Aerospace plant in Belfast (Niall Carson/PA)And he warned Mr Trump that Britainâ€™s experience showed his plan would not work.â€œWe tried in Britain in the 60s and 70s protecting our car industry from competition,â€?

"The head of the World Trade Organization (WTO) told member states on Monday they must prevent 'the fall of the first dominoes' in a trade war and warned of a real risk of triggering an escalation of global trade barriers and a deep recession.World trade policy is in turmoil because of US President Donald Trump's announcement last week that he planned to put controversial tariffs on steel and aluminium, prompting threats of tit-for-tat actions and concerns for the trade system itself.Advertisement'We must make every effort to avoid the fall of the first dominoes. There is still time,' WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo told the heads of WTO delegations at a closed-door meeting in Geneva.'In light of recent announcements on trade policy measures, it is clear that we now see a much higher and real risk of triggering an escalation of trade barriers across the globe,' Azevedo said, according to a copy of his statement released by the WTO.AdvertisementAzevedo is normally very conservative in remarks about WTO members' trade policies, but he also plays a role as a guardian of the global trading rules, a bulwark against protectionism.On Friday he broke his silence on Trump's tariff plan, expressing concern and saying a trade war would be in nobody's interest.In his statement at Monday's meeting, he did not name any one country but sounded a more urgent warning.'Once we start down this path it will be very difficult to reverse direction. An eye for an eye will leave us all blind and the world in a deep recession,' Azevedo said.Trade officials said that many diplomats at the meeting voiced concern about protectionism, and 11, including the 28-state European Union, expressed very strong concerns about Trump's announcement on Thursday specifically.As well as the EU, Mexico, Japan, Australia, China, South Korea, Brazil, Norway, Canada, India and Venezuela all warned of the knock-on effect of Trump's action and urged the United States to think again.Trade officials said the US representative at the meeting, originally called to discuss a recent ministerial conference in Argentina, spoke only about the original agenda without mentioning the furore over the US tariff plan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By Arab NewsBy Frank Kane*The opening salvos of a full-blown global trade war are rumbling closer by the day, and indeed may already have been fired with the decision by US authorities to consider big tariffs on aluminum and steel imports.How it develops from here will determine many other crucial factors on the world scene, from the benign economic growth projections most experts have been making this year, through to the most important geopolitical relationship in the world, that between the US and China.If it escalates further, the Middle East will be left â€” geographically and metaphorically â€” hanging between these two giant economic powers. The regionâ€™s long-term commercial orientation could well be decided by the outcome of the conflict currently simmering over allegedly unfair practices in global trade.It has been brewing for some time, since Donald Trump was elected US president on a protectionist ticket designed to put â€œAmerica Firstâ€? in everything. His electioneering rhetoric has been reinforced by post-inauguration actions like withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and repeated threats against the North American Free Trade Agreement.Trump says he is not anti-trade, merely anti-unfair trade. But you get the feeling he is actually railing against the economic advantages China enjoys, as a low-cost manufacturer and exporter, over the US. Put simply, China is better at making and selling things, especially basic products and processed commodities, than the Americans.For Trump, this is another galling aspect to how he sees the world, and in particular the relationship with the rising economic and military power of China. Add to this increasing military tensions in the oceans off the Asia-Pacific coast, and competition between them in places like the Middle East and South America, which the Americans long regarded as their back-yard but in which the Chinese are now investing heavily, and it is the perfect storm of commercial rivalry.Under the Trump administration, such concerns have taken on a strategic importance. The most recent moves, on the face of it, were about mundane issues like subsidizing and dumping steel and aluminum on the US, but the way the official recommendation from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was framed tells just how important the Americans regard it.Rising imports of these metals â€œthreaten to impair the national security,â€? Ross concluded. Although China was not specifically mentioned in the complaint, there was no doubt whom he had identified as the culprits. The Chinese in effect owned up, with an equally bellicose statement that talked about â€œChinaâ€™s interestsâ€? and â€œour legitimate rights.â€?Trump had ratcheted it up even further in a recent speech with a statement that â€œif we ever have a conflict we donâ€™t want to be buying steel from a country we are fighting.â€? That is, literally, fighting talk.Rossâ€™s recommendation â€” that the US should impose a 24 percent import tax on steel and 7.7 percent on aluminum â€” has not yet been implemented, but if it were put in place the Chinese are likely to retaliate with taxes on American agricultural produce and animal feeds which form a big part of the import balance from the US.It could get even further out of hand if European, Canadian and South American exporters also feel the US tariffs are directed against them too.If it ends up as the US against the world, that could hit world trade patterns hard, and also bring down the economic growth rates that are so closely connected with trade and commerce. It could be a global commercial armageddon, and the effects of that are almost impossible to predict but are genuinely worrying.One historian on Twitter yesterday reminded us that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, which brought the Americans into World War II, was in supposed retaliation for an embargo on US oil exports to Japan.It does not have to go that way, of course. If ever there was a time for the World Trade Organization to show off its negotiating expertise, which Director-General Roberto Azevedo was lauding at a summit in Dubai last week, it is now.If the American claims were tested in some form of international arbitration forum it might at least provide an opportunity to assess who is right and wrong.If the WTO cannot talk some sense into them, the Middle East could get caught in the crossfire of a global trade war. The region is only on the edge of the current conflict, because it does not manufacture and export very much apart from crude oil and gas, which of course have their own issues.But demand for those energy products depends largely on the needs of industrial and commercial producers, especially in China, which is the regionâ€™s biggest customer for crude and increasingly for gas too. If the Chinese and other Asian economies slow down as a result of a trade war, it is bad news for the regionâ€™s biggest export earner.A trade war would have a broader regional relevance too. The defining trend of global economics since the great financial crisis of 2008 has been the switch away from the West, which was blamed for the carnage, toward the East, where the commitment to recovery policies helped get the world out of the mess.In particular, Central Asia and the Middle East have enthusiastically bought in to Chinaâ€™s â€œOne Belt, One Roadâ€? strategy that ties them more closely to Chinese trade.A US-inspired trade war would surely confirm the impression that the Americans are increasingly untrustworthy in their economic and commercial relations with the Middle East, where many have accused them of disengaging on the political front. It would be in absolutely nobodyâ€™s interest.*Frank Kane is an award-winning business journalist based in Dubai.

"By RSISAlthough the prospect of a trade war between US and other economies looms large, the actual confrontation could still be evaded. But even if a trade war does not occur, the world is not off the hook as the US is having another tool in the pipeline which may in the future be wielded against friends and foes alike.By Kaewkamol Pitakdumrongkit*Few other things are making headlines as much as a potential trade war after President Donald Trump declared that the United States would impose tariffs on steel and aluminium from Canada, Mexico, the European Union (EU) and China. Such a move unsurprisingly has created uproar around the world.The prospect looks grimmer when the trading partners vowed to retaliate. For example, Canada is planning to slap up to 25% tariffs on US$13 billion of American goods targeting steel and whiskey. Mexicoâ€™s tariffs are aimed at US steel and agricultural goods. EUâ€™s countermeasures consist of 25% duties on about 200 American products such as motorcycles, cigarette, and bourbon whiskey. As for China, the US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Rossâ€™ negotiation with Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He in Beijing recently yielded no new agreement.Looming Trade WarRight after the talk, Beijing on 4 June 2018 warned that if Washington actually slapped tariffs on $50 billion of its exports scheduled to take place later this month, â€œthen all the economic and trade benefits negotiated by both sides are not going to take effectâ€?. In response to the Trump administrationâ€™s plan to impose new tariff measures aimed at Chinaâ€™s high-tech manufacturing sectors, Beijing said it would counter with duties on several American products namely autos, soybeans, and airplanes.As the world is inching closer to a trade war, one should, however, not feel entirely hopeless. Some efforts have been made to turn the tide in a more positive direction. For instance, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire announced after the G7 finance ministersâ€™ and central bank governorsâ€™ meeting in Canada: â€œWe still have a few days to take the necessary steps to avoid a trade war between the EU and the US, and to avoid a trade war among G7 members.â€?Economists and trade experts wasted no time to strongly oppose a trade war and pointed to evidence that no one would win from such a showdown. Mark Zandi, a chief economist at Moodyâ€™s Analytics, posited that taking the Sino-US trade war alone, it would cost 190,000 American jobs. Moreover, Trumpâ€™s tariffs triggered anxiety among certain American constituencies, namely wheat growers.Every year the US produces about 60 million tonnes of wheat with almost half of which are geared for exports. Tariffs on US agricultural products will surely not bode well for these farmers especially when the harvesting season just starts.The recent interplay suggests that the outcome can be one of these two possibilities ? a trade war, or not. But despite scary prospects, such war may not happen. Perhaps Washington and the other countries may manage to evade it with adept diplomacy.The US may come to realise the non-commercial consequences of its tariff policy such as alienating allies it needs to advance its security or defence cooperation, and hence reverse its course. Perhaps pressure and outcry from American farmers or voters can finally get President Trumpâ€™s ear and change his mind. As a result, the world can once again breathe itself a sigh of relief.If Tariffs Are Bad, Investment Restrictions Are WorseSuppose a trade war does not occur, the worldâ€™s economy is not yet off the hook. Future disruptions can still be caused by the USâ€™ restrictions on international investment between it and other economies. The bipartisan Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernisation Act (FIRRMA)â€™s two versions were approved by the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee on 22 and 24 May 2018 respectively.Although some differences between these two bills need to be ironed out, the Act will likely expand the authority of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) â€“ an inter-agency committee mandated to review transactions that could lead to foreign acquisitions of American businesses to determine their effects on the U.S. national security.In short, FIRRMA will extend the agencyâ€™s oversight to cover more kinds of transactions including â€œinvestments where a foreign company would not necessarily gain control of a US firm [such as].joint ventures between US and foreign companies, minority stake investments and transactions near military bases or US government facilitiesâ€?.This bill was mainly driven by Washingtonâ€™s desire to prevent Chinese takeovers of American firms and access to US technology as evident by CFIUSâ€™ blocking of the acquisition of an American chipmaker Qualcomm by the Singapore-based Broadcom in March on a national security ground.However, nothing guarantees that acquisition cases in other industries will not fall under the mechanismâ€™s scrutiny in the future. In short, the entity can come to assess or even block other foreign investment coming from other countries into the US.Investment War Next?If Washington begins to block more inward foreign investment, other states may retaliate and the world will witness an investment war which could potentially damage the global economy to a great extent. Because capital is a necessary factor for the broadening and deepening of transnational production networks, this investment showdown will ultimately undermine or disrupt cross-border trade.In other words, investment must first take place to establish production facilities in several locations to then enable transnational supply chains to function. If capital flows are discouraged due to stricter rules and regulations, it would undermine production networks and trade between Washington and other countries around the world.Tariff drama aside, the US is having another tool in the pipeline which may in the future be wielded against its friends and foes alike. The world may have to brace itself again for another impact.*Kaewkamol Pitakdumrongkit is Deputy Head & Assistant Professor at the Centre for Multilateralism Studies (CMS), S.

"By RSISPresident Trumpâ€™s policies are undermining the post-World War II rules-based multilateral trading system. Countries in the European Union and Asia should resist,and speak up. They should also strengthen the G20.By Pradumna B. Rana(On 1 June, President Trump launched the opening salvo of a trade war by unilaterally imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imported into the country from the European Union (EU), Canada and Mexico. Canada has announced that it will â€œmove forward with retaliatory measures on July 1, applying equivalent tariffs to the ones that the Americans have unjustly applied to us.â€? The EU and Mexico have their guns loaded.The US and China, the two largest economies of the world, are also at the brink of a trade war. On 15 June, Trump announced tariffs on US $50 billion of Chinese goods and warned that any retaliation by Beijing would trigger another round of tariffs on Chinese goods. But China struck back within hours slapping the same amount of tariff on American imports, from agriculture and seafood to cars and energy products. The results of negotiations previously reached by the two parties are also invalid.Although hopefully the worst can still be avoided, the experience of the 1930s and the subsequent Great Depression suggests that trade wars can have serious economic and social consequences not only in the warring countries but the entire global economy. The IMF has warned that Trumpâ€™s controversial new import tariffs pose a stark threat to the global trading system and will ultimately damage the US economy.In addition to starting trade wars, Trumpâ€™s trade policies are undermining the post-World War II rules-based multilateral trading system established ironically by the US, as the hegemon, with the cooperation of other like-minded countries mainly in Europe. Under the auspices of the GATT and its successor the WTO (since 1995), globally tariffs had fallen to record low levels, volume of international trade had expanded manifold, and unprecedented economic prosperity had been achieved all over the world.Trumpâ€™s Threat to Withdraw from WTOSeventy years on, the Doha Round has stalled and some of the WTO rules and exceptions to the rules need to be revisited. But instead of reforming the institution Trump has threatened to withdraw the US from the WTO if it continues to rule against the country. The latter could happen if, for example, the WTO rules unfavorably on the recent metal tariffs which the US imposed on national security grounds so that they are consistent with a little-used WTO rule.Another way that the US is undermining the WTO is by refusing to appoint new judges to the WTO Appellate Body accusing it of bias against the US. When the next judgeâ€™s term expires in September the Appellate Body will not have the requisite three members to adjudicate disputes. The WTO has traditionally appointed judges based on consensus among its members. Perhaps it is time to change this method to save the rules-based system.From G7 to G6+1At the recent G7 summit, with a single tweet from Air Force One while flying to Singapore, Trump drove a deep wedge between the US and other G7 countries that traditionally consider themselves Washingtonâ€™s closest allies. These countries had cooperated closely with the US and helped it to build the post-World War II rules-based trading system. The summit was a fiasco. The future of the G7, which is supposed to be an oversight body for global matters including trade, is therefore uncertain. Contrary to what Trump had said at the recent Davos meeting that â€œAmerica First does not mean America Aloneâ€?, the G7 is now being described by many as G6+1 with the US being isolated.How should the rest of the world including Asia respond?Given that the rules-based multilateral trading system is under threat, countries in the European Union and in Asia (such as Japan, China, and India) should unite, resist, and speak up in favor of the WTO. They should also cooperate more closely in resolving issues, for example, on agriculture trade and in reforming the WTO. One reform proposal is that the WTO should address the 21st century trade issues which are â€œbehind the borderâ€? issues such as rules for investment protection, intellectual property and regulations on product standards and their harmonization. Global value chain or parts and components trade now comprise about 70 percent of global trade. Currently the WTO focuses on 20th century trade issues such as tariffs, quotas, and subsidies. It is the mega-free trade agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and, to a lesser extent, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) that are focusing on 21st century trade issues.G7 to G20?It is also time to start thinking of replacing the G7 with the G20. Of course, the G20 is not perfect and there is a need to enhance both its â€œinputâ€? legitimacy â€“ its exclusive nature and lack of broader representation â€“ and â€œoutputâ€? legitimacy â€“ its ability to strengthen international cooperation and come up with solutions. But it is the only forum where, in addition to the G7 countries, systemically important emerging markets have a representation and voice. The G7 members once ruled the world but now their share of world GDP is declining from about three-fourths in the 1990s to about one-half currently. The G7â€™s share of world population has also declined from about 20 percent to 15 percent during the same period, with aging populations in most countries. On the other hand, the G20 accounts for 85 percent of the worldâ€™s GDP and over 60 percent of its population and is more relevant. It could well save the global trading system from the depredation of the go-it-alone tendency of the US.*Pradumna B.

"By Michael Martina and David LawderBEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and China escalated their acrimonious trade war on Thursday, implementing punitive 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion (Â£12.4 billion) worth of each other's goods, even as mid-level officials from both sides resumed talks in Washington.The world's two largest economies have now slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on a combined $100 billion of products since early July, with more in the pipeline, adding to risks to global economic growth.giChina's Commerce Ministry said Washington was 'remaining obstinate' by implementing the latest tariffs, which kicked in on both sides as scheduled at 12:01 p.m. in Beijing (12:01 a.m. EDT/0401 GMT).'China resolutely opposes this, and will continue to take necessary countermeasures,' it said in a brief statement, adding that Beijing will file a complaint over the latest tariffs with the World Trade Organization.The tariffs, scheduled weeks ago, did not interfere with the start of a second day of trade talks in Washington led by Chinese Commerce Vice Minister Wang Shouwen and David Malpass, the U.S. Treasury under secretary for international affairs.Wang, asked by a Reuters reporter how the talks were progressing, declined to comment as he and his delegation entered the U.S. Treasury building on Thursday morning.President Donald Trump has threatened to put duties on almost all of the more than $500 billion of Chinese goods exported to the United States annually unless Beijing agrees to sweeping changes to its intellectual property practices, industrial subsidy programs and tariff structures, and buys more American goods.That figure would be far more than China imports from the United States, raising concerns that Beijing could consider other forms of retaliation, such as making life more difficult for American companies in China or allowing its yuan currency to weaken further to support its exporters.'WE HAVE MORE BULLETS'Trump administration officials have been divided over how hard to press Beijing, but the White House appears to believe it is winning the trade war as China's economy slows and its stock markets tumble.'They're not going to give that up easily. Naturally they'll retaliate a little bit,' U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on CNBC on Wednesday at a Century Aluminum Co smelter in Kentucky that has benefited from Trump's aluminium tariffs.'But at the end of the day, we have many more bullets than they do. They know it. We have a much stronger economy than they have, they know that too,' Ross said.Economists reckon that every $100 billion of imports hit by tariffs would reduce global trade by around 0.5 percent.They have assumed a direct impact on China's economic growth in 2018 of 0.1 to 0.3 percentage points, and somewhat less for the United States, but the impact will be bigger next year, along with collateral damage for other countries and companies tied into China's global supply chains.GRAPHIC - U.S. trade with China: https://tmsnrt.rs/2KAT34aHARD LINE RATTLES BEIJINGThe two days of talks in Washington were the first formal negotiations since Ross met with Chinese economic adviser Liu He in Beijing in June.Business groups expressed hope that the meeting would mark the start of serious negotiations over Chinese trade and economic policy changes demanded by Trump.However, Trump on Monday told Reuters in an interview that he did not 'anticipate much' from this week's talks.The U.S. president's hard line has rattled Beijing and spurred rare criticism within the highest levels of China's ruling Communist Party over its handling of the trade dispute, sources have said.Beijing has denied U.S. allegations that it systematically forces the unfair transfer of U.S. technology and has said that it adheres to World Trade Organization rules.Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang would not reveal any details of the talks during a daily news briefing.'We hope that the U.S. side can meet China halfway, and with a rational, pragmatic attitude, conscientiously with China get a good result,' Lu said.SEMICONDUCTORS, PLASTICS HITWashington's latest tariffs apply to 279 product categories, including semiconductors, plastics, chemicals and railway equipment, that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has said benefit from Beijing's 'Made in China 2025' industrial plan to make China competitive in high-tech industries.China's list of 333 U.S. product categories hit with duties includes coal, copper scrap, fuel, steel products, buses and medical equipment.Though it is too early for trade damage to show up in much economic data as yet, tariffs are beginning to increase costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Pacific, forcing companies to adjust their supply chains and pricing, with some U.S. companies looking to decrease their reliance on China.One executive at a major U.S. manufacturer in China told Reuters the uncertainty about the trade conflict's duration was more damaging than the tariffs themselves because it made business planning difficult.If the tariffs are in place for a long while, there will come a point at which the company would begin moving some sourcing and production out of China, a process that would be irreversible for several years once set in motion, the executive said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.(Reporting by David Lawder, Steve Holland and Tim Aeppel in Washington and Tony Munroe, Michael Martina, and Ben Blanchard in Beijing; Editing by Kim Coghill and Jonathan Oatis)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"If thereâ€™s a trade war between the U.S. and China, donâ€™t blame Donald Trump : China started it long before he became president.Even free traders and internationalists agree Chinaâ€™s predatory trade practicesâ€”which include forcing U.S. business to transfer valuable technology to Chinese firms and restricting access to Chinese marketsâ€”are undermining both its partners and the trading system.Mr. Trumpâ€™s China crackdown is risky, but itâ€™s on firmer legal, political and economic ground than many of his other trade complaints, for several reasons.1. These products are different: The classic case for free trade predicts that each country specializes where it has a comparative advantage, lowering costs and raising incomes for everyone. If China subsidizes exports of steel to the U.S., in theory the U.S. still benefits because consumers and steel-using industries will have lower costs, and while some steel jobs will disappear, more productive jobs elsewhere will take their place.But starting in the 1980s, economists recognized that comparative advantage couldnâ€™t explain success in many industries such as commercial jetliners, microprocessors and software. These industries are difficult for competitors to enter because of steep costs for research and development, previously established technical standards, increasing returns to scale (costs drop the more you sell), and network effects (the more customers use the product, the more valuable it becomes).In such industries, a handful of firms may reap the lionâ€™s share of the wages and profits (what economists call rents), at the expense of others. Chinaâ€™s efforts are aimed at achieving such dominance in many of these industries by 2025.â€œChina is undermining or taking away some of our rents, so we are relatively worse off and they are better off,â€? says Dartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin, author of â€œClashing over Commerce: A History of U.S. Trade Policy.â€? Unlike Mr. Trumpâ€™s tariffs on steel and aluminum, â€œa lot of economists would hold their fire in terms of attacking Trump for his China actions. I donâ€™t think anyone can really defend the way China has moved in the past few years, violating intellectual property and forced technology transfer.â€?2. The WTO isnâ€™t enough: When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, many advocates thought it would play by the global rules against advantaging its own firms and hurting others. Instead, China does so anyway in ways not easily remedied by the WTO.Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, notes that a WTO case typically requires evidence from an aggrieved company. But many foreign companies are reluctant to complain about their treatment in China for fear of retaliation, such as being investigated for antitrust, consumer abuse, fraud or espionage, or losing sales to state-controlled companies. With no balance of powers or independent courts, â€œthere is no rule of law to constrain Chinese officials from implementing arbitrary and capricious mercantilist policies,â€? Mr. Atkinson and two co-authors wrote in an extensive critique of China a year ago.It is also difficult to hold China accountable for its WTO obligations because its system is so opaque. Mr. Atkinson says many discriminatory measures arenâ€™t published, or published only in Chinese. When the central government, under external pressure, rescinds some discriminatory measures, they reappear at the provincial and local level, he says.3. The U.S. isnâ€™t alone: Mr. Trumpâ€™s steel and aluminum tariffs were widely panned for hitting both China and law-abiding allies like Canada and western Europe alike.By contrast, his ire at China is widely shared. French President Emmanuel Macron has called for a unified European Union policy against Chinese corporate takeovers.â€œEveryone who trades with China faces this problem,â€? Peter Navarro, Mr. Trumpâ€™s trade adviser, told reporters Thursday. â€œPart of the process that weâ€™ve undergone â€¦ is to have a significant outreach to our like-minded allies and trading partners.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"WASHINGTON (AP) -- If a trade war is coming, the cheesemakers of Wisconsin are standing in the line of fire. So are the farmers of the Great Plains and the distillers of Kentucky. And the employees of iconic American brands like Harley-Davidson and Levi Strauss.The likelihood of a trade conflagration leapt closer to reality this week after the United States imposed tariff on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Infuriated, the jilted U.S. allies vowed to retaliate with tariffs of their own. And in a separate dispute, China is poised to penalize $50 billion in U.S. goods -- many of them produced by supporters of President Donald Trump in the America's agricultural heartland.â€œThey're going to hit the farmers,' said Bryan Klabunde, a farmer in northwestern Minnesota. 'We want things fair for all industries, but we're going to take the brunt of the punishment if other countries retaliate.''President Donald Trump, who entered office promising to rip up trade deals and crack down on unfair trading practices, is clashing with trading partners on all sides. To the north, he's battling Canada; to the south, Mexico; to the east, Europe; across the Pacific Ocean to the west, China and Japan.'The president seems to be creating trade (and other) disputes with everyone -- allies and adversaries alike -- and it's difficult to discern any coherent strategy,' said Rod Hunter, a former National Security Council staffer under President George W. Bush. 'The impacts of the disputes have been limited so far, but the economic and political costs will go up as retaliation by trading partners begins in earnest.'Mexico, for instance, plans to retaliate against the steel and aluminum tariffs by targeting U.S. cheese, among other products.'It's our second-largest market,' Jeff Schwager, president of Sartori, a cheese company in Plymouth, Wisconsin, said of Mexico. Retaliatory tariffs 'will reduce sales -- there's no question.''The hard-earned sales we've secured in Mexico could be at risk given the potential for retaliation,' the National Milk Producers Federation warned in a statement.The EU is threatening to penalize Kentucky bourbon and the motorcycles of Wisconsin-based Harley-Davidson. The potential tariffs pack a political punch: They'd hurt constituents of House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican.On Friday, reporters in Louisville, Kentucky, asked McConnell if he thought the Europeans were trying to get his attention.'Well,' the Senate leader said, 'they got my attention. They didn't need to do that. These are our friends. These are not enemies. Canada and Mexico, Europe -- these are our allies, and we need to work this out in a way that's comforting to everyone.'Harley-Davidson has already absorbed higher steel and aluminum costs since Trump first announced the metals tariffs three months ago. Now, the threats of retaliatory tariffs from abroad raise the fear of higher prices for Harley motorcycles sold outside the U.S.In a statement, Harley-Davidson said retaliatory tariffs 'would have a significant impact on our sales' in those countries. The Milwaukee-based company said it was evaluating options for controlling higher materials costs. In April, its chief financial officer warned that cost increases could be worse than the company forecast in January and might last for several quarters.The jeans maker Levi Strauss is also on the EU's target list.'American brands, workers and consumers will ultimately suffer,' the San Francisco-based company said in a statement.Ben Steffen, a dairy farmer who also grows corn, soybeans, and wheat on 1,900 acres southeastern Nebraska near Humboldt, is angry about the U.S. tariffs being imposed on America's closest trade partners and allies.'I'm upset because it hits me in my pocketbook from multiple angles,' he said. 'I sell beef, I sell corn, I sell soybeans and I sell milk. All of those products are vulnerable because we export significant amounts in those markets.'The milk market has been depressed for about three years, and farmers have struggled to break even. About 14 percent of U.S. milk production is exported; the largest customer is Mexico.'This is the worst possible thing to have for our milk market, and it's the same for every other commodity,' Steffen said. ' These are important relationships.'In Stockton, California, Jeff Colombini is worried about the financial damage a trade war would bring to his 1,800-acre farm. His company, Lodi Farming, exports walnuts, cherries and apples to Mexico, Canada, the European Union and other countries.'With these tariffs, it's going to make the product too expensive for the consumers in Mexico and in Canada and in the EU,' Colombini said. 'We're not going to be able to sell all of our crop. And so some of it is probably going to go unharvested or just dumped ... I have 200 employees, and they depend on the success of this operation for their jobs to feed and clothe their families.'A trade fight with the Europe would also cause collateral damage across the Atlantic. Steelworkers in Port Talbot, Wales, who have struggled to protect their factory and 4,000 jobs, now face another threat.Union leader Mark Turner said workers are trying to sort out what the tariffs will mean for Port Talbot. But they feel 'everything is against us,' particularly given Britain's economic uncertainty as the country prepares to leave the European Union.'We will keep fighting,' Turner said. 'If we can't go into the American market, then there's other markets out there we will try and get into.An even higher-stakes trade dispute is playing out on the Pacific Rim. The United States and China are poised to impose tariffs on up to $200 billion worth of each other's goods in a battle over Beijing's strong-arm efforts to overtake U.S. technological supremacy.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is traveling to Beijing this weekend for talks aimed at preventing an all-out trade war between the world's two biggest economies. On the Chinese target list are American soybean farmers, who send about 60 percent of their exports to China.On Friday, Klabunde, who grows corn and soybeans on 3,000 acres near Waubun, Minnesota, spent two nerve-wracking hours with a hired hand, pulling a stuck tractor out of a drainage ditch. They finally got the machine free.'I think the tariffs and trade war scare me more than a stuck planter,' Klabunde said. 'I can lose only so much money on a stuck planter. I can lose a lot more money in a trade war.'------Karnowski reported from Minneapolis------AP staffers Terry Chea in Stockton, California; Carrie Antlfinger in Plymouth, Wisconsin; Bruce Schreiner in Louisville, Kentucky; David Pitt in Des Moines, Iowa; Anne D'Innocenzio and Candice Choi in New York; David Koenig in Dallas; and Danica Kirka in London contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trumpâ€™s closest economic advisers are scrambling to get in his ear after the commander in chief announced plans to implement tariffs on steel and aluminum products, FOX Business has learned.Continue Reading BelowSteve Moore and Larry Kudlow, external advisers to the president, have been reaching out to senior White House officials since Thursdayâ€™s announcement in efforts to temper the presidentâ€™s path towards a potential trade war with nations that are allies of the United States.â€œWe'd like to try to get in to see him and try to talk him out of this or at least ramp it down. Whether itâ€™s going to happen or not is unclear. Whether he's already totally bogged down, I'm not sure,â€? Moore, a distinguished visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told FOX Business on Friday.Kudlow, a conservative economist, confirmed to FOX Business theyâ€™re trying to get in the White House to dissuade the president, but admitted the chances of success are slim.â€œIâ€™m quite certain the steel deal is done,â€? Kudlow said. When asked if he thought they had a chance to convince the president to reverse track on the likely tariffs on aluminum goods, Kudlow simply replied, â€œno.â€?AdvertisementBoth Kudlow and Moore are known as supply-side economists, a group that believes natural economic growth comes from cutting taxes and limiting business regulations. They were also key advisers of the recently passed Republican tax bill which, amongst other things, cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and nearly doubled the standard deduction.On Thursday Trump, with a host of steel and aluminum executives by his side, made the bold announcement that he will be imposing import tariffs of 25% on steel products and 10% on aluminum. His argument was that countries have been taking advantage of the U.S. for decades with tariffs of their own and this was his chance to make a change to those past policies. On Friday he doubled down on his decision via a tweet saying â€œtrade wars are good and easy to win.â€?However, the presidentâ€™s seemingly last minute decision has left him isolated, at least for now, from allies abroad, within the White House, on Capitol Hill and Wall Street, including National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, who, according to Moore, is likely not pleased with the move. â€œI do know he's (Cohn) a free trade guy and he's probably not really thrilled with the latest developments,â€? Moore said. He added though, that heâ€™s unsure if the disagreement with the announcement will be enough to force Cohn to resign. â€œIt's possible he may leave at some point but I donâ€™t think it will be anytime soon as he's an important voice for economic sanity within the administration,â€? Moore said.Allies expressing outrage include Canada, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday calling the tariffs on steel and aluminum products â€œabsolutely unacceptableâ€? while noting his government will continue to engage with U.S. officials on the issue. Trudeauâ€™s criticism comes as the European Union is reportedly considering applying 25% tariffs on around $3.5 billion worth of U.S. imports, if the administration moves ahead with restrictions of their own. The president has yet to explain which nations will receive the brunt of their new trade policies.Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) led the charge from Capitol Hill against Trump, going as far to say â€œYou'd expect a policy this bad from a leftist administration, not a supposedly Republican one,â€? in a statement on Thursday.Americaâ€™s most powerful CEOs took on the administration as well. The Business Roundtable, chaired by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and whose member companies bring in over $8 trillion in annual revenues, denounced the White House announcement in statement of their own.â€œBusiness Roundtable strongly disagrees with todayâ€™s announcement because it will hurt the U.S. economy and American companies, workers and consumers by raising prices and resulting in foreign retaliation against U.S. exporters,â€? Joshua Bolten, Business Roundtableâ€™s president said in a statement.A White House spokeswoman did not return requests for comment at the time of publication. However, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told FOX Business' Stuart Varney that consumers had nothing to fear.â€œI just bought a can of Campbellâ€™s soup today at the Seven Eleven. It was $1.99 for the can' Ross said. 'Thereâ€™s about 10 cents worth of tin plate steel in this can. So if it goes up 25%, thatâ€™s a tiny fraction of one penny. Thatâ€™s not a noticeable thing,' he added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Count Apple's Tim Cook among those who don't think a trade war between the U.S. and China is likely to occur.Speaking to analysts on Tuesday after the company announced fiscal second-quarter results, Cook, who recently met with President Donald Trump concerning trade, said he is 'very optimistic' the two countries can work out their differences.'I think my own view is that China and the U.S. have this unavoidable mutuality where China only wins if the U.S. wins and the U.S. only wins if China wins and the world only wins if China and the U.S. win,' Cook said when asked if the threat of a trade war between the world's two largest economies could impact the company's business. 'And so I think there's lots of things that bind the countries together and I'm actually very optimistic.'APPLE'S SIRI IN THE SPOTLIGHT FOR POTTY MOUTHCook, 57, added history has shown that 'countries that embrace openness and diversity do much, much better than the ones that are closed.'He ended his response by saying: 'I'm a big believer that the two countries together can both win and grow the pie, not just allocate it differently. And so that's our focus, and I'm optimistic that â€“ I don't know every play by play that will happen, but over time, I think that view will prevail.'Apple, the world's largest company by market cap, has a significant interest in the outcome of any trade talks between the U.S. and China.In its most recent quarter, Apple generated $13 billion in revenue from Greater China, up 21 percent year-over-year, the strongest growth rate Apple has seen there in two-and-a-half years. Later on in the conference call, Cook said the growth in China was aided by the iPhone X, Apple's $999 smartphone and its wearable business.Apple's second-quarter surpassed Wall Street's expectations, Fox Business reported. Revenue rose 16 percent year-over-year to $61.1 billion, compared to $60.82 billion expected by analysts.Apple shares were up more than 4 percent to $176.12 in early Wednesday trading.NEW, CHEAPER IPHONE COMING, REPORTS SAYWhile Apple gets a lot of revenue from China, its relationship with the world's largest country by population goes even further than that. Apple uses Foxconn Technology, the largest private employer in China, to assemble many of its products, including the iPhone. In the past, both Apple and Foxconn have come under intense criticism for labor practices in the country, but Apple has worked with its partners to improve these practices.The company recently outlined the progress it has made and the challenges that lie ahead in its 2018 progress report.Cook's comments come as the U.S. is sending representatives to China to discuss trade relations between the two countries. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow are among the officials set to head to Beijing tomorrow to discuss trade.Speaking to Fox Business, Secy. Mnuchin said he was 'cautiously optimistic' about the meetings.IN TIME FOR EARTH DAY, APPLE UNVEILS 'DAISY,' ITS SECOND IPHONE-DISASSEMBLING ROBOTThe venerable Apple CEO recently met with Trump to discuss trade, according to a tweet from the president.'Looking forward to my meeting with Tim Cook of Apple,' Trump tweeted on April 25. 'We will be talking about many things, including how the U.S. has been treated unfairly for many years, by many countries, on trade.'Cook, along with Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, attended last month's State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to Washington.Fox Business' Thomas Barrabi contributed to this report.

"iPhones have become a political pawn in a brewing trade war between the US and Turkey. On Tuesday, Turkey's President called for a boycott of US electronics and named the iPhone as one product local residents should shun.'We will impose a boycott on US electronic products,' Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a televised speech. 'If they have iPhones, there is Samsung on the other side.'Erdogan made the comments in retaliation against US sanctions, which have helped worsen an economic crisis in the country. The Trump administration has been demanding that Turkish authorities free an American pastor who was arrested back in 2016 over charges he tried to overthrow Erdogan's government.To force Turkey into releasing the pastor, the Trump administration began doubling tariffs on imported Turkish steel and aluminum last week. The country's local currency, the lira, has since plummeted in value.In response to the sanctions, Erdogan has been urging local citizens to trade their US currency for the lira, and to buy domestically-produced goods. In Monday's speech, he also reportedly told the populace to consider buying products from Vestel, a Turkish maker of Android handsets.Despite the harsh talk against Apple, The New York Times reports that Erdogan and his officials are frequently seen with iPhones in their hands. Two years ago, Erdogan even addressed the Turkish public using Apple's FaceTime following a coup attempt.In terms of smartphone sales, Turkey isn't a major market for the iPhone. According to the research firm Canalys, the company shipped a mere 450,000 iPhones to Turkey in this year's second quarter â€” a period when Apple shipped 41 million iPhones worldwide.'My take is this: President Erdogan is making more of a political move than an economic move,' Canalys analyst Ben Stanton told PCMag. 'His rhetoric reflects a desire to support Turkish electronics businesses like Vestel. But in reality, Apple is not a threat to Vestel.'Stanton pointed to the growing presence of Chinese smartphones in the Turkish market. 'If President Erdogan truly wants to support Turkish electronics, he must look to China as the primary threat. Companies like Huawei, for example, which increased its smartphone shipments in Turkey by over 200 percent in the last year,' he added.Nevertheless, Apple ranks as the second largest smartphone vendor in the country with a 13 percent share, according to Canalys. Meanwhile, Samsung holds the top spot with a 38 percent share.This article originally appeared on PCMag.com.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"GENEVA (AFP) -The head of the World Trade Organization warned senior diplomats Monday against tipping 'the first dominoes' in a trade war that would be hard to reverse and trigger a deep recession.The stark alert from WTO director-general Roberto Azevedo came days after President Donald Trump's announcement last week that Washington was set to impose heavy tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the US.US trading partners, including China and the European Union, already are preparing to retaliate and have pledged to file a dispute at the 164-member WTO.'In light of recent announcements on trade policy measures, it is clear that we now see a much higher and real risk of triggering an escalation of trade barriers across the globe', WTO director-general Roberto Azevedo told a heads of delegation meeting at the organisation's Geneva headquarters.'We cannot ignore this risk and I urge all parties to consider and reflect on this situation very carefully.'Once we start down this path it will be very difficult to reverse direction. An eye for an eye will leave us all blind and the world in deep recession', he said.'We must make every effort to avoid the fall of the first dominoes', Azevedo continued, adding that 'there is still time'.Azevedo, a former Brazilian trade envoy, on Friday said that he was 'clearly concerned' about Trump's promised new tariffs -- 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium.Trump said Monday on Twitter that he would only scrap planned tariffs on aluminium and steel if a 'new & fair' deal to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement is reached.Â© 2018 AFP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BUENOS AIRES (AFP) -The United States is not seeking a trade war over tariffs but does not fear one, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday after a meeting of G20 finance ministers.A trade war 'is not our goal, but we are not afraid of it,' Mnuchin said at the end of the two-day meeting in Buenos Aires aimed at averting a crisis sparked by looming US tariffs on steel and aluminum.'We have to be prepared to act in the US interest to defend free and fair reciprocal trade. In doing that there is always a risk.'That's not our goal. But we are not afraid of it,' he said.Mnuchin was speaking after ministers agreed not to condemn the US move in the meeting's final statement, but instead spoke of 'heightened economic and geopolitical tensions.''Downside risks persist and, over the medium term, challenges remain to raise growth and make it more inclusive,' the ministers from the most developed and emerging economies said.The final communique, approved three days before US trade tariffs on steel and aluminum come into force, comes as the world's two biggest economies -- the US and China -- engage in a clash over trade rules, particularly overproduction, in which European and other US allies could sustain collateral damage.'We sensed a willingness of the Americans to reduce tensions,' French ministry sources said after a meeting on Monday between France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and Mnuchin.Le Maire was among several EU ministers to plead for an exemption from the US tariffs, saying the problem was due to China's overcapacity, not key allies in Europe.Mnuchin's veiled threat was echoed by EU Economic and Financial Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, with a statement carrying the same hint of steel in a velvet-gloved hand.'The EU does not want an escalation on trade, it does not want a trade war, but it is ready to react, even if our preferred option is dialogue,' he said. 'Our countermeasures are ready.'-- Working on consensus over tech --Ministers agreed to delay the search for a solution on touchy subject of taxing the four American tech giants, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.In their statement, the ministers pledged to 'work together to seek a consensus-based solution by 2020,' on the taxation of digital giants. They agreed to provide an update on the situation in 2019.'This is a positive message: there was no shock at the meeting,' Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the Center for Tax Policy and Administration at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.On the eve of the meeting, Mnuchin had sounded a clear warning that the US 'firmly opposes' any new tax aimed at its big tech firms, despite a growing EU resolve to tackle the issue.Muscovici is to present the EU Commission's proposals in Brussels on Wednesday. He had sought to reassure his US counterparts in Buenos Aires on Monday, underlining that the EU measures 'are a response to a situation, and are not anti-American measures.'G20 ministers sounded a caution on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, agreeing that they 'lack the key attributes of sovereign currencies' and pointing out that 'at some point, they could have financial stability implications.'Mnuchin, speaking on Venezuela, who introduced its own cryptocurrency to counter US sanctions, said the US would consider additional sanctions against President Nicolas Maduro's socialist government.'I can assure you that we will continue to evaluate the situation there and consider additional sanctions,' he said.Â© 2018 AFP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SAINT PETERSBURG (AFP) -Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Friday that the world could be heading for an unprecedented economic crisis due to the confrontational trade policy and protectionism being pursued by the United States.Without directly naming US President Donald Trump, who has slapped on tariffs and pulled out of trade deals, Putin lamented that a new era of protectionism was emerging and 'breaking' the free trade system responsible for global prosperity.'Today we need not trade wars or even trade truces, but trade peace,' Putin told an economic summit in Saint Petersburg, also attended by Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and French President Emmanuel Macron.Global trade rules 'should be clear and the same for all'.But 'breaking the rules is becoming the rule,' Putin said in an apparent jab at Trump, who has abandoned a Pacific free trade deal and forced a renegotiation of the US pact with Canada and Mexico.The Kremlin leader said that a combination of sanctions, trade barriers and a lack of trust was hugely dangerous.'A spiral of sanctions and barriers is just beginning and is affecting a growing number of countries and companies,' said Putin.The trade barriers and the mistrust they generate 'could lead to a systemic crisis the likes of which the world has not seen before,' he said.Â© 2018 AFP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LAUNCESTON: Prices for spot cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in top-consuming region Asia have become more volatile amid a northern hemisphere heat wave, Chinaâ€™s switch to cleaner fuels and a side-helping of Donald Trump-inspired trade disruptions.The spot LNG price <LNG-AS> for September delivery in North Asia rose to US$9.75 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in the week to July 27, the first increase in six weeks.Soaring temperatures in Japan and South Korea were behind the move higher, as utilities ramped up electricity output to meet the demand for air-conditioning. Japan even resorted to restarting old and dirty oil-fired power plants, in addition to boosting natural gas generation.The boost to prices last week was the latest turn in a spot LNG market that has become more volatile and sensitive to even relatively modest moves in supply and demand.The spot price reached US$11.60 per mmBtu in mid-June, an unusual occurrence as it meant the peak summer price exceeded that for the previous winter for the first time since 2012.LNG has a seasonal pattern, with the peak price usually occurring in the northern winter, followed by a lower high in summer and troughs in autumn and spring.The mid-June price peak was built on strong demand from China, the worldâ€™s No. 2 importer, whose rapid growth took it past South Korea last year, although it still has some way to go to dislodge Japan from the top spot.Some supply outages at the same time in major producer Australia, as well as Malaysia and the United States, also drove prices higher in June.While the spot price has shifted up a gear, the extra demand has yet to show up in trade flows.Northeast Asia, which includes the three top LNG buyers of Japan, China, and South Korea, is on track to import around 14.2 million tonnes of LNG in July, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters.This would be largely steady to Juneâ€™s 14.8 million tonnes and 14.5 million tonnes in July last year.Japan driving demandLooking at the breakdown by country shows Japan on track to import about 6.4 million tonnes in July, up from Juneâ€™s 6.03 million, but below last Julyâ€™s 7.1 million.China will import around 3.85 million tonnes in July, down a tad from Juneâ€™s 3.95 million, but up from 2.91 million in July of 2017.South Koreaâ€™s July imports are headed for 2.5 million tonnes, a 26 percent slump from Juneâ€™s 3.4 million and also well below the 3 million from July a year ago.While China is still posting large year-on-year gains, it seems current demand for LNG is largely being driven by Japan.The dynamics of LNG flows are also shifting, partly as a result of US President Donald Trumpâ€™s escalating trade dispute with China.While trade in LNG isnâ€™t restricted in any way as yet, it seems China is quietly discouraging its major oil and gas companies from buying from the United States.Only two cargoes arrive in China in July from the United States, carrying just 0.13 million tonnes of the super-chilled fuel.This was an unchanged number of cargoes from June, but down on five vessels that arrived in May, and well below seven that unloaded in January this year.The winner in China is Australia, with imports totalling to 12.4 million tonnes in the first seven months of the year, up from 9.1 million tonnes in the same period last year.Australia has also upped its shipments to Japan, with 15.9 million tonnes arriving in the first seven months, up from 14.6 million in the same period in 2017.US LNG suppliers have had some success in shipping to Asian countries other than China, with Japan taking three cargoes in July, down from four in June and level with May.South Korea brought in four US cargoes in July, the same number as June and down from five in May.But with Chinese demand for US LNG under a cloud, itâ€™s likely that US producers will have to offer more competitive prices to other buyers in Asia, or perhaps in Europe.This may prompt changes in the way LNG producers such as Qatar and Australia market spot cargoes, increasing volatility in a market that has shifted from being fairly predictable to one characterized by quicker and larger price swings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BRUSSELS: The European Union slapped revenge tariffs on iconic US products including bourbon, jeans and motorcycles on Friday in its opening salvo in a trade war with President Donald Trump.The tariffs, which took effect at midnight (2200 GMT Thursday) according to the EUâ€™s official journal, will further fuel jitters on world stock markets that are already alarmed by trade tensions between the United States and China.Customs agents across the Europeâ€™s colossal market of 500 million people will now impose the duty, hiking prices on US-made products in supermarkets and across factory floors.Brussels imposed the raft of duties on US products worth 2.8 billion euros (RM13.2 billion) in a tit-for-tat response to Trumpâ€™s decision to slap stiff tariffs on European steel and aluminium exports.EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said this week that the 28-nation bloc was â€œleft with no other choiceâ€? but to impose tariffs of its own after the â€œunilateral and unjustified decision of the US.â€?Together with US tariffs against Mexico and Canada, the trade battles have raised the spectre of a global trade war, spooking financial markets that fear major consequences to the global economy.â€œWe have a trade war â€” and itâ€™s an escalating trade war,â€? SEB chief economist Robert Bergqvist told AFP in an interview.Brussels first drew up the list in March when Trump initially floated the 25% tariffs on steel imports and 10% on aluminium, which also target Canada, Mexico and other close allies.The list does not specifically name brands but European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker spelt out in March that the bloc would target â€œHarley-Davidson, bourbon and Leviâ€™s jeansâ€?.Cranberries, cranberry juice, orange juice, sweetcorn and peanut butter are among the other food products targeted.The list also hits clothing along with bed linen and menâ€™s leather footwear, eye make-up and lipsticks, plus a host of steel products.â€˜Against all logicâ€™Juncker said on Thursday that the US decision to impose tariffs â€œgoes against all logic and historyâ€?.â€œOur response must be clear but measured. We will do what we have to do to rebalance and safeguard,â€? he said.European consumers would be able to find â€œalternativesâ€?, European Commission Vice President for trade Jyrki Katainen said.â€œIf we chose products like Harley Davidson, peanut butter and bourbon, itâ€™s because there are alternatives on the market. We donâ€™t want to do anything that would harm consumers,â€? he said on Thursday.â€œWhatâ€™s more, these products will have a strong symbolic political impact.â€?Analyst Bergqvist argued that his â€œmain concernâ€? over a trade war was the impact on stock markets â€” and the subsequent knock-on effect for the world economy.â€œAll these kind of things going on right now could trigger that kind of behaviour and initiate a correction in the stock markets, and that could also trigger a slowdown in the global economy,â€? he said.Relations reach new lowsTransatlantic ties are at their lowest level for many years due to rows over a host of issues including the tariffs, the Paris climate agreement, the Iran nuclear deal and the new US embassy in Jerusalem.Relations plumbed new depths at the recent G7 summit when Trump abruptly rejected the joint statement and bitterly insulted his Canadian host, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Trump claimed America had been obliged to levy the metals tariffs as it has been exploited as the worldâ€™s â€œpiggy bankâ€?. He is also targeting EU auto imports with a US probe now underway.Trumpâ€™s outbursts were the latest in which he has clashed with Americaâ€™s closest allies, even as he has had warm words for autocrats like North Korean leader Kim Jong un, with whom he had a historic meeting last week, and Russiaâ€™s Vladimir Putin.But US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs Wess Mitchell said on Thursday that Trumpâ€™s approach towards his allies was about â€œstrategic renovationâ€?.â€œStrengthening the West means making hard decisions today when we initially disagree, rather than continuing to accept the appearance of transatlantic unity for the sake of avoiding disagreement,â€? he told the Carnegie Europe think-tank in Brussels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SINGAPORE: Asian countries have voiced concern about the potentially devastating impact of a US-China trade war, with ministers calling for the acceleration of talks for a gigantic Beijing-backed free-trade deal that excludes the United States.Fear that a simmering trade spat between the worldâ€™s top two economies could spiral into a full-blown trade war â€” with painful consequences for Chinaâ€™s neighbours â€” was among topics dominating discussion at a regional summit in Singapore on Saturday.Tit-for-tat tariffs have fuelled months of tensions that were notched up Friday as Beijing threatened to impose levies on US$60 billion of American goods, from beef to condoms.The measures, which the White House ridiculed as â€œweakâ€? but China said were â€œfully justifiedâ€?, came after Washington said it would increase the rate of additional tariffs on Chinese goods worth US$200 billion.The prospect of a trade war is a â€œreal threatâ€? to Asian countries, Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah told reporters Saturday on the sidelines of the summit.â€œThe threat is making many countries very concerned andâ€¦ is becoming more complex,â€? he said.Other top Asian diplomats at Saturdayâ€™s forum, hosted by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), spoke out against protectionism, warning that it places the regionâ€™s development in jeopardy.â€œRising anti-globalisation and trade protectionism among major countries is fuelling tensions and threatening our aspirations for sustained economic growth,â€? said South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha.Countries in the region must â€œexplore creative ways to further deepen and broaden our cooperationâ€?, in the face of such challenges, she said.Some ministers have called for the early conclusion of talks for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a 16-nation pact poised to become the worldâ€™s largest free-trade agreement, covering about half the global population.The planned RCEP deal would group the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean plus China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.â€˜Protectionism on the riseâ€™But it would not include the United States, which had been leading another regional trade pact â€” the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) â€” until US President Donald Trump abruptly abandoned it last year.Even with the lure to access to the worldâ€™s largest economy withdrawn, the eleven remaining TPP countries, who make up 13.5% of the global economy, signed a slimmed-down version of the pact in March.It cuts tariffs and requires members to comply with a high level of regulatory standards in areas like labour law and environmental protection.RCEP also aims to cut tariffs but has far less regulatory standards attached than TPP.Nonetheless, Washingtonâ€™s abandonment of TPP has given the RCEP negotiations a fresh shot in the arm.â€œGiven the current global situation where protectionism is on the rise, Japan would like to achieve a swift conclusion of our RCEP negotiations,â€? Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said.Singaporeâ€™s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said he hoped the RCEP pact would be complete by the end of the year, while Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan urged countries facing â€œheadwinds against free tradeâ€? to rally together.The US imposed 25% tariffs on US$34 billion of Chinese goods in early July, sparking retaliatory measures from China.Days later, Washington unveiled a list of another US$200 billion in Chinese goods from electrical machinery to seafood that would be hit with 10% import duties.Trump upped the ante this week by threatening to lift the tariff rate to 25%.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the US position and hit back at China.â€œPresident Trump inherited an unfair trade regime where American workers and American companies were not treated reciprocally by the Chinese,â€? he said Saturday.â€œEfforts of the Trump administration are to right that, to correct it, to adjust that.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Washington DC [USA]: United States President Donald Trump on Thursday imposed massive trade tariffs amounting to USD 60 billion on China, in a move that could escalate into a global trade war, given the accelerating trade tensions between the two countries.Terming Beijing as its efforts to steal â€˜intellectual propertyâ€™ from American companies, President Trump signed a memorandum directing the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) and the US Treasury Department to launch a â€˜broad range of actionsâ€™ against China. During an event at the White House, Trump said that imposing tariffs on China is â€œgoing to make the US a much stronger and a much richer nation.â€? The US President called China as a â€œfriendâ€? but demanded that Beijing should adopt more favourable trade practices with Washington D.C.â€œThatâ€™s how China rebuilt itself. The tremendous money that weâ€™ve paid since the founding of the World Trade Organization, which has actually been a disaster for us. Itâ€™s been very unfair to us. The arbitrations are very unfair. The judging has been very unfair. And knowingly, we always have a minority, and itâ€™s not fair,â€? President Trump said.The US President alleged that China had been indulging in tremendous intellectual property theft worth hundreds of billions of dollars on a yearly basis.â€œIâ€™ve spoken to the (Chinese) president. Iâ€™ve spoken to representatives of China. Weâ€™ve been dealing with it very seriously. As you know, weâ€™re renegotiating NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement). Weâ€™ll see how that turns out. Many countries are calling to negotiate better trade deals because they donâ€™t want to have to pay the steel and aluminium tariffs, and we are negotiating with various countries,â€? he added.President Trump will soon consult US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider whether the actions by China should result in increased tariffs on their imports. The USTR is expected to publish a proposed list of products and recommended tariff increases for public comment within the next 15 days, according to The Hill. The White House said that the Trump administration will propose adding 25 percent additional tariffs on certain products including aerospace, information communication technology and machinery for public comment.The decision comes after President Trump said earlier this month that the US will impose new tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium separately. While the steel and aluminium tariffs were targeted toward China, the new measures are even more focused on Beijing and could draw more political support from Congress. The steel and aluminium tariffs have been criticized by many Democratic and Republican lawmakers as well. The new order will see a 25 percent tariff on imports of steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminium. This might potentially have huge implications on the international trade front, with many experts predicting it will adversely affect oil prices, as well as prompting fears of a trade war. President Trump has also asked the USTR to pursue dispute settlement through the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to address Chinaâ€™s â€˜discriminatory licensing practicesâ€™.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Trade wars may not have winners but they certainly have losers.The escalating trade war between China and the US is doing significant economic damage on both sides of the Pacific.Washington recently imposed a 25% tariff on $16 billion of Chinese imports, bringing the total amount of targeted Chinese imports to $50 billion and the number of categories of effected product categories to 279. China has responded in kind with $16 billion in tariffs of its own on US goods.Now, US President Donald Trump is threatening to slap tariffs on an additional $200 billion of imports.A chronology of the tit-for-tat over tariffs can be found here. Below we look at the sectors and companies that are paying the price for the intensifying US-China trade war:AutomotiveThe automotive sector was among the first industries hit. Three of the largest US carmakers saw their share values plummet after warning that trade war fears hurt their performance.Mary Barra, CEO of General MotorsFord and General Motors lowered profit forecasts for 2018 due to higher steel and aluminum prices. A slump in sales in China, thanks to postponed purchases, also caused Fiat Chrysler to cut its revenue outlook for the year.TechnologyAn atmosphere of paranoia (now inflamed by recent trade tensions) has seen several M&A deals torpedoed. The most high-profile among them was Singapore-based chipmaker Broadcomâ€™s hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm. The Trump administration blocked this. This move was likely fueled by fears that the deal would give China the lead in a race to develop 5G mobile internet technology. National-security issues have become an important dimension of deteriorating US-China economic ties.Earlier this year, directors from intelligence agencies like the CIA, FBI and NSA expressed distrust of mobile Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE. Huawei tried to enter the US market via a partnership with AT&T but was dropped by its American partner in January.It now appears that Apple will be the next to suffer. Apple probably won't face more duties on iPhone imports from China, but part of its market is still in China. Peopleâ€™s Daily, a state-run newspaper, has already suggested the company could be a â€œbargaining chipâ€?.Agricultureâ€œThe pain for US farmers will be acute because China will shift its purchases to places like Brazil, Argentina, Australia. Prices for US agriculture, like soybean, will fall, sometimes sharply,â€? says Gary Hufbauer, an economist and nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.A 229-metre bulk carrier called the Peak Pegasus, owned by JP Morgan Asset Management, has been the most high-profile victim thus far. The ship left Seattle on June 8 with a $20 million shipment of soybeans and was due to dock in the Chinese port of Dalian on July 6. Unfortunately, Chinese retaliatory tariffs kicked in by then. The ship was left to idle in Chinese waters for weeks, at a steep cost to the cargoâ€™s owners: Amsterdam-based trading house, Louis Dreyfus.Meanwhile, the largest US-based meat producer, Tyson Foods, is also hurting. The company blames Chinaâ€™s retaliatory tariffs on US pork for falling profits. In a statement, president and CEO Tom Hayes says: 'The combination of changing global trade policies here and abroad, and the uncertainty of any resolution, have created a challenging market environment of increased volatility, lower prices and oversupply of protein.'Consumer Goods and RetailSouth Carolina consumer electronics firm, Element Electronics, says it will close its plant in October. The move will cost 126 jobs. The company blames the cut-back on tariffs on imports of Chinese TV components.â€œOn the US import side, business purchasers of industrial inputs will have to pay higher prices in the short run before they can locate alternative suppliers, either domestic or foreign,' says Hufbauer. â€œConsumers will pay more for a variety of products in places like Walmart and Target.â€?Walmart is particularly exposed. The company is America's largest importer, and reliant on trade relations with the rest of the world, particularly in China. According to 2016 figures from the Alliance for American Manufacturing, 80% of Walmartâ€™s suppliers are in China.Hufbauer notes that both US and Chinese companies face long-term damage from the disruption of normal trade relations. The only sectors likely to escape unscathed are industries like tourism, Hollywood and banking.â€œChina is more vulnerable from an economic standpoint, but the US is more vulnerable from a political standpoint. The reason is that the US has a free press which will uncover all the individual instances of pain,â€? he adds. â€œOf course, China does not have a free press, so economic misery will be concealed.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Accra, July 3, (UPI/GNA) - Farmers across the Midwestern United States expect to lose billions of dollars this year if the trade war between the United States and China continues to escalate. China has threatened $50 billion in tariffs on American exports - including soybeans and other agricultural products - beginning Friday. The move is retaliation for tariffs the United States imposed on ChiAccra, July 3, (UPI/GNA) - Farmers across the Midwestern United States expect to lose billions of dollars this year if the trade war between the United States and China continues to escalate.China has threatened $50 billion in tariffs on American exports - including soybeans and other agricultural products - beginning Friday.The move is retaliation for tariffs the United States imposed on China to combat 'unfair practices related to the acquisition of American intellectual property and technology,' President Donald Trump said.Rather than spur China to alter its trade policies, China punched back, putting the two governments in a standoff. Midwestern farmers are in the crossfire.'There are issues related to our trade dealings with China,' said Grant Kimberley, the Director of market development for the Iowa Soybean Association. 'Trump's not wrong. But the stakes are pretty high here. We don't want to be the pawn.'The stakes are high because China buys roughly 30 percent of all America's soy. The proposed 25 percent tariff -- which is a tax buyers pay the government to purchase the commodity -- ensures Chinese buyers will look elsewhere.A Purdue University study estimated soy exports to China would drop about 65 percent under such a tariff.'That is a major disaster,' said Farzad Taheripour, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue.If the trade dispute remains unresolved by fall harvest time, the price of American soy will fall sharply, said Taheripour, who conducted the study. Farmers could lose more than $3 billion in the first year.An Iowa State University economist said that Iowa farmers alone could lose up to $624 million. What that looks will like on individual farms is hard to predict.'I think I can weather this,' said John Heisdorffer, an Iowa farmer. 'I think I can. Farmers are used to markets going up and down, and we try and prepare for the down years. But there is no way to prepare for this. We're going to lose money on every acre of soybeans.'Heisdorffer, who is the president of the American Soybean Association, worries for young farmers with less money put aside. He also fears that farmers who rent land will not earn enough to pay their leases.'There will be farmers who lose their rentals,' he said.Farmers who stay afloat will do what they can to prepare for a lean year. Most will put off buying new farm equipment and tractors, said Jim Fitkin, an Iowa farmer. Many will probably buy less fertilizer.'There's not much more we can put off,' Fitkin said.That leaves them in the uncomfortable position of waiting and hoping for a swift resolution between the feuding governments. And they're not the only ones. The soy tariff will have equally profound impacts on the Chinese economy.Taheripour's study predicts that the Chinese economy lose more than $3 billion due to the tariff. That's on top of the billions of dollars more that the United States' tariffs will cost them.'We have good relationships with industry buyers in China,' Kimberley said. 'They also want this resolved quickly. They want to buy from us. We just need our governments to figure out a way to resolve this.'If a swift resolution is not achieved, America's agricultural economy will experience some fast -- and painful -- adjustments over the next few years.With less demand, American soy production will likely drop 15 percent, Taheripour said. Farmers who stay solvent will have to find other crops to grow.Meanwhile, soy production elsewhere in the world will skyrocket to fill China's demand, Taheripour said.Brazil, which competes with the United States in soy exports, will see a huge economic stimulus.'Brazilian farmers will do well with this,' Taheripour said.With the extra money, Brazil is planning to build roads and invest in other infrastructure in rural areas, Taheripour said. The new infrastructure will allow that country to not only increase their soy exports, but other crops as well.'That's going to have lots of unforeseen impacts in the future,' Taheripour said. 'This trade war is a big gift for Brazil.'American farmers and trade negotiators are hopeful it won't come to that.'We just have to hope that this is dealt with quickly so we can get back to the business of feeding the world,' Kimberley said. 'Ultimately, nobody is going to win in a trade war that affects food.'GNA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The brewing trade war comes as U.S. farm income was already forecast to drop to a 12-year low and threatens one of the few sectors of the American economy with a net trade surplus. Agricultural groups have blasted the Trump administration's hard-line stance, with the American Soybean Association saying that growers will face 'devastating' effects. Exports are at risk at a time when growers are already facing stiff competition from Brazil and battling crop surpluses.'As agriculture continues to be the pawn in these trade wars, it makes the prices we receive at the farmgate much more volatile and uncertain,' said Justin Knopf, a farmer in Saline County, Kansas. He grows wheat, corn, soy, sorghum and alfalfa on about 4,000 acres with his dad and brother.'I know the president keeps saying we'll get a great deal,' Knopf said. 'In the meantime, it's really discouraging to have our commodity prices and our family's revenue be impacted so much because of what's happening on trade.'China's proposed duties could be felt strongest in the U.S. heartland, where Midwest voters helped secure Trump's election victory. The escalating trade spat threatens to weaken some of that support. The top producers of soybeans include political battleground states like Ohio and Iowa.'Soybean tariffs impact U.S. Midwest political swing states and come at a cost that China appears willing to pay,' Damien Courvalin, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in a report.The trade spat is the latest in a long list of farmer woes. An overhang of grain supplies has sparked a protracted struggle in the agricultural economy as crop prices stayed near historical lows. The decline in producer profits has crimped spending, hindering sales for companies like Monsanto. Years of sluggish profits have also forced more farmers to take out loans to keep afloat.The duties also come just as U.S. farmers are making acreage decisions for this season. While some growers have already begun sowing, the bulk of the Midwest will gear up for planting once weather conditions turn more favorable. The government last week had forecast soybeans to unseat corn as the largest-seeded domestic crop for the first time since the 1980s.Global demand for the oilseed has surged in recent years, driven by record Chinese purchases. China is the world's largest pork producer and relies on imports for feed supplies.U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad last month warned China against retaliatory measures aimed at imports of the oilseed and said any efforts to curb the trade would harm the Asian nation's regular citizens more than American growers. In an email on Wednesday, Paul Burke, North Asia Regional Director of the U.S. Soybean Export Council, said duties on soybeans will hurt both U.S. farmers as well as Chinese soy processing, animal producers and consumers.On Wednesday, May soybean futures fell as much as 5.3 percent in Chicago, a record loss for the contract, before paring the decline. The duty against U.S. soybeans isn't yet priced into the markets, as the tariff remains a threat with an unclear timeline, analysts at Rabobank International said in a report.Traders will continue to focus on the timing of the tariffs. U.S. soybean shipments typically fall at this time of year as buyers shift to Brazil, where the harvest is well under way.---Story by Megan Durisin.

"China's Ministry of Commerce said that starting Wednesday, Chinese importers of U.S. sorghum, used by the Chinese for animal feed and brewing alcohol, will be required to put down a 178.6 percent deposit in anticipation of anti-dumping tariffs. The deposits could discourage imports of U.S. sorghum, hurting American producers.The news came a day after the United States banned U.S. firms from selling parts to Chinese phone-maker ZTE Corps for seven years. The U.S. Commerce Department said ZTE violated an agreement reached after the company was caught shipping U.S. goods to Iran.In a separate development, the Chinese government announced a timeline for the lifting ownership limits on foreign automakers. The U.S. has long demanded better access to the Chinese market.These moves take place against a backdrop of heightened tension between the world's two largest economies. In recent months, the U.S. and China have exchanged escalating threats of tariffs worth billions of dollars.Hitting U.S. sorghum exports could hurt U.S. growers - potentially having an impact on farming states that have backed President Trump. The top five sorghum producing states are Kansas, Texas, Colorado and Oklahoma.Earlier this month China threatened tariffs against soybeans, pork and other U.S. agricultural products primarily produced in Trump-supporting states.Li Qiang, chief analyst at Shanghai JC Intelligence, an agriculture consultancy, said this year's crop had already been sold, but the news would 'certainly' have an impact on U.S. growers going forward.He saw the deposit move as a Chinese response to U.S. investigations into Chinese washing machines and photovoltaic panels. This is 'trade frictions,' he said, but not a 'trade war.'Chinese officials said the new measure was the result of a months-long investigation that concluded U.S. sorghum was being dumped on the Chinese market. Likely not coincidentally, U.S. critics often accuse China of dumping its own products, such as aluminum in January.The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said U.S. sorghum exports to China rose from 317,000 tons in 2013 to 4.76 million tons in 2017, while price of the exported sorghum fell 31 percent - harming Chinese farmers.'This approach is in line with the Chinese law and WTO rules, it aims at correcting unfair trade practices, maintain normal trade and competition order,' wrote Wang Hejun, director of the ministry's trade remedy and investigation bureau, in a statement.In China, sorghum is used in animal feed and also in the production of a popular type of Chinese liquor.Story by Emily Rauhala.

"The firm response Europe has pledged to planned U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports is likely to stop short of triggering the trade war that open market supporters fear.U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States would apply duties of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum to protect U.S. producers.The European Commission called the step a blatant intervention that amounted to protectionism. However, while promising to act â€œfirmlyâ€?, it made no mention of retaliation but instead spoke of counter-measures that conformed to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.Trump tweeted on Friday that trade wars are good and â€œeasy to winâ€?.â€œWhen a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,â€? his tweet read. â€œExample, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, donâ€™t trade anymore-we win big. Itâ€™s easy!â€?Brussels will join other countries in challenging the measures at the WTO and says it will also look into safeguards.Safeguard measures, last deployed in 2002 in response to steel import duties set by then U.S. President George W. Bush, would be designed to guard against a flood of imports resulting from the U.S. tariffs set to formally announced next week.However, they would have to apply to selected steel grades from all countries and so would hit producers from China, India, Russia, South Korea or Turkey.U.S. steel makes up less than 1 percent of EU steel imports.The European Union sees itself as a global counterweight to a protectionism-leaning Trump, sealing a trade deal with Japan, which had been part of a planned trans-Pacific trade alliance Trump withdrew from on his first day in office.The EU is also seeking to conclude free trade deals with Mexico, now in talks with the United States to save the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the Mercosur countries Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.Retaliation would go against its long-standing message that global trade should be free â€“ as well as fair.Data from European steel association Eurofer shows the United States was the destination of about 15 percent of Europeâ€™s steel exports in 2017, second behind Turkey with a 20 percent share.The 3.4 million tonnes crossing the Atlantic to the United States is about 2 percent of EU steel production. Including tubes, the figure is 5 million tonnes, which Eurofer warned could be cut in half by the U.S. measures.ArcelorMittal, the worldâ€™s biggest steelmaker with sizeable European and U.S. operations, said it was assessing the likely impact, although said that governments were right to take a tough approach to unfair trade.Turkeyâ€™s steel exporters association said it did not expect a major impact on their exports to the United States. They make up more than 5 percent of U.S. steel imports.Analysts from Jefferies said the actual measures announced next week could be more nuanced than an across-the-board 25 percent tariff for steel, which it said was politically unfeasible and viewed as a direct tax on U.S. consumers.Europe, they said, was likely to respond quickly with safeguard measures â€“ it took just 20 days to act in 2002 â€“ and EU producers could secure more open access to the United States than rivals.BSC analysts said the short-term impact for Russian steel stocks should be limited and said the measures were a â€œzero issueâ€? for aluminum producer Rusal <0486.HK >, which could easily send its products elsewhere at virtually no cost.Source: Reuters (Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop, Ceyda Caglayan in Istanbul, Robert-Jan Bartunek in Brussels, Sujata Rao-Coverley in London, Polina Devitt in Moscow; Editing by Angus MacSwan)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morgan is getting less optimistic about the trade conflict between the U.S. and China.The firm lowered its rating for Chinese equities to neutral from overweight, predicting the escalating trade war between the countries will affect China's economy next year.'A full-blown trade war becomes our new base case scenario for 2019,' emerging market strategist Pedro Martins Junior said in a note to clients Wednesday. 'There is no clear sign of mitigating confrontation between China and the US in the near term.'On Monday, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said discussions with China over trade aren't progressing.The White House's latest tariffs of 10 percent on $200 billion of imports from China took effect last week. President Donald Trump, in a Sept. 17 statement, said the tariffs would rise to 25 percent on Jan. 1.Junior said China's GDP growth could be negatively impacted by 1 percentage point from the latest round of announced tariffs, assuming it 'does not take countermeasures.''Higher tariffs are squeezing Chinese manufacturing's profit margin, reducing the investment incentive and hiring, which would then drag on consumption via reduced income,' he said.As a result, J.P.

"Beijing agreed in a joint statement with the U.S. to 'substantially reduce' America's trade deficit with ChinaWASHINGTON â€” The United States and China are pulling back from the brink of a trade war after the world's two biggest economies reported progress in talks aimed at bringing down America's massive trade deficit with Beijing.'We are putting the trade war on hold,' Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday.After high-level talks Thursday and Friday in Washington, Beijing agreed in a joint statement with the U.S. to 'substantially reduce' America's trade deficit with China, but did not commit to cut the gap by any specific amount. The Trump administration had sought to slash the deficit by $200 billion.Still, Mnuchin said the two countries had made 'meaningful progress' and that the administration has agreed to put on hold proposed tariffs on up to $150 billion in Chinese products. China had promised to retaliate in a move that threatened a tit for tat trade war.He said they expect to see a big increase â€” 35 percent to 45 percent this year alone â€” in U.S. farm sales to China. Mnuchin also forecast a doubling in sales of U.S. energy products to the Chinese market, increasing energy exports by $50 billion to $60 billion in the next three years to five years.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has been part of the U.S. negotiating team, will go to China soon to follow up on last week's discussions, Mnuchin said.In Saturday's statement, Beijing committed to 'significantly increase' its purchases of American goods and services, saying the increase would 'meet the growing consumption needs of the Chinese people and the need for high-quality economic development.'Last year, the U.S. had a record $376 billion deficit with China in the trade of goods; that was the largest by far with any nation.Trade analysts were not surprised that China refused to agree to a numerical target for cutting the trade gap, but they said the talks probably were more successful in easing trade tensions.'The Trump administration seems eager to engineer at minimum a temporary peace with China to ensure a smooth run-up to the Kim-Trump summit in June,' Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad said, referring to the June 12 meeting scheduled between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.If there is success in the U.S.-China discussions, analysts suggest it likely would involve the countries' presidents this fall before the November elections.'Part of the good news for markets: As long as both sides continue to be 'constructively' engaged, imposition of additional tariffs by either side is very unlikely,' analysts at investment management firm Evercore ISI said in a research note. 'There is no reason for either side â€” particularly the U.S. â€” to destroy the process that both sides are building, which is what imposing tariffs would do.'Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., praised the administration's efforts with China.'It's smart to engage China on trade abuses, and it would also be smart to get them more involved in trying to help us with North Korea,' Graham said.Trump campaigned in 2016 on a pledge to get tough on China and other U.S. trading partners. He views the U.S. trade deficit with China as evidence that Beijing is engaged in abusive trading practices and has outmaneuvered previous U.S. administrations.Last August, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer began investigating Beijing's strong-arm tactics to challenge U.S. technological dominance. These include outright cybertheft of U.S. companies' trade secrets and China's demands that American corporations hand over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese markets.Last month, the administration proposed tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports to protest the forced technology transfers. Trump later ordered Lighthizer to seek up to an additional $100 billion in Chinese products to tax.China responded by targeting $50 billion in U.S. products, including soybeans â€” a shot at Trump supporters in America's heartland. The prospect of an escalating trade war has shaken financial markets and alarmed business leaders.In a separate controversy, the Commerce Department last month blocked China's ZTE Corp. from importing American components for seven years, accusing the telecommunications company of misleading U.S. regulators after it settled charges last year of violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea.The ban amounted to a death sentence for ZTE, which relies heavily on U.S. parts, and the company announced that it was halting operations. A week ago, Trump tweeted that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to put ZTE 'back in business, fast.' Media reports suggested that the U.S. was offering to swap a ZTE rescue for an end to proposed Chinese tariffs on U.S. farm products.Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called Trump's intervention in the case 'outrageous' and said that using ZTE 'as a bargaining chip ... is not in the best interests of our national security.'White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said there could be 'some small changes around the edges' in the sanctions against ZTE. But Kudlow added: 'Do not expect ZTE to get off scot-free. It ain't gonna happen.'Mnuchin and Graham appeared on 'Fox News Sunday,' Warner spoke on CNN's 'State of the Union' and Kudlow was interviewed on ABC's 'This Week.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the Trump administration rolls out federal aid for the agriculture industry caught in an escalating international trade war, Oklahoma farmers are waiting for a permanent solution to an uncertain future.Tariffs like those from China, imposed in July 2018 on $50 billion worth of U.S. exports, are hitting several sectors of Oklahomaâ€™s agricultural industry. Those tariffs are in retaliation to the Trump administrationâ€™s tariffs on billions worth of Chinese industrial goods this summer.The escalating trade war could become costly to the stateâ€™s farmers. Oklahoma is not the hardest-hit state in this continuing trade war, but soybeans and pork, both among Oklahomaâ€™s largest agricultural exports, are both subject to the 25 percent Chinese tariffs.The Trump administration is offering financial and subsidy assistance to affected farmers through a $12 billion emergency aid package, available through applications. Payments worth $4.7 million for cotton, soybean, pork, wheat, dairy, sorghum and corn farmers opened for application in early September through the Market Facilitation Program.While the payoffs are immediately helpful, theyâ€™re less than ideal for Oklahoma farmers in the long run, said soybean farmer Brent Rendel.â€œIt's positive because obviously it's better than to not get them at all, but the reality is, I don't know of anybody who accepts that as worth going through the trade war at all,â€? Rendel said. â€œEveryone I've heard from says it's too bad that we're even having to do thisâ€¦ a better help would just be to get through the situation that we're in and resolve it. I think everybody would rather not get the payment and resolve the trade issues in a more expeditious manner.â€?Despite the growing importance and profitability of soybeans in Oklahoma over the past few years, Rendel said soybean farmers have already lost 10 to 15 percent of the market value of their crop over the past few months due to the Chinese trade war, which could mean some wonâ€™t break even this year. U.S. soybeans are generally used as feed for pigs in China, the worldâ€™s top 1 pork producer.â€œI think everyone in the United States would tend to agree that the playing field between the United States and China has not been level, and that the advantage has gone to China,â€? Rendel said. â€œI don't know what the correct method to get the playing field balanced is. This is one approach, and until we go through it, I don't think we can say whether it's the right or the wrong approach.â€?Roy Lee Lindsey, executive director of the Oklahoma Pork Council, said while pork has been a growing export market thatâ€™s produced a significant amount of product this year, that product is selling at reduced prices, reducing the global competitiveness of U.S. pork producers. As of just over a month ago, the U.S. pork industry had seen a loss of $18 per head of hog since the beginning of the trade discussion, Lindsey said.â€œWe never anticipated that 2018 was going to be a great year in terms of profitability, but we did anticipate it would be profitable,â€? Lindsey said. â€œIf we're enduring $18 a head losses right now, there's no way that the year turns out to be profitable. And so our producers are just kind of in hunker down mode: â€˜How do we, how do we survive through this?â€™... â€˜How do we navigate this bump in the road with these tariffs?â€™â€?The government is now buying up U.S. pork to move the product off the market and into institutions like food banks â€œto help folks that are less fortunate,â€? a move Lindsey said is â€œgood policy.â€? Itâ€™s a helpful move for now, Lindsey said, but not one that provides a long-term solution.â€œWhile we appreciate that, what we need is a resolution to these trade disputes long term so that we have some long-term certainty,â€? Lindsey said. â€œMarkets don't like uncertainty. Producers don't like uncertainty. We all want to know what the landscape looks like down the road â€” what's the map look like out in the future?â€?Jordan Shearer and other Oklahoma sorghum farmers have been feeling that uncertainty for most of 2018.Shearer, who works with the Oklahoma Sorghum Commission, said in 2017, two-thirds of U.S.-grown sorghum was sold to China. Two common types of sorghum are forage sorghum, used for livestock grazing or hay, and grain sorghum, a widely-consumed cereal grain.After a Chinese investigation into U.S. sorghum in early 2018, the Chinese government imposed a month-long 178.6 percent tariff on U.S sorghum. The USDA helped negotiate sorghum growers out of the steep tariff, but the industry is still facing the 25 percent tariff China imposed across many American exports in July.The 2018 sorghum harvest is just beginning, so many farmers havenâ€™t yet been able to apply for the administrationâ€™s subsidy program, Shearer said.â€œWe appreciate the FDA's support in that, but still we'd much rather have the open market and not have these type of disaster programs,â€? Shearer said.Some pressures on farmers will ease when the NAFTA agreement, which sets trade terms between the United States, Mexico and Canada, is secure, Lindsey said. The Trump administration announced a renegotiated NAFTA, now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Sept. 30.The U.S. will also have to seek out new trade partners or strengthen bonds with existing partners, Lindsey said.For now, the ongoing trade disputes mean the next yearâ€™s worth of selling, planting and harvesting looks uncertain for farmers, Rendel said.â€œClearly if soybean prices continue to be depressed due to the trade negotiations and trade war, then that's really got to come into play as far as what you're going to do in 2019,â€? Rendel said. â€œIf it looks like the trade situation is going to remain in flux and it's not going to get resolved, then decisions will clearly be made that will favor other crops moreso.â€?Shearer said sorghum is projected to yield a large crop this year, but prices are depressed and thereâ€™s â€œa lot of anxietyâ€? about what the next year will look like, â€œespecially if the trade situation continues to deteriorate.â€?â€œWe've got a lot of young growers that, people that have come back and to the farm in the last 10 years, they've gotten some high dollar land and equipment and have been struggling with low prices anyhow,â€? Shearer said. â€œThis could really be the ruin of a whole, we could lose a whole generation of farmers. I mean, not saying that's going to happen, but it could be.

"US challenges trade war counter-tariffs against Turkey at WTOWASHINGTONThe United States has launched challenges at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to hit back at the major trading partners, including Turkey, that have retaliated against President Donald Trumpâ€™s tariffs on metals and goods from China.Washington opened separate disputes against China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico, along with Turkey, challenging the counter-tariffs those countries have imposed on American farm exports and machinery, the U.S. Trade Representative said in a statement.Despite outrage over the U.S. actions, the White House says alleged unfair trade by these economies means Trumpâ€™s stinging tariffs are justified - but retaliation is not.â€œThe actions taken by the president are wholly legitimate and fully justified as a matter of US law and international trade rules,â€? U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement on July 16.â€œInstead of working with us to address a common problem, some of our trading partners have elected to respond with retaliatory tariffs designed to punish American workers, farmers and companies.â€?Lighthizer said the counter-tariffs breached WTO obligations.Since March, Trump has ratcheted up pressure on China and traditional allies, imposing tariffs on scores of billions of imports in steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar panels and broad swathes of Chinese manufactured goods and machinery.Mexicoâ€™s Economy Ministry vowed to defend itself against the new U.S. actions at the WTO.â€œThe measures applied by Mexico were in response to the duties imposed, unjustly and with national security argument, by the U.S. government on imports of Mexican steel aluminum,â€? the ministry said in a statement.â€œU.S. purchases of Mexican steel and aluminum do not represent a national security threat to that country.â€?According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports - targeted to cause pain in the voting areas on which the governing Republican party relies heavily - now cover about $75 billion in American exports.Trump this month responded to Beijingâ€™s retaliatory duties on American goods by formally beginning a process which could see tariffs imposed on an additional $200 billion in Chinese products as soon as September.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that growing trade restrictions were â€œthe greatest near-term threatâ€? to the world economy, amid projections for slower growth in Germany, France, Japan and China.â€œIf countries could cooperate to revise the multilateral system in a way that allowed them better to address the tensions that have been out there, that would be very positive for global growth,â€? IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld told reporters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"How do you invest for a trade war? The current consensus, at least as measured by ETF returns, is to think U.S. and to think small.President Donald J. Trump fired the first salvo on trade March 9 when he announced $25 billion in tariffs on steel and aluminum. He has since threatened another $150 billion in tariffs against China. The Standard & Poor's 500 has fallen 4.8% since then, according to Morningstar Inc.But some exchange-traded funds have held up much better than the S&P 500.One category that stands out: small-company ETFs, which have fallen 2.38% since the first shots in the trade war rang out. Pacer US Small Cap Cash Cows 100 ETF (CALF) is the top-performing small-cap ETF since then, gaining 0.37% As its name implies, it invests in small companies with lots of free cash flow.'Small caps underperformed last year, and were major beneficiaries of the tax overhaul,' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for U.S. equities at CFRA. 'Most importantly, they tend to be more domestically focused and therefore less hindered by tariffs.'Another strategy is to avoid sectors that involve trade. That's a tricky proposition, since about half the earnings of S&P 500 companies come from abroad.One sector to consider: utilities, because it's hard to import electricity. PowerShares DWA Utilities Momentum Portfolio (PUI), for example, has gained 4.23% since the trade wars started.Another sector that doesn't depend on trade: real estate. Nushares Short-Term REIT ETF (NURE), for example, has gained 3.37% since March 9.Trade wars aren't bad for all sectors, and some areas have been untouched by the threat. For example, oil and gas ETFs have risen sharply since Mr. Trump announced tariffs. Part of the reason is that the International Energy Agency warned that the oil industry was not investing enough in new supply. That was enough to boost the price of oil â€” and the prices of energy ETFs. United States Brent Oil ETF (BNO), for example, has gained 5.89% since the start of the trade war threats.Some international funds that specialize in the oil patch have fared well, too. The iShares MSCI Qatar ETF (QAT) has jumped 8.11% since the start of the trade wars, and iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia (KSA) is up 7.01%. The Wisdom Tree Middle East Dividend ETF (GULF) has risen 3.40%.Finally, at least one area has benefitted from the talk of a trade war. Last year, Mr. Trump announced tariffs on Canadian timber â€” which pushed up lumber prices in the U.S. The iShares Global Timber and Forestry ETF (WOOD) has grown 3.68%. And the Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whisky and Spirits ETF (WSKY) has gained 2.50% on threats of European tariffs on Kentucky bourbon.Whether it's wise to base your investments on trade policy is another matter. The stock market rallied strongly Monday, something that Mr. Stovall chalks up to hopes that cooler heads will prevail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BEIJING, China â€” China has assured governments of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), which have been keeping a close watch on the deepening trade row between that Asian country and the the United States, that the Chinese Government will not harm their economic ties.At the same time, however, China has indicated that should the fresh wave of trade dispute escalate into an all out war, countries within the regional bloc should expect some level of fall-out.Chinese state officials have insisted on using the term â€œtrade conflictâ€? to describe the dispute which has intensified over the past several days after Washington last Monday issued a list of Chinese export products, worth US$50 billion, against which the Donald Trump Administration has proposed levy of an additional 25 per cent in import duties.The US said it was moving to impose additional duties under Section 301 of US Trade Act, as a result of an investigation into China's intellectual property policies and practices.Addressing journalists from the Caribbean and Latin American region at China's foreign affairs ministry here Sunday, Han Jing, counsellor in the ministry's Department of Latin America and Caribbean, stated: â€œSome other countries and regions will feel the pinch of the trade dispute between China and America but we will uphold WTO system and rules in our trade relations with them. China will always be a defender and contributor to multilateral trade systems. We will not harm our economic relations and trade ties with the Caribbean and Latin American countriesâ€?.Han argued that trade disputes among countries are normal but that these should be addressed through consultation.â€œThe method taken by the United States runs counter to the spirit of the WTO (World Trade Organization). It is not beneficial to the interest of US consumers and it's national interest. It will also harm China's national interest of course, or even the economic interest of the whole world,â€? he said.Han, like China's vice-minister of commerce Wang Shouwen did at a news conference last Wednesday, stressed that China does not want the trade war with the US, but warned that â€?we are not afraid of it eitherâ€?.The US is targeting 1,300 Chinese products in the dispute with China.China has since retaliated with its own list of 106 US goods worth a corresponding US$50 billion in annual trade, for tariffs. The list targeted for additional tariffs cover 14 categories of goods and includes passenger airplanes, chemicals, and soybeans.In response, President Trump has now asked the US trade representative to consider US$100 billion in additional tariffs, according to a White House release issued on Thursday.â€œIn light of China's unfair retaliation, I have instructed the USTR to consider whether US$100 billion of additional tariffs would be appropriate under Section 301 (of the US Trade Act) and, if so, to identify the products upon which to impose such tariffs,â€? the statement said.Section 301 authorises the US president to: â€œTake all appropriate action, including retaliation, to obtain the removal of any act, policy, or practice of a foreign government that violates an international trade agreement or is unjustified, unreasonable, or discriminatory, and that burdens or restricts US commerce.â€?At the same time, China has also filed a request for consultation with the WTO under its dispute settlement framework over US tariffs totalling 35 per cent on steel and alumina imports, which China said can affect it and other countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Iowa farmers, businesses and our entire state economy could be deeply affected by the escalating global trade war.Tariffs have been ordered on imported steel, aluminum and technology. Other countries are responding in kind, proposing tariffs on U.S. exports, including pork, corn and soybeans, which are critical to Iowaâ€™s economy.Trade conflicts have already cost Iowa $560 million. This could have been avoided. In April, I joined 20 other Iowa state senators in asking President Trump to consider the negative consequences on Iowa farmers, rural communities and all whose livelihood is threatened by a trade war.According to the Tax Foundation, â€œThe resulting net loss in economic activity is the price all of us will have to pay.â€?For example, Sukup Manufacturing and its 600 Iowa employees in tiny Sheffield could be hit hard by tariffs on the million pounds of steel they use each week to make grain bins and dryers.Tariffs on imported steel and aluminum also put Iowa at a trade disadvantage when our farmers â€œconvert grain into cars, metals and almost any other type of good conceivable.â€?Finally, new tariffs on cars could amount to a $73 billion tax increase, with the burden falling heavily on low-income families. Auto tariffs would wipe out many of the gains low-income Iowans were counting on from federal tax cuts â€“ while barely impacting top income earners.Shifting more of the tax burden to low-income workers is not the direction we want to go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Almost two months after President Donald Trump placed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, several major businesses in the Kansas City area are calling for the trade war to end, although many of them have yet to feel the full effect.The Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce and six businesses, representing a variety of interests, held a news conference about tariffs Tuesday.Kansas City, Missouri-based craft brewery Boulevard Brewing Company talked about the aluminum market, which is where they source their materials for cans.Boulevard is owned by Duvel USA, who sent Director of Supply Chain Justin Deardorff to speak. He said the company wonâ€™t see the effect of tariffs until September, when Boulevard has to negotiate a contract for its aluminum cans.â€œOur focus is on quality in premium beer but we want to keep that affordable for consumers,â€? Deardorff said, adding this could affect pricing.Meanwhile, Union Pacific, which has a major presence in Kansas City, relies on Japanese steel imports, which since June has had a 25 percent tariff. UP spokeswoman Lindsey Douglas said the first shipment of steel post-tariff went up by $6 million, causing it sit in San Francisco for four weeks. (Douglas declined to comment when asked how much steel was in that shipment.)She said that Union Pacific disagrees with the Trump administration's approach, but not with the underlying message.â€œUnion Pacific strongly supports the administration for its efforts to level the playing field for American workers when it comes to trade, particularly when it comes to Chinaâ€™s trade practices,â€? Douglas said, adding that the company is in favor of renegotiating trade deals.Other businesses like meat processor Smithfield Foods and Missouri Soybean Association vice president Ronnie Russell said theyâ€™re worried about the tariffs that China, Mexico and Canada put on U.S. goods as retaliation.The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that theyâ€™ll offer up to $12 billion worth of aid to farmers. And at a speech in Kansas City last week, Trump asked people to â€œbe a little patientâ€? when it comes to resolving trade disputes.Russell, who is also a soybean farmer, said tariffs shouldnâ€™t be a political issue.â€œMy concern is are we going to be able to survive until the end,â€? Russell said, adding, â€œa lot of people try to make this a political issue and let me just say farmers are blue. Farmers are red. Farmers are independent.â€œThis is not a political issue, this is a policy issue.â€?Aviva Okeson-Haberman is a KCUR news intern.

"Copyright 2018 CNN Donald Trump's chief economic adviser Larry KudlowCopyright 2018 CNN Donald Trump's chief economic adviser Larry KudlowHONG KONG (CNNMoney) - China on Friday accused the United States of starting 'the biggest trade war in economic history' as the two sides imposed steep new tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of each other's exports.The Trump administration's 25% tariffs affect more than 800 Chinese products worth $34 billion such as industrial machinery, medical devices and auto parts. They kicked in just after midnight ET, which is noon in Beijing.China's tariffs on US goods came into effect immediately afterward, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Friday.Trump and his advisers argue the tariffs are necessary to pressure China into abandoning unfair practices such as stealing intellectual property and forcing American companies to hand over valuable technology.Beijing insists it's the injured party.'China is forced to strike back to safeguard core national interests and the interests of its people,' the Commerce Ministry said in a statement on Friday. It accused the United States of 'typical trade bullying.'The government said previously it would hit more than 500 US export items â€” including cars and major agricultural goods such as soybeans and meat â€” worth the same as the Chinese products targeted by the United States.Even before Friday, the trade dispute between the world's top two economies had rattled markets and prompted warnings from companies of damage to their bottom lines and higher prices for consumers.American companies doing business in China are particularly worried.'Increased tensions in the US-China economic relationship will negatively impact ... operations in China,' William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said in a statement Friday.Trump threatens another $500 billionThe big question is how far the hostilities between Washington and Beijing will go.The United States is also set to impose 25% tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese exports later in the summer, and China has vowed to retaliate against US goods worth a similar amount.Economists say that if the back-and-forth stops there, the overall impact on both economies will be minimal even though some industries will suffer.But Trump has said his administration will respond to retaliation from Beijing with much bigger waves of tariffs, raising the prospect of worsening tit-for-tat reprisals. On Thursday, he suggested the possibility of tariffs on almost $500 billion more of Chinese goods.He described the potential escalation to reporters aboard Air Force One: 'Thirty-four, and then you have another 16 in two weeks and then, as you know, we have 200 billion in abeyance and then after the 200 billion we have 300 billion in abeyance. OK?' Trump said. 'So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300.'That amount is higher than an earlier threat from Trump to target as much as $450 billion of Chinese exports. It's also bigger than the $506 billion of goods that the United States imported from China last year.'We urge the two governments to come back to the negotiation table with the aim of having productive discussions based on achieving results -- focused on fairness and reciprocal treatment -- instead of escalating the current situation,' said Zarit of the American Chamber of Commerce.Underpinning the dispute is Trump's anger at America's $376 billion deficit in goods trade with China.Despite three rounds of negotiations between the two sides, including a Chinese pledge to significantly increase purchases of American products, Trump decided to go ahead with the tariffs.The clash with China comes as the Trump administration is also fighting over trade with American allies such as Canada and the European Union. US tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have provoked retaliatory measures against billions of dollars of American exports. Trump has added to the tension by threatening new tariffs on cars.For the time being, analysts say it's hard to see Washington or Beijing backing down in the dispute.'By threatening unilateral action without having any allies and not reducing domestic discord on trade, the Trump administration has invited China to stand tough,' said Scott Kennedy, director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.'The Trump administration also believes that at least starting a trade war is in its interests; the US economy is strong enough to endure a crimp in trade, the president's domestic political standing is as strong as ever amongst Republicans, and pushing China hard on trade may help restore US credibility on other issues,' he added.Reaching a deal will be toughThe two giant economies appear ready to see which side can endure the most pain. The damage could also spread to other economies, hurting business confidence and prompting companies to delay investments.Kennedy say he thinks the Trump administration's enthusiasm for the conflict 'will erode as the economic pain and political fallout from a trade war begin to take hold. At that point, the US will be more interested in negotiations, and the Chinese side will also want to come to the table.'But reaching a deal that's palatable to both sides will be tough. For example, the US government wants China to rein in government subsidies for policies like 'Made in China 2025,' which seeks to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into industries such as robotics, electric cars and computer chips with the aim of becoming a global leader.Analysts say China is unlikely to budge on those plans, which it sees as crucial for developing its huge economy.'It's still hard for me to believe the Trump administration could develop and negotiate an overarching package with China that genuinely sticks,' Kennedy said. 'And so I'd expect the two sides to pursue some sort of face-saving deal that looks good on paper but is not enduring.'-- Steven Jiang and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the Trump administration rolls out federal aid for the agriculture industry caught in an escalating international trade war, Oklahoma farmers are waiting for a permanent solution to an uncertain future.Tariffs like those from China, imposed in July 2018 on $50 billion worth of U.S. exports, are hitting several sectors of Oklahomaâ€™s agricultural industry. Those tariffs are in retaliation to the Trump administrationâ€™s tariffs on billions worth of Chinese industrial goods this summer.The escalating trade war could become costly to the stateâ€™s farmers. Oklahoma is not the hardest-hit state in this continuing trade war, but soybeans and pork, both among Oklahomaâ€™s largest agricultural exports, are both subject to the 25 percent Chinese tariffs.The Trump administration is offering financial and subsidy assistance to affected farmers through a $12 billion emergency aid package, available through applications. Payments worth $4.7 million for cotton, soybean, pork, wheat, dairy, sorghum and corn farmers opened for application in early September through the Market Facilitation Program.While the payoffs are immediately helpful, theyâ€™re less than ideal for Oklahoma farmers in the long run, said soybean farmer Brent Rendel.â€œIt's positive because obviously it's better than to not get them at all, but the reality is, I don't know of anybody who accepts that as worth going through the trade war at all,â€? Rendel said. â€œEveryone I've heard from says it's too bad that we're even having to do thisâ€¦ a better help would just be to get through the situation that we're in and resolve it. I think everybody would rather not get the payment and resolve the trade issues in a more expeditious manner.â€?Despite the growing importance and profitability of soybeans in Oklahoma over the past few years, Rendel said soybean farmers have already lost 10 to 15 percent of the market value of their crop over the past few months due to the Chinese trade war, which could mean some wonâ€™t break even this year. U.S. soybeans are generally used as feed for pigs in China, the worldâ€™s top 1 pork producer.â€œI think everyone in the United States would tend to agree that the playing field between the United States and China has not been level, and that the advantage has gone to China,â€? Rendel said. â€œI don't know what the correct method to get the playing field balanced is. This is one approach, and until we go through it, I don't think we can say whether it's the right or the wrong approach.â€?Roy Lee Lindsey, executive director of the Oklahoma Pork Council, said while pork has been a growing export market thatâ€™s produced a significant amount of product this year, that product is selling at reduced prices, reducing the global competitiveness of U.S. pork producers. As of just over a month ago, the U.S. pork industry had seen a loss of $18 per head of hog since the beginning of the trade discussion, Lindsey said.â€œWe never anticipated that 2018 was going to be a great year in terms of profitability, but we did anticipate it would be profitable,â€? Lindsey said. â€œIf we're enduring $18 a head losses right now, there's no way that the year turns out to be profitable. And so our producers are just kind of in hunker down mode: â€˜How do we, how do we survive through this?â€™... â€˜How do we navigate this bump in the road with these tariffs?â€™â€?The government is now buying up U.S. pork to move the product off the market and into institutions like food banks â€œto help folks that are less fortunate,â€? a move Lindsey said is â€œgood policy.â€? Itâ€™s a helpful move for now, Lindsey said, but not one that provides a long-term solution.â€œWhile we appreciate that, what we need is a resolution to these trade disputes long term so that we have some long-term certainty,â€? Lindsey said. â€œMarkets don't like uncertainty. Producers don't like uncertainty. We all want to know what the landscape looks like down the road â€” what's the map look like out in the future?â€?Jordan Shearer and other Oklahoma sorghum farmers have been feeling that uncertainty for most of 2018.Shearer, who works with the Oklahoma Sorghum Commission, said in 2017, two-thirds of U.S.-grown sorghum was sold to China. Two common types of sorghum are forage sorghum, used for livestock grazing or hay, and grain sorghum, a widely-consumed cereal grain.After a Chinese investigation into U.S. sorghum in early 2018, the Chinese government imposed a month-long 178.6 percent tariff on U.S sorghum. The USDA helped negotiate sorghum growers out of the steep tariff, but the industry is still facing the 25 percent tariff China imposed across many American exports in July.The 2018 sorghum harvest is just beginning, so many farmers havenâ€™t yet been able to apply for the administrationâ€™s subsidy program, Shearer said.â€œWe appreciate the FDA's support in that, but still we'd much rather have the open market and not have these type of disaster programs,â€? Shearer said.Some pressures on farmers will ease when the NAFTA agreement, which sets trade terms between the United States, Mexico and Canada, is secure, Lindsey said. The Trump administration announced a renegotiated NAFTA, now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Sept. 30.The U.S. will also have to seek out new trade partners or strengthen bonds with existing partners, Lindsey said.For now, the ongoing trade disputes mean the next yearâ€™s worth of selling, planting and harvesting looks uncertain for farmers, Rendel said.â€œClearly if soybean prices continue to be depressed due to the trade negotiations and trade war, then that's really got to come into play as far as what you're going to do in 2019,â€? Rendel said. â€œIf it looks like the trade situation is going to remain in flux and it's not going to get resolved, then decisions will clearly be made that will favor other crops moreso.â€?Shearer said sorghum is projected to yield a large crop this year, but prices are depressed and thereâ€™s â€œa lot of anxietyâ€? about what the next year will look like, â€œespecially if the trade situation continues to deteriorate.â€?â€œWe've got a lot of young growers that, people that have come back and to the farm in the last 10 years, they've gotten some high dollar land and equipment and have been struggling with low prices anyhow,â€? Shearer said. â€œThis could really be the ruin of a whole, we could lose a whole generation of farmers. I mean, not saying that's going to happen, but it could be. It's in the cards.â€?Gaylord News is a Washington reporting project of the Gaylord College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Oklahoma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Copyright 2018 CNN President Donald Trump is seen here speaking at the White House on March 1, 2018.Copyright 2018 CNN President Donald Trump is seen here speaking at the White House on March 1, 2018.WASHINGTON (CNN) - President Donald Trump's vow to enact revenge on China for 'killing' the US on trade was a signature refrain of the 2016 campaign, but his latest tough talk risks stoking an adversarial economic standoff with Beijing that could prompt geopolitical retaliation on issues ranging from North Korea to the South China Sea.Trump's surprise announcement on Thursday that the US will institute tariffs on steel and aluminum imports has upset stock markets, angered US allies around the world and even drawn criticism from members of his own party -- but whether it represents the start of a global trade war is likely to depend on China's reaction.Beijing's immediate response Friday was measured in tone -- urging the US 'to abide by the multilateral trade rules and make contributions to the international trade and economic order' -- and concerns about potential retaliation for the tariffs have largely centered on China imposing its own punishing economic measures.But Chinese officials have previously warned they are willing to do what they think is necessary to 'defend our rights' should Trump introduce additional measures that target the Communist nation more heavily and directly.In addition to the vast array of painful economic response options at its disposal, China could target US geopolitical interests if Trump escalates trade tensions.'When we go to the next step and take action against China on investment and trade that will be much more significant, and then you will see their response spill over into other areas,' according to Wendy Cutler, a former diplomat and negotiator who serves as the vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute.One concern is that China could respond to a more focused American trade campaign by slowing its cooperation on implementing sanctions against North Korea, a key component of the Trump administration's 'maximum pressure campaign' to bring Pyongyang to the negotiating table over its nuclear programs.US intelligence officials warn that North Korea could be just a few months away from achieving its goal of putting a warhead on a missile that could reach the American mainland.Administration officials have emphasized that it is the goal of sanctions and diplomatic pressure to push into the future as far as possible the point at which the US might have to decide whether to engage in military action to stop North Korea.But that window -- and any margin for error -- appears to be rapidly shrinking.Despite implementing a series of sanctions on North Korea in recent months, US officials have long indicated that China must play a key role in implementing the measures -- and some experts warn that an adversarial trade policy would only add to the already difficult challenge of convincing Beijing to forcefully engage on the issue.'The US is doing what it can to ratchet up sanctions pressure on North Korea, but that won't be enough unless the Chinese do the same,' a former State Department official told CNN. 'There's a serious risk that dissatisfaction with President Trump's trade policies will dampen China's willingness to cooperate and help move the ball forward on North Korea.''North Korea is already very skilled at evasion, and if China and Russia are not doing what they can to prevent it we are going to be in a longer term situation where the sanctions are not effective enough to provide any real incentive for North Korea to seriously pursue a diplomatic track,' the former official added.Some argue that China's reduced influence over Kim Jong Un's regime and own self-interest might prevent it from purposefully sabotaging efforts to peacefully denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, but Beijing also holds additional cards should the US target its trade interests.China could also respond to escalating trade tensions by raising the temperature in the East and South China seas or potentially making life harder in the United Nations Security Council on other issues.'I can see them deciding that it's appropriate to cause trouble for us with allies,' said William Reinsch, the Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Ultimately, only time will tell how Trump and China will choose to proceed.A senior administration official told CNN that the 'Chinese reaction will depend on the modesty or severity of the actions POTUS takes' but also on whether 'China is singled out or is one of many.''It's just too early to tell,' the official said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON â€” Americaâ€™s government declares â€œwarâ€? promiscuously â€” on poverty, on drugs, on cancer, etc. â€” except when actually going to war, which the nation has done often since it last declared war (on June 5, 1942, on Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary). But the incipient war du jour is being postponed. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says the Trump administration is â€œputting the trade war on hold.â€? The one with China, that is. Others can continue.The armistice-before-the-war is good news for farmers, who could use some. USA Today reports that the net income of U.S. farmers has fallen by more than half since 2013, to its lowest point since 2006, the steepest decline since the Depression. For this, blame productive farming around the world (supply outpacing demand), rotten weather in America, and perverse government in Washington. China and Mexico, responding to uncertainties caused by U.S. indignation (about China selling too much to consenting American adults, and about NAFTA enabling mighty Mexico to exploit America), are finding alternative sources of soybeans, pork and beef.There is nothing like a calamity for taking oneâ€™s mind off oneâ€™s troubles, and anti-immigration Republicans have another affliction for American farmers. The Wall Street Journal reports that about half of agriculture workers are undocumented immigrants. Because more Mexicans have left than entered the United States between 2009 and 2014, the immigrant agriculture labor force is aging â€” and moving to higher-paying construction jobs. The Journal: â€œAs farmers struggle to find workers, more production has moved abroad. Avocado imports have doubled over the last eight years while U.S. production (measured by acreage) has declined by about a quarter. Since 1999, domestic production has fallen for oranges (by 36 percent), grapefruits (61 percent) and asparagus (69 percent). Imports of fresh fruits and vegetables have swelled. â€¦ This hurts workers in related industries like transportation and food processing.â€? This is the Republicansâ€™ approach to succoring â€œvictims of globalization.â€?Mortgage rates have risen to the highest level since 2011, they are far from done rising, and a National Association of Realtors economist says that every percentage-point increase can reduce home sales 7 to 8 percent. Simultaneously, the administrationâ€™s protectionism is further increasing the cost of homeownership with tariffs on imported Canadian lumber (framing lumber is about 18 percent of the average new homeâ€™s selling price). Bloomberg Businessweek says this adds an average of $1,360 to the cost of building a single-family home, the price of which has risen $6,388 since January 2017. Steel can sometimes be used as a substitute for lumber, except â€¦In the 1830s, in Grand Detour, Illinois, a young blacksmith designed a self-scouring steel plow that could turn the Midwestâ€™s heavy black topsoil. John Deere then started a company and now his name is on big green machines everywhere. Today, however, the administrationâ€™s steel tariffs are causing Deere & Co. to raise prices, which will injure its competitiveness, unless the demand for American machinery is price-inelastic. Perhaps the Trump administrationâ€™s protectionists, who know so much (how much Americans should consume of this and that import, and at what prices), know this about the machinery market.Not content with bossing around Americans, even unto telling them which washing machines to buy, the administrationâ€™s protectionists have demanded that Mexico, as part of a renegotiated NAFTA, institute a $16 minimum wage for Mexican factory workers. So, a Republican administration purports to know more than Mexicoâ€™s labor market knows about the proper price of Mexican labor. But, then, the last know-it-all administration so aggressive about controlling wages and prices was Republican (Richard Nixonâ€™s).All this dictating and renegotiating is supposed to protect American jobs from the menace of NAFTA, which according to one of its ardent critics destroyed 1 million U.S. jobs in its first 20 years (1994-2014). An academic study argues that trade with China destroyed 2.4 million jobs between 1999 and 2011. But Don Boudreaux of George Mason Universityâ€™s Mercatus Center says this means it took NAFTA two decades to destroy as many jobs as are erased by the normal churning of the American job market on average every 18 days. And the so-called â€œChina shockâ€? eliminated in 13 years as many jobs as are eliminated by the U.S. economyâ€™s process of creative destruction, on average, every 41 days. So, if there are to be trade â€œwarsâ€? with China and Mexico, they will be launched to avenge job â€œcasualtiesâ€? that are far fewer than those routinely inflicted by the domestic processes that produce American prosperity.George Will https://www.limaohio.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2018/05/web1_WILL-George-Color-1-4.jpg George WillBy George F.

"The Costs of a Full Blown Trade War, Should One HappenThe US and China have announced tariffs on each otherâ€™s goods recently, and have threatened to impose more.Assuming they take effect, the tariffs that China has announced so far on American goods will focus on agricultural products, automobiles, aircraft and chemicals.Although exports of these industries to China are sizable, exports of the agricultural and other primary products industry totaled nearly $20-B in Y 2016, they represent a relatively small proportion of total industry output.For exampleUS exports to China are equivalent to less than 5% of the output of the agricultural and other primary products industry.In HeffX-LTNâ€™s view, Chinese tariffs on these 4 broad industries would not a big deal from a macroeconomic perspective.The Big Q: What happens if a full-blown trade war were to develop?The Big A: In a worst-case scenario in which each country were to levy increased tariffs on all of the goods that the other country exports, the overall effect on the US economy would be manageable.The estimated value added in American exports to China accounts for only 0.5% of total value added in the US economy.The other way aroundChinaâ€™s exports to the United States generate about 2% of itâ€™s value added. It appears that China would have more to lose than the United States from an all-out trade war, should one develop, which is not likely.But if one should develop, the potential consequences for the US is that share prices would decline, and lower wealth could lead to slower growth in US consumer spending.Plus, bond yields in the United States could rise if China was to off some of its sizable holdings of US Treasury securities. Which is also, not likely.America FirstHave a terrific weekend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Give credit to Alberta Premier Rachel Notley for the best conversion of a punchline to an actual news headline since Americans elected a reality-show billionaire to the presidency. The new ban on wines from British Columbiaâ€”which leaped from a dark joke to a Fort McMurray restaurateurâ€™s quirky protest to government policyâ€”turns out to be one of the easiest retaliatory measures Notley could enact in response to B.C. proposal to restrict new bitumen transmission. Unlike products such as beef, tree fruit or lumber, wine flows into Alberta through a single (ahem) pipelineâ€”the provincial liquor commission, through which all liquor stores and agents must go. And the government could easily pinch that point.Itâ€™s also a move thatâ€™s highly visible on both sides of the Canadian Rockies; while this issue has been the singular obsession for a week in oil-dependent Alberta, it has competed for attention in B.C. with auto insurance reforms, the opioid crisis and the ever-present housing file. Alberta, by dragging the proud export of the Okanagan Valley into this spat, has swiped a leather glove against its neighbourâ€™s cheek.Thusly provoked, B.C.ers will defensively stock up on their provinceâ€™s wines, just as Albertans patriotically bought beef last decade when the U.S. border snapped shut due to one Canadian bovine contracting mad cow disease. So far, John Horgan has resisted the traditional political imperative to retaliate and defend his wine producersâ€”a chance for the B.C. premier to rally voters behind him on something they mostly love (wine) for the sake of something that divides them (pipelines). Instead, his response Wednesday was to call Notleyâ€™s manoeuvres a â€œdistractionâ€? for his bid to make B.C. life more affordable, while reiterating his provinceâ€™s belief that its environmental laws can stifle the flow through a federally approved pipeline that happens to be vital to its neighbourâ€™s resource economy. (That last bit ensures Notley canâ€™t rightly view this as a distraction, at least not if she wants to keep her job.)And Notley, awaiting a counter-counterpunch by Horgan, had already told Albertans her government was â€œpreparing further action.â€? What nextâ€”beer? Trade restrictions on B.C. products on headed east on rails to the U.S., via Alberta?So, here we are: two provinces are playing dress-up as feuding sovereign trading partners, embittered nations unto themselves.Itâ€™s a terrible look for a country, to be fraying along its seams even as it tries to sew up multilateral trade deals involving countries on several continents. The trade war hurts Alberta investors in Okanagan wines and B.C. labourers pining for oil conduit jobs, while generally benefiting nobody but wannabe-tough politicians, consultants and media outlets.At least one premier is decidedly not escalating. But with no political upside yet for either premier to back off his or her provocations, and no endgame in sight, somebody has to pursue a way out. That would fall to Confederationâ€™s leaders in the capital.First, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should wrap up in San Francisco and then summon Notley and Horgan to Ottawa. The duelling NDP premiers talked last week after B.C.â€™s declared its anti-bitumen intentions, but not this week as Notley inflicted collateral damage upon unsuspecting pinot growers. These erstwhile political allies arenâ€™t Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, communicating through tweet and state broadcast. But if theyâ€™re only willing to chat via duelling press conference, what third party but a prime minister has the authority to broker a conversation, seek clearer commitments to not drag other economic sectors into the retaliatory quagmire?Second: there are many vague or iffy calls for Ottawa to quash Horganâ€™s plans by asserting its jurisdiction over interprovincial pipelines, but thereâ€™s only so much the Trudeau government can do unless B.C. lays out in regulation or statute how it believes it can get away with constraining pipeline flow. To date, the province has offered little more than some press-release language about the B.C. Environmental Management Act. Notley and Trudeau should pressure Horgan to table or clearly lay out its legal manoeuvreâ€”the B.C. premier said provincial bureaucrats would share their rationale with federal officials this week. And if itâ€™s so important to have such a B.C. restriction in place to protect the coast and land against bitumen spills, why not just impose the regulation already, rather than delay for a year or so with consultations that seem designed to rattle the confidence of Kinder Morgan investors? The National Energy Board last December quashed the City of Burnabyâ€™s attempts to use bylaws to hold up the Trans Mountain expansion; but the agency cannot weigh in on a merely intended delay tactic. The province would have to pass the regulation.â€œI donâ€™t think anyone wants to challenge B.C.â€™s ability to effectively address environmental concerns in its province,â€? says Bruce Ryder, a constitutional expert at Osgoode Hall Law School. â€œTheyâ€™re absolutely right; they can do that. But what theyâ€™ll face a great deal of difficulty in doing is applying any existing or new regulations in a manner that would halt the construction of a federally approved interprovincial infrastructure project.â€? Trudeau and his ministers have thus far been reluctant to declare outright theyâ€™d legally fight B.C.â€™s proposal, which Notley has been demanding; perhaps after federal officials see the proposed action this week, theyâ€™ll be better positioned to squash Horganâ€™s divisive and damaging idea.Lastly, there is room for Ottawa, Alberta and B.C. to address the issue at the heart of this new flareup of the pipeline fight: the fear of uncertainty over bitumen spill science. After numerous studies and continued new findings and new safety measures, if what B.C. wants is yet another review of the literature, perhaps numerous parties can placate that concern now, years before any pipeline construction is actually complete and the Alberta goo starts its journey. As frustrated as Albertans are, they have long lacked much in the way of empathy for the fears in the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island. If this is really what the newest pipeline delay attempt is all about, the Alberta government can put some more cash on the line as a concession to Horgan, and fund yet another review of the research.The â€œifâ€? in this last sentence is the operative word. There are a lot of ifs. If Notley, on a political high right now, wants this political fracas to end and sensible wine trade to resume. If the Trudeau government wants to declare its dominion over projects that squarely fall within its jurisdiction and in the national interest. If the Horgan government isnâ€™t seeking a dubious, backdoor way to relitigate a pipeline decision that somebody else already settled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In response to President Trump's announcement on Friday of a 25% tariff on up to $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, China is threatening to impose new duties on a host of imported U.S. products, including lobsters, starting on July 6.China's plan to impose a tariff on lobster, along with hundreds of other tariffs, is viewed as potentially jeopardizing one of the Maine lobster industry's biggest markets.'This isn't good news at all,' Matt Jacobson, executive director of the Maine Lobster Marketing Collaborative, told the Associated Press in a report published by the Bangor Daily News.'Anything that affects the supply chain is obviously not a great thing,' Kristan Porter, president of the Maine Lobstermen's Association, told the Associated Press.China is an emerging market for U.S. lobster, which has gained popularity with that country's growing middle class.According to the Maine Lobstermen's Community Alliance June 2018 newsletter Landings, 'Possible Chinese tariffs would hurt Alaska and Maine the most due to the volume of seafood trade from those states. 'Not only because China is a crucial current and future market for U.S. fish, but also because there is no ready substitute for the China market,' said John Connelly, president of the National Fisheries Institute during his May testimony to the U.S. trade representative.'The trade war comes at a time when China lobster consumption continues to grow. China imported more than 17.8 million pounds of lobster from the U.S. in 2017, eclipsing the previous record of about 14 million pounds in 2016.The Financial Post reported the value of the imports also surged, from $108.3 million in 2016 to $142.4 million last year, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.It also comes at a time when a new trade agreement between Canada and the European Union, which has cut tariffs on imports of Canadian lobsters, is giving Canada's lobster industry the edge over Maine's. The agreement went into effect last September, phasing out an 8% European tariff on live lobster and frozen and processed Canadian lobster.Maine's congressional delegation â€” Republican Sen. Susan Collins, Independent Sen. Angus King; Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree and Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin â€” issued a joint statement that they intend to press their concerns about China's threatened retaliatory tariffs with federal trade officials.'Maine's lobster industry is an irreplaceable piece of our state's economy that supports thousands of jobs and entire coastal communities,' the delegation said in a statement. 'Just two weeks ago, the Maine delegation heard directly from our state's lobster industry about the economic hardship a trade war with China would cause them.'China and the U.S. are major seafood trading partners beyond just lobster, and the new tariffs would apply to dozens of products that China imports from the U.S., including salmon, tuna and crab, according Fish Information & Services.'This is the biggest market in the world, and to have the U.S. at a disadvantage to every competitor is a big deal,' Jim Gilmore, public affairs director for the Seattle-based At-Sea Processors Association, which represents six companies that catch and process pollock off Alaska, told the seafood industry trade publication.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How trade wars penalize Asian currenciesBy DAN STEINBOCKhome/Opinion/Analysis/How trade wars penalize Asian currenciesNot so long ago, Asian currencies anticipated depreciation pressures to increase, due to monetary normalization. Yet, it is the trade wars that are now penalizing all currencies, particularly in exporting economies.IN January, I gave a global economic briefing on the outlook of the Philippines at the Nordic Chamber of Commerce in Manila. At the time, the peso was still about P50.80 to the US dollar. Among other things, I projected the peso to soften to 54 or more toward the end of the year, which I considered largely the net effect of normalization in advanced economies, elevated trade friction worldwide, as well as fiscal expansion (the Duterte investment program).While skeptics thought the projection was too â€œpessimistic,â€? the peso is today around P53.40 to the US dollar and has occasionally almost exceeded P54.In this view, depreciation pressures are typical to many currencies in emerging Asia, most of which are likely to continue to soften in 2019, including the peso.The onset of trade warsThroughout his 2016 campaign, Donald Trump pledged tougher trade policies. When he arrived in the White House in January 2017, he buried the Transpacific Partnership (TPP), initiated talks about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), suspended the US-EU free trade talks (TTIP) and intensified attacks against Chinese trade and investment.In the global markets, these moves translated to occasional fluctuations, while increasing uncertainty about the global economic outlook.Initially, the US-Chinese Summit in April 2017 seemed to offer some trade relief. Nevertheless, things changed quickly as Trump directed his administration to take a closer look first at Chinese steel and aluminum and later at intellectual property rights and the technology sector â€“ particularly vis-Ã -vis national security.With the most hawkish administration since the Reagan rearmament era, these directives resulted in the kind of reports that were only to be expected in early 2018, when the Trump administration began a steady escalation of the US-Chinese trade war, starting in March. Last week, the White House made the â€œlargest trade war in historyâ€? official, while starting to escalate trade friction with Europe.Unsurprisingly, almost all Asian currencies are now taking hits not just from expected directions (rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, the anticipated end of the European Central Bankâ€™s quantitative easing), but also from more less-expected directions (US-Chinese trade war, the nascent US-EU trade war, and escalating rhetoric among the NAFTA partners â€“ US, Canada and Mexico).Impact on Asian currenciesIn Asia, the net effect has been as projected half a year ago. Among high-income economies, export-led currencies â€“ Korean won (KRW, -5.1 percent), Taiwanese dollar (TWD, -2.7 percent) and Singaporean dollar (SGD, -2.3 percent) â€“ have weakened relatively most against the US dollar.ASIAN CURRENCIES: 2018 YEAR-TO-DATE PERCENT CHANGEThe same goes for the currencies of upper-middle income economies, including Chinese yuan (CNY, -1.5 percent) and Thai baht (, THB, -1.4 percent).Among lower-middle income economies, it is those currencies that represent the relatively fastest-growing countries â€“ Indian rupee (INR, -7.5 percent), Philippines peso (PHP, -7.4 percent) and Indonesian rupiah (IDR, -5.0 percent) â€“ that have weakened relatively most against the US dollar. Since these currencies also represent twin-deficit economies, they will remain relatively vulnerable in adverse scenarios (Figure).Nevertheless, these twin deficits should not be compared with that of, say, the US. Unlike advanced economies that take more debt to sustain unsustainable living standards, rapidly growing emerging economies seek to exploit twin deficits in the medium term to accelerate economic growth in the long term. Yet, twin deficits come with exposure that should keep government leaders alert.In the early phases of the trade wars, those countriesâ€”Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia, Korea, and Malaysiaâ€” that export relatively more to China than to the US tend to be better positioned. The reverse case implies greater relative vulnerabilities, which is why Vietnam has resumed the depreciation of its dong.Other Asian countries try to avoid U.S. trade wrath by fostering strategic ties with the White House (Taiwan, Korea). Still others seek to hedge their bets by seeking greater balance between Chinese economic cooperation and US security ties (Philippines, Malaysia).The worse is still aheadIt is a highly dynamic landscape. Among the high-income countries, the Trump administration has offered Seoul strategic relief from the trade war, thanks to Seoulâ€™s cooperation in the Koreasâ€™ nuclear talks, which will provide some cushion against wonâ€™s further weakening, in the short term.Among the upper-middle-income countries, the Chinese central bank (PBOC) pledged last week it would keep the exchange rate stable, which put something of a damper on dollar increases. Since China accounts for more than a fifth of the Federal Reserveâ€™s trade-weighted dollar index, more than any other country, it can subdue dollar rallies.Among the lower-middle-income economies, those countries that have strong domestic demand (India, Philippines) are relatively more insulated from trade wars than commodity producers (Indonesia) and exporters (Vietnam). In the long run, there is no safe haven from the trade wars, however.Here are some unsettling scenarios for the coming months: If the trade war between the US and China will continue to worsen, it could penalize both US and Chinese GDP by 0.25 percent by yearend.If similar trade war expands between the US and Europe, the implications will be worse for the US but weaken Germany, France and other EU core economies and thus undermine the fragile European recovery.If comparable trade friction will extend to Japan, which, despite huge monetary injections by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), has already lost two decades amid secular stagnation, the adverse impact could harm global economic prospects.If the NAFTA talks were to collapse, the US economy would take still another hit, but so would both Canada and Mexico, which could compel them to broaden their ties with Asian economies.In brief, the elements of a perfect storm are now possible, if not probable yet, especially if the adverse trends will converge. Even in an incremental scenarioâ€”one that would mean continued but not disruptive deteriorationâ€”economic damage would prove far more substantial in 2019, or worse.How the major economies will respond to trade war escalation in the coming weeks will determine whatâ€™s ahead for all of us in the next few years.Dan Steinbock is the founder of Difference Group and has served as research director of international business at the India, China and America Institute (US) and a visiting fellow at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies (China) and the EU Center (Singapore).

"World politics is a never-ending drama with Trump as President of the United States. From the G7 bust-up to the North Korea negotiations, he never fails to create waves. Now Trump is preparing a full-scale trade war with China, with potentially devastating consequences for the world economy.Trumpâ€™s first batch of tariffs has now been announced, meaning that Chinese exports worth $46bn in 2017 will face 25 percent tariffs. The list was immediately followed by an announcement from the Chinese government that it would retaliate with 25 percent tariffs on $45bn worth of products, two-thirds of which will come into effect on 6 July.The reaction to these tariffs has been markedly different compared to that towards tariffs levelled against Europe. The Europeans, unsurprisingly, are far less worried about tariffs on the Chinese than on themselves. Similarly, the US ruling class (via its press), which was hostile to the tariffs on the G7 countries, is more sanguine about the tariffs on China.As we explained in March, the US ruling class (as well as that of Europe and Japan) is worried about China developing new, high-tech production. Theyâ€™re particularly worried about Chinese state aid to high-tech sectors. The fear is that China will be able to compete in industries where the advanced capitalist countries have had an advantage up until now. Itâ€™s one thing for the Chinese to produce cheap, labour-intensive products, or assemble components that were produced elsewhere; itâ€™s another for them to produce high-tech components and machinery.Ruling class hypocrisyThe G7 countries that are voicing concern over this are of course completely hypocritical. Most of them developed their industries with a lot of state support, and they continue to do so. Take Tesla, for example, which has received $3-4bn in state subsidies (depending on how you count) according to Good Jobs First. Boeing, another important company, has managed to rack up $14bn in subsidies, plus an additional $74bn in loans. The EU managed to get a WTO ruling against its Airbus subsidies last month, where $22bn of its subsidies in 2004 (WTO rulings are a slow process) were deemed contrary to WTO rules. There are many other subsidies that are not counted, such as government contracts, spending on research in universities and so on.The other accusation levelled against the Chinese is that they donâ€™t respect intellectual property. Itâ€™s impossible to know the exact level of intellectual property theft by Chinese companies but given that theyâ€™re starting from a lower technological position, they probably are stealing more than others. Wikileaks showed how the US was conducting massive espionage against its allies with the aim of giving companies like Boeing a competitive edge. So, the US knows how itâ€™s done.Many of the concerns raised by G7 countries against China hypocritically overlook the 'anti-competitive' ways they built their own economies / Image: Flickr, White HouseOne not so well-known benefit Britain derived from its empire in the 19th century was the ability to acquire the most advanced technology from other parts of the world and put it to work on an industrial scale. The British borrowed technology from other parts of the world, undoubtedly without paying a penny in royalties. Similarly, multinational agri-businesses have been stealing seeds from farmers in the recent period.Of course, when the Chinese do it, itâ€™s theft, when the West does it, itâ€™s business. Rather than sharing out the wealth of human progress with the Chinese, the imperialist powers would like to keep their competitive edge and force the Chinese to work with yesterdayâ€™s technologies. In fact, the US has a number of restrictions on exporting technology to China. So, this is not really a question of right or wrong, but an attempt to keep the Chinese capitalists from producing products that require the most advanced technology.The Europeans have for some time been quite keen to work with the US on this question. This is one of the reasons the US bourgeoisie is annoyed with Trump. It would be far easier to bring the Chinese to heel if the G7 countries could present a united front against China. Trumpâ€™s spat with the main US allies makes that impossible. Now the US will have to attempt to deal with the Chinese on its own.Disagreements within US bourgeoisieThere has been criticism of Trumpâ€™s policy in US ruling circles, but itâ€™s mainly in the realm of how Trump is fighting the trade war, rather than the fact he is fighting it. A section wants to push even harder than Trump. The Senate has just passed a bill attempting to block Trumpâ€™s deal with ZTE (the Chinese mobile manufacturer that supposedly broke Iran sanctions) and mentions Huawei (Chinese telecoms giant) as a national security threat. The bill passed 85 votes to 10.Trumpâ€™s personal grudge doesnâ€™t seem to be so much intellectual property and high-tech industries. Rather, he is concerned with the trade deficit. This is not much of a concern to the US bourgeoisie, which is benefitting immensely from cheap labour in China. 43 percent of Chinese exports are by foreign-owned firms, concentrated in computers and other electronics. Appleâ€™s super-profits would be severely cut if it had to pay US wages instead of the Chinese rate to make its electronics, for example. The trade deficit, if anything, is a good thing for the US bourgeoisie.The Senate has just passed a bill attempting to block Trumpâ€™s deal to rescue ZTE / Image: K?rlis Dambr?nsThis is also reflected in the types of goods that are affected by the tariffs. The big multinational companies were very worried that the tariffs were going to cause problems for them and lobbied hard to stop the tariffs affecting consumer goods. The Peterson Institute for International Economics crunched the numbers and found that the original draft proposal of goods to be affected by tariffs included 12 percent consumer goods, but the list released on 15 June only had 1 percent. Instead of consumer goods, intermediary goods like semiconductors (a key component in all electronics) and plastics were added to the list. Trump stated that the tariffs will target goods that â€œcontain industrially significant technologiesâ€?.Although the big, US multinationals have saved themselves from the worst of the tariffs, theyâ€™re likely to be affected by Chinese retaliation. China has retaliated with tariffs on agricultural products, chemicals, oil, coal, and cars. This is partly targeted towards Republican-supporting areas, but it is also a reflection of Chinaâ€™s relatively weak position when it comes to a potential tariff war. Much of the remaining goods are precisely those parts that China is unable to produce at the moment, and where the US is at an advantage. Retaliation is therefore probably going to be restricted to bureaucratic obstacles for US companies. Qualcomm, for example, is trying to purchase a Dutch Semiconductor producer NXP, and the Chinese could stop the transaction, particularly if the Senate manages to block a deal on ZTE.On their own, the tariffs proposed ($50bn) arenâ€™t a disaster to the world economy. However, a number of commentators, although generally in favour of putting pressure on China, are worried about the broader effects the tariffs might create. As George Magnus, the former Chief Economist at UBS put it:'The economic and political consequences of a trade war are more corrosive than simple maths suggest, and escalation will undermine business confidence and raise prices and job losses.'Trumpâ€™s disruptive trade â€˜diplomacyâ€™At the moment, the tariffs havenâ€™t been implemented. There is some scope for negotiations but itâ€™s unlikely that the two sides will reach any kind of deal in the near future. More likely, the present measures will be followed by a further escalation of tension as Trump starts drawing up another list of $200bn worth of goods to tax. This will inevitably hit major US multinational companies that assemble or produce goods in China and it will serve to make consumer goods more expensive. The Chinese will have to respond, but with administrative measures, and possibly by currency devaluation. If such an escalation takes place, it would have serious consequences for the world economy.Protectionist tensions reflect contradictions between the main imperialist powers arising out of the crisis of world capitalism / Image: Flickr, NATOTrump is attempting to readjust the USâ€™s trading relations with the rest of the world, at the expense of the rest of the world. Using the economic might of the US, heâ€™s attempting to force concessions from his trading partners. At least in part, heâ€™s supported by the US ruling class. This is having a tremendously disruptive effect on world relations. Itâ€™s upsetting long-established alliances and escalating tensions elsewhere. The IMF declared politics as the biggest risk to the world economy in 2018. They werenâ€™t far off the mark.In the past this would have led to war; but nuclear weapons, the strength of the working class and the overwhelming military might of the US, mean that an open, armed conflict between the major powers is ruled out. Instead, they will have to resort to other forms of conflict, such as proxy wars, but also economic warfare, which is what the Trump is attempting to wage on the Chinese.These protectionist tensions reflect contradictions between the main imperialist powers arising out of the crisis of world capitalism. The crisis sharpens competition over market shares between the imperialist powers. At the same time, it also sharpens the social contradictions within these nations as austerity bites. The latter also leads to a destabilising of the political regime, with the ruling class unable to control its own representatives in government. Trump, Brexit and the recent Italian elections are all examples of this. The consequence is a vicious circle, which the bourgeois will find very difficult to break.Trump is a protectionist but his actions only reflect greater historical forces at play. He is both a result of the end of the post-war trade consensus and another nail in its coffin. In reality, his liberal opponents have no alternative to his policies. In fact, they seem inclined to cheer him on half the time. In the end, they only reflect the impasse of an economic system that should have been overthrown a long time ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Two weeks ago, Trump announced tariffs on another $200bn worth of imports from China. The announcement was met with protests from the Chinese, as well as big business in the US. China responded with tariffs on another $60bn of imports from the US. This trade war reveals the frictions that have been developing for some time between the imperialist powers, and threatens to plunge the world into a new recession.Against globalisationTrump is one of the most narrow-minded and isolationist presidents the US has had for a long time. His capacity to understand international trade and the world economy is limited to that of a construction magnate. He is only interested in driving hard bargains. He and his supporters think the US is hard done by and has been taken advantage of. Trumpâ€™s solution (to threaten and bluff until he gets his way) is like a businessman pressing for a better deal from a competitor.Trump's capacity to understand international trade and the world economy is limited to that of a construction magnate. He is only interested in driving hard bargains / Image: Flickr, Gage SkidmoreThis completely overturns all the norms of how to conduct international diplomacy. It also threatens US domination â€“ a world order where the US calls the shots but where all the main imperialist powers get a chance to benefit. If the US is now attempting to use its military and economic strength to bully other powers into signing less-favourable trade agreements, it undermines the whole of the post-WWII order and world trade (also known as globalisation). This is why the North American, Japanese and European bourgeois have been strenuously opposing Trumpâ€™s approach. It could have disastrous long-term consequences for trade on a global scale.It seems that for the moment, this conflict has abated. A temporary agreement was reached between the US, EU and Canada, while Mexico and the US have just negotiated a new NAFTA (rebranded USMCA). Trump is also in discussions with the Japanese. Yet, even if agreements are reached, long-term damage has been done to confidence and trust in the US commitment to tariff-free trade. The various open trade disputes over the past several months have led IMF chief Christine Lagarde to warn that trade barriers are â€œhurting not only trade itself, but also investment and manufacturing as uncertainty continues to riseâ€?.Focus on ChinaThe agreement with Canada has raised hopes among the US ruling class that Trump will return to TPP negotiations, from which Trump pulled out. Many of the clauses in the new USMCA are very similar to those in the TPP. Wall Street Journal columnist, Aaron back, put it as follows:â€œThe U.S. should now follow this template with its Asia-Pacific trading partners, to revive the dream of building a new, rules-based trading bloc to counter China.â€?Indeed, the focus in world trade and international relations has shifted firmly to the trade war between the US and China. Unlike the various conflicts Trump started with US allies, he is cheered on in his dispute with China by the US bourgeois.To be more precise, there are two separate conflicts that are being fought at the same time. Trump is attempting to close the massive gap between what the US imports from China and what China imports from the US. This conflict is difficult to resolve, particularly in the short run, but the Chinese government wouldnâ€™t necessarily be completely opposed to some measures in that direction. In fact, it lies generally along the road China intends to travel anyway: of reducing its industryâ€™s reliance on exports.Moving up the food chainChinese efforts to develop more high-tech sectors of industry is the more difficult issue to resolve. The US â€“ as well as Europe and Japan â€“ are accusing China of stealing technology and forcing companies to transfer technology to Chinese companies. This is not a new development. Every country that has developed technologically has done so on the back of technology from other countries. Why reinvent the wheel? The Chinese might do so using methods that are frowned upon by others, but fundamentally they have all done the same thing at some point or another.China wants to capture the markets for the high-tech components used in electronics / Image: Steve JurvetsonThe question isnâ€™t really how China is doing it but that it is doing it. Chinese production of electronics uses semi-skilled labour and parts produced in other countries. Most components, as well as machinery, are sourced from Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, the US and even Europe. The result is that although iPhones are nominally manufactured in China, in reality only a very small part of the production process is located there.According to a study by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, only 0.3 percent of the iPhone 7â€™s components (by value) are produced in China, compared to 29 percent in the US and 29 percent in Taiwan. For the Samsung Galaxy S7, the figures are 45 percent of component value from US and 29 percent from South Korea. The Chinese Huawei P9 by contrast included 32 percent of Chinese components. Given that the final assembly (in China) only represents 1 percent of total value contained in the product, and components 10 percent, this leaves the US and Taiwanese manufacturing with a contribution of 30 percent each of the total price of the iPhone, but obviously much higher for the P9.What China is attempting to do is enter higher up the supply chain and capture the markets for the high-tech components used in electronics. At the moment Chinese companies and production facilities are incapable of delivering the quality that other countries can. For this reason, semiconductors constitute one of the key parts of the â€˜Made in China 2025â€™ plan, which puts China in direct competition with the US and its companies. This is something the US, the EU and Japan are determined to stop, or at the very least slow down.Competing with the USThe Wall Street Journal wrote the following in an editorial statement:â€œIf China were a small country, the U.S. could afford to absorb surplus goods and let American consumers benefit. Chinaâ€™s effort to leapfrog into the ranks of developed economies by forcing companies to relocate their most valuable processes and pervert the law of comparative advantage will ultimately fail. â€œBut when the worldâ€™s second-largest economy goes rogue, the collateral damage is huge and has undermined political support in the U.S. and the West for free trade. More ominously, Chinaâ€™s mercantilism is part of a larger Xi Jinping strategy to establish a new military and commercial hegemony in Asia.â€?Basically, the WSJ is objecting to China becoming another power to compete with existing ones. Theyâ€™d much prefer if China stuck to its traditional role of assembly and manufacture of more low-tech goods.The same sentiment is echoed in the Financial Times:â€œUnlike Mr Trumpâ€™s complaints against other economies, including the EU and the USâ€™s Nafta partners, Mexico and Canada, much of his criticism against Beijing is warranted. China has swerved significantly off the glide path to becoming a market economy that the rest of the membership of the World Trade Organization believed the country would follow after it joined the body in 2001. â€œThe â€˜Made in China 2025â€™ initiative, which aims to establish a global lead in high-technology sectors, has given central and local governments and state-owned enterprises even more licence to intervene. They are distorting markets with protectionist regulation and stealing technology from foreign companies operating in the country.â€?The American and European bourgeoisie would much prefer if China stuck to its traditional role of assembly and manufacture of more low-tech goods / Image: K?rlis Dambr?nsThe FT and the WSJ claim itâ€™s unfair competition, but all countries (except perhaps England and Holland) at various times used significant state-directed investment in order to develop their industries. They also used tariffs to protect themselves against more competitive, established powers.China is attempting to follow the same path, but itâ€™s doubtful whether it will be successful. At the beginning of the crisis, all the European and US economists were calling for precisely this. They were arguing that China must raise its wages, it must develop more of an internal market, rely less on exports etc. This is fully in line with the plans of the Chinese government, but it has certain consequences.Powder kegsThe Chinese regime has emerged from the 2000s with a profound sense of confidence in its own system, but it is tremendously worried about labour unrest. The recent decades of economic development have created a massive proletariat, concentrated in enormous industrial centres. Some of these urban centres have a GDP per capita almost as high as that of Spain (for example, Guangzhou and Shenzhen), but with wage levels significantly lower ($13,000 versus $18,000). The state has already intervened to push wages higher but it risks removing one of the major factors pushing Chinese economic development to this point: a cheap, but comparatively well-educated, labour force.In order to raise wages, China has to produce products that add more value, in order to remain competitive. They have to produce more high-tech products, requiring more skilled workers. These are the only means by which they will be able to move from low wages and low labour productivity to higher wages and higher productivity.If China were to accept putting a limit on its development of new technologies, it risks creating an economic, social and political crisis on a level that would dwarf Tiananmen / Image: The White HouseThe main problem standing in Chinaâ€™s way is the economic crisis. The Chinese economy is slowing its rate of development from 14 percent in 2007 to 6.9 percent in 2017. The vast credit binge that the government has promoted has almost doubled total debt (private and government) in the same 10 years, from 145 percent of GDP to 256 percent. Now analysts are speculating on a further loosening of credit in response to the tariffs. This is unsustainable. Trump and the US bourgeois are hoping that the economic difficulties that China is undergoing will make them more susceptible to pressure. This remains to be seen.If China were to accept putting a limit on its development of new technologies, it risks creating an economic, social and political crisis on a level that would dwarf Tiananmen. The heavy-handed way in which it reacted to the Uyghur protests, as well as clampdown on labour movement activists, gives an indication of a regime that is very nervous about the risk of protests becoming generalised.The US bourgeois, of course, is in precisely the same predicament. The support for Bernie Sanders and the election of Trump were clear indications that the workers in the US have had enough. The US ruling class is, therefore, attempting to cling on to those markets where it, along with its allies, is currently dominating. It is not prepared, in these conditions, to allow the development of a rival on the scale of China. This is why both Democrats and Republicans, as well as the European bourgeois, are uniting behind Trump on this question.A threat to national securityItâ€™s not just a question of pure economics either. On multiple occasions, the US has raised concerns about the Chinese security services using Chinese-produced electronics to spy on the US. Both Huawei and ZTE have been banned from selling certain types of telecom equipment to the US for that reason. Of course, the US know all about this, as they have been spying on everyone else over the past 20-30 years using precisely such methods. So, the US is concerned (and they are probably correct), that another nation will develop the kind of spying capabilities that it currently possesses.Similarly, Chinese military expansion is threatening US domination of the seas. Itâ€™s not by accident that renewed trade tension has caused new friction over the South China Sea, with the US provocatively sailing close to new Chinese military installations. The US calls them â€œfreedom of navigationâ€? missions, which means the freedom of the US Navy to patrol any sea it wishes.The new aircraft carrier that China has launched, as well as new missiles, are putting a big question mark over US domination of this crucial trade route. It raises the prospect of China dominating this sea, which carries 1/3 of global maritime trade. Developing more advanced consumer technology would also help China produce the more sophisticated equipment required for modern aircraft carriers and missiles.No end in sightThe relationship between the US and China has been deteriorating for some time. Obama attempted to extricate himself from the Middle East in order to â€œpivot to East Asiaâ€?. He began a series of trade negotiations with allies in the Pacific aimed at isolating China and strengthening trade with the other countries in the region. The Trans-Pacific Partnership was a crucial part of that.Trump came into his presidency like a bull in a china shop and wrecked a lot of the Obama administrationâ€™s diplomatic plans in the region. He broke off the TPP and imposed tariffs on a number of key allies in the region. At first, he also appeared to only take an interest in the question of the trade deficit, which is a secondary consideration from the standpoint of the US ruling class. Over the past 3-4 months, he has shifted to align himself more clearly with the rest of the US establishment. The NAFTA 2.0 deal was a clear indication of that. This means that the US ruling class has found at least a temporary unity of purpose.Trump came into his presidency like a bull in a china shop and wrecked a lot of the Obama administrationâ€™s diplomatic plans in East Asia / Image: Flickr, Gage SkidmoreThis strengthens Trumpâ€™s hand. He can now face the Chinese with a Congress more-or-less united behind him. This means that it is unlikely he will be forced to back down from domestic pressure. At the same time, what the US is proposing is impossible for the Chinese to accept. They will not abandon their attempts to move into new technologies, neither will they accept large-scale privatisation of key State-Owned Enterprises.Zhang Xiangchen, Chinaâ€™s representative to the WTO said in July that China is a â€œsocialist market economyâ€? and that any speculation about China changing its path was â€œwishful thinkingâ€?. When he says â€œsocialistâ€?, of course, he merely refers to state influence and direction: a necessary prerequisite for Chinaâ€™s economic development. The key point that Zhang makes is that China will not abandon its state direction of, and intervention in, the economy.The seriousness of the conflict has escalated to the point that there is open speculation about the US attempting to break away China from its supply chains, creating the possibility of companies operating multiple supply chains: one for the US and one for the rest of the world.A new normalSome kind of agreement is not excluded in the short run. Apparently, President Trump is hoping to discuss with President Xi in November at the G20 summit. This agreement would have a temporary character. The conflict between China and the US will only intensify over the coming period, particularly when the next recession comes.Trade wars were once excluded from the arsenal of weapons in international conflict. Trump has firmly redeployed them / Image: Flickr, NATOAs far as trade wars are concerned, the genie is clearly out of the bottle. For a whole period, trade wars were excluded from the arsenal of weapons in international conflict. Trump has brought them back to the table. Saudi Arabia blocked trade with Canada in a recent conflict over a tweet by the Canadian Foreign Minister. Trump attempted to force Erdogan to release a US pastor by sinking the Turkish economy.As we reach the end of the first decade after the crisis, protectionism is rearing its head very prominently. For the first 10 years, the bourgeoisie fought hard to stop it coming back. One of the reasons that the 1930s crisis became a recession was precisely a turn to protectionism. No one knows exactly what consequences a reversal of the past decades of very low tariffs on trade will have on the world economy. For many years the bourgeois insisted it would be a disaster. Now they are hoping it might not be as bad as they feared.With the prospect of a new recession, they ought to be worried. Any lingering tensions of this nature (when there is supposed to be a recovery) are bound to explode into an even bigger conflict when the next recession hits. There is a new normal in international relations, and it will only serve to intensify future economic crises.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Trump administrationâ€™s trade wars will soon begin redirecting tons of fresh food meant for overseas markets to Americaâ€™s poor â€” if local providers can handle it.Tariff fights between the United States and its trading partners are making food intended for foreign markets too expensive overseas, so the administration is bailing out domestic farmers by buying their products and making them available nationwide to emergency food distributors.That will mean up to 350,000 pounds of additional food, much of it fresh meats, vegetables and fruit, for the Second Harvest Food Bank of the Lehigh Valley and Northeast Pennsylvania â€” just in the first phase of a four-phase program, Director Jessica Dokachev said.To be determined, however, is whether the food bank and all the other points in the supply chain, including distributors and food pantries â€” where the poor ultimately pick up the goods â€” have sufficient dry and cold storage space for the influx.â€œCapacity is so much of an issue,â€? Dokachev said.Since the U.S. Department of Agriculture began notifying agencies of the move about a month ago, distribution agencies have had virtually no time to build infrastructure and capacity for the â€œbonusâ€? food, which is expected to flow to warehouses at the end of this month, she said.According to the USDA, the administration last month began a $12 billion â€œtrade aidâ€? bailout program for American farmers who may be hurt by Chinese tariffs, which were imposed in retaliation for U.S. trade actions. The largest chunk of that funding will go directly to farmers of soybeans, corn, cotton, sorghum, wheat, hogs and dairy who are most affected by the trade retaliation, the USDA said.Also as part of the bailout, however, is $1.2 billion to buy food and distribute it through child nutrition and emergency food assistance programs, USDA said.That means Second Harvest, which normally gets about 700,000 pounds of food a year through the USDAâ€™s Emergency Food Assistance Program, will get 1 million pounds or more, Dokachev said. Much of it will be â€œmilk, produce and high-quality protein products â€” pork, chicken and beef,â€? she said.According to the USDA, more than $550 million of the bonus commodities will be pork. Apples, pistachios and dairy products also will be widely available.Second Harvest is in a good position to handle the extra food. Three years ago, it moved into larger quarters in East Allen Township with four times the cold storage capacity it used to have, according to Dokachev. It also has three refrigerated trucks, including one that replaced a truck stolen late last year, she said.Other agencies could face the difficult decision of possibly turning down food because the bonus federal funding cannot be used for administrative costs or infrastructure, Dokachev said.The extra food would be welcome by some Lehigh Valley food pantries where produce is in especially high demand.David Wickmann, a volunteer at the Central Moravian Church in Bethlehem, said more food is always appreciated, and the food pantry has space in its refrigerator and freezer to store more items.Clients devour fresh produce, Wickmann said. And milk in particular would be a boon for the food pantry, which feeds about 110 families a month.â€œIâ€™ve tried to get milk now for some time and have not been able to, so if we had that, that would be an exceptional gift really,â€? he said.Diane Elliott, executive director of New Bethlehem Ministries in Bethlehem, said the organization would request an additional allotment from Second Harvest if the regionwide organization receives more food.The organization, which serves about 280 households a month, is moving soon into a space with an expanded food pantry that will allow it to refrigerate more food and offer clients more choice.â€œObviously, we would love to have access to additional produce as we expand our reach,â€? she said in an email.There are still many unknowns about the program. Shannon Powers, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Agriculture, said itâ€™s uncertain exactly how much food Pennsylvania would get.Itâ€™s also unclear how to transport, store and distribute all the additional food.â€œWe hope theyâ€™ll identify some funding to help â€¦ because we donâ€™t have [money] set aside,â€? she said.Regardless, she said, the state will make it work.Dokachev expects the first phase of the program to last until April. Regulations for the remainder of the bonus program, which she said would last for two years, have yet to be determined.Tariffs on domestic foods were imposed not only by China, but also by partners such as Canada, Mexico and the European Union, the Congressional Research Service said. The tariffs, imposed on 800 agricultural items and food products, had an export value of $27 billion in 2017, it said.tdarragh@mcall.comTwitter @tmdarragh610-820-6691",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Asian countries have voiced concern about the potentially devastating impact of a US-China trade war, with ministers calling for the acceleration of talks for a gigantic Beijing-backed free-trade deal that excludes the United States. Fear that a simmering trade spat between the world's top two economies could spiral into a full-blown trade war -- with painful consequences for China's neighbours -- was among topics dominating discussion at a regional summit in Singapore on Saturday. Tit-for-tat tariffs have fuelled months of tensions that were notched up Friday as Beijing threatened to impose levies on $60 billion of American goods, from beef to condoms. The measures, which the White House ridiculed as 'weak' but China said were 'fully justified', came after Washington said it would increase the rate of additional tariffs on Chinese goods worth $200 billion. The prospect of a trade war is a 'real threat' to Asian countries, Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah told reporters Saturday on the sidelines of the summit. 'The threat is making many countries very concerned and... is becoming more complex,' he said. Other top Asian diplomats at Saturday's forum, hosted by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), spoke out against protectionism, warning that it places the region's development in jeopardy. 'Rising anti-globalisation and trade protectionism among major countries is fuelling tensions and threatening our aspirations for sustained economic growth,' said South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha. Countries in the region must 'explore creative ways to further deepen and broaden our cooperation', in the face of such challenges, she said. Some ministers have called for the early conclusion of talks for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a 16-nation pact poised to become the world's largest free-trade agreement, covering about half the global population. The planned RCEP deal would group the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. - 'Protectionism on the rise' â€“ But it would not include the United States, which had been leading another regional trade pact -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) -- until US President Donald Trump abruptly abandoned it last year. Even with the lure to access to the world's largest economy withdrawn, the eleven remaining TPP countries, who make up 13.5 percent of the global economy, signed a slimmed-down version of the pact in March. It cuts tariffs and requires members to comply with a high level of regulatory standards in areas like labour law and environmental protection. RCEP also aims to cut tariffs but has far less regulatory standards attached than TPP. Nonetheless, Washington's abandonment of TPP has given the RCEP negotiations a fresh shot in the arm. 'Given the current global situation where protectionism is on the rise, Japan would like to achieve a swift conclusion of our RCEP negotiations,' Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said. Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said he hoped the RCEP pact would be complete by the end of the year, while Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan urged countries facing 'headwinds against free trade' to rally together. The US imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods in early July, sparking retaliatory measures from China. Days later, Washington unveiled a list of another $200 billion in Chinese goods from electrical machinery to seafood that would be hit with 10 percent import duties. Trump upped the ante this week by threatening to lift the tariff rate to 25 percent. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the US position and hit back at China. 'President Trump inherited an unfair trade regime where American workers and American companies were not treated reciprocally by the Chinese,' he said Saturday. 'Efforts of the Trump administration are to right that, to correct it, to adjust that.' AFP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The LyondellBasell Morris Complex on Saturday, April 7. The complex manufactured polyethylene, among other products, which is on the list of chemicals potentially targeted by Chinese tariffs. As Grundy County farmers prepare their fields for the season, where their products may go after harvest is up in the air, as China threatens to place tariff's on corn and soybeans, among other products.MORRIS â€“ As China and the U.S. set and exchange threats of tariffs, it turns out farmers and manufacturers in Grundy County could be caught in the middle of the potential trade war.When China announced a list of 106 U.S. products that would be subject to the tariff, it included a number of items familiar to many in Grundy County: soy beans, corn, cornflour and several types of chemical products that are either manufactured at area facilities, or the area facilities are part of the supply chain.Victoria Wax, manager at the Grundy County Farm Bureau, said farmers are going to be hit hard.â€œWhen your looking at costs increasing, thatâ€™s going to cut into profits theyâ€™re making,â€? Wax said. Adding to the problems, 2018 is forecasting to be yet another down year for crops and commodities prices. Wax said it is looking to be the fifth-straight year of declining farm income.Soybeans are big business in Grundy County. In 2017, 96,000 acres of soybeans were planted, yielding 5,485,000 bushels of soybeans. Even in a down year, that equals tens of millions of dollars in income.About 30 percent of soybeans grown in the U.S. are exported to China, Wax said. And while the demand from China means they will always have to export some of the U.S.â€™ crop, she said higher prices means they could also look to places like South America for less expensive products.On April 4, China announced the American products that would now be subject to tariffs when entering China. Tariffs are taxes or duties imposed on imports or exports by a country. Tariffs often will increase the cost of a product, and can be used to control imports or protect a countryâ€™s native industry.The Chinese tariffs were a response to threat made by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on Chinese products entering the United States. The tit-for-tat exchange has created fears of a trade war between to worldâ€™s two largest economies. The two nations are also some of each others largest trading partners.The list of products impacted by Chinaâ€™s tariffs include numerous agriculture products, not just the corn and soybeans. Dried cranberries are on the list, along with wheat and sorghum, frozen meat, orange juice and various types of tobacco. Because the list is so varied, it could impact Grundy County farmers in various ways.â€œIt will be kind of a chain reaction,â€? Wax said. For example, if Chinese consumers purchase less American meat, then fewer American livestock will need to be fed corn and soybeans.â€œThis is a real concern to our membership,â€? Wax said.In response, the farm bureau is encouraging its members to contact legislators and voice their concerns.Industrial ImpactItâ€™s not just agriculture that can be hit. Automobiles, aircraft and more than a dozen different chemicals are also included on the list.Polyethylene is one of them, and it is one of the products manufactured at the LyondellBasell Morris Complex. The complex is one of the largest employers in Grundy County, with more than 300 employees, according to Grundy County Economic Development. LyondellBasellâ€™s publications say it contributes more than $300 million into the local economy.The company did not respond to a request comment, but it is represented by the American Chemistry Council, a group that represents more than 160 chemical companies across the nation. In a letter released by Cal Dooley, president and chief executive officer of the ACC, it said that chemical manufacturers support free trade, and that the tariffs are in large part targeted towards chemicals.â€œChina is one of the U.S. chemical industryâ€™s most important trading partners, importing 11 percent, or $3.2 billion, of all U.S. plastic resins in 2017,â€? Dooleyâ€™s letter reads. â€œWe are particularly concerned that 40 percent of the products to which China has assigned new tariffs are chemicals, including polyethylene, PVC, polycarbonates, acrylates, and others.â€?Dooley urged the two countries to reach and agreement before the tariffs are implemented.China appears to have cooled its rhetoric, with President Xi Jingping saying in a speech on Tuesday that he would like to work to open Chinaâ€™s economy, with the stock market responding positively to the results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Â© CBC Jack Liu, president of North American operations for Zoneco, a large Chinese seafood company with a plant in Eastern Passage, N.S., says the tariff wars between the United States and China has had a negative effect on Canadian lobster exporters.The United States-China trade war is creating choppy seas for Canada's lobster exporters.It has led to the dumping of Maine lobster â€” now priced out of China â€” in other Asian markets and Europe, said Jack Liu, president of North American operations for Zoneco, a large Chinese seafood company with a Nova Scotia operation.Dumping is when a country or company exports a product in a foreign market at a price that is lower than the price in the exporter's domestic market.'All of a sudden they lost the Chinese market due to the 25 per cent tariff and what are they going to do? They are going to dump those amount of lobster into other parts of the world market. We have seen that,' said Liu.He cites Hong Kong, Malaysia and Taiwan as Asian markets where lobster from the U.S. is now selling at least $1 US cheaper, putting pressure on sales of Canadian lobster.'I believe Canadian lobster, as we speak, is somewhat losing market share in those Asian markets due to the lower price from the U.S.'Â© CBC Capital Seafoods, located in Eastern Passage, N.S., has increased its lobster-hold capacity with the help of a repayable $400,000 loan from Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.On the upside, he said the demand for Canadian lobster in China has gone up in the short term, but he does not welcome it.'Tariffs have never been a good thing. Any sort of tariffs are going to distort and disrupt the markets and we've already seen that,' he said, referring to the dumping underway.Liu had hoped the U.S.- China dispute would be short-lived, but he now fears it might last longer.Still the uncertainty has not slowed Zoneco's ambitious expansion plans in Nova Scotia.In 2014, it became the first Chinese company to enter the Nova Scotia lobster industry when it bought up the Capital Seafoods lobster pound in Eastern Passage outside Halifax.New equipment will remove lobster meat from shellOn Friday, the company announced it plans to add 50,000 pounds of live lobster-holding capacity in Eastern Passage, helped by a $400,000 repayable contribution from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.'It's part of a long-term strategy, a long-term plan,' said Liu.After construction is completed in March 2019, Liu said Capital will move on to an even bigger expansion, installing processing equipment capable of removing a lobster entirely from its shell.Capital Seafood said it has spent $7 million in Nova Scotia since its arrival.Several other Chinese companies have also since set up operations in the province.Read more stories at CBC Nova Scotia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"U.S. President Donald Trump fired the biggest shot yet in the global trade war by imposing tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports. China retaliated.Duties on Chinese goods started at 12:01 a.m. Friday in Washington, just after midday in China. Another $16 billion of goods could follow in two weeks, Trump earlier told reporters, before suggesting the final total could eventually reach $550 billion, a figure that exceeds all of U.S. goods imports from China in 2017.U.S. customs officials will begin collecting an additional 25 percent tariff on imports from China of goods ranging from farming plows to semiconductors and airplane parts. China has said it would respond by imposing higher levies on an equivalent amount of goods ranging from American soybeans to automobiles, which may in turn prompt Trump to raise trade barriers even higher.Chinaâ€™s tariff actions in response took effect at 12:01 p.m. in Beijing, state news agency Xinhua reported, citing an unidentified official from the General Administration of Customs.â€œThe United States has violated WTO rules and ignited the largest trade war in economic history,â€? Chinaâ€™s Commerce Ministry said in a earlier statement. â€œSuch tariffs are typical trade bullying, and this action threatens global supply chains and value chains, stalls the global economic recovery, triggers global market turmoil, and will hurt more innocent multinational companies, enterprises and consumers.â€?European stocks gained after a rally in Asian shares buoyed sentiment, even as China put in place its response to well-telegraphed U.S. trade tariffs. Havens headed lower.The riskiest economic gamble of Trumpâ€™s presidency could spread as it enters a new and dangerous phase by imposing direct costs on companies and consumers globally. Itâ€™s the first time the U.S. has imposed tariffs aimed just at Chinese goods and follows months of accusations that Beijing stole American intellectual property and unfairly swelled Americaâ€™s trade deficit.'Clearly the first salvos have been exchanged and in that sense, the trade war has started. There is no obvious end to this,' said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at Oxford Economics.As the worldâ€™s most developed nation and the rule-maker of the current global governing system, there is 'astounding absurdity' in the U.S. complaining that itâ€™s been bullied in trade, the Peopleâ€™s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party of China, said in a Chinese language commentary on Friday.Trump is doubling down on his promise to put â€œAmerica Firstâ€? in the nationâ€™s foreign and economic policies. He blames China for a bilateral trade deficit of $336 billion and for costing U.S. manufacturing jobs.WHAT OUR ECONOMISTS SAY As a candidate in 2016, Donald Trump won support with a promise to redress an unbalanced trade relationship with the rest of the world. In the White House in 2018, he has started to make good on that pledge. Bloomberg Economicsâ€™ base case remains more trade skirmish than trade war, but the risks are increasing.-- Jamie Murray, Bloomberg EconomicsRead more for the full research note on economic costs of a trade war.The tariffs could jeopardize a U.S. economic upswing that has extended to nine years and pushed the jobless rate to the lowest in nearly half a century. U.S. and Chinese companies will now find it costlier to trade with each other, meaning less demand and higher prices. The International Monetary Fund warns an extended spat could undermine the strongest global expansion since 2011.Risk to GrowthThe extent of the economic damage will depend on how far both sides go. If the U.S. and China cool off after a first round of tariffs, the impact on their economies will be modest, according to Bloomberg Economics. Under a full-blown trade war in which the U.S. slaps 10 percent tariffs on all other countries and they respond, the economists reckon U.S. growth would slow by 0.8 percentage point by 2020.The impact of the first round of tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods will be â€œquite small,â€? said Ethan Harris, head of global economic research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. But he doesnâ€™t â€œsee the war ending until there are casualties.â€?JPMorgan Chase & Co. economists warn the biggest risk may come from the indirect impact of tightening credit conditions and business confidence, reducing scope for investment and hiring while undermining financial markets.Economic ModelBeijing has shown little interest in making fundamental changes to its economic model. Xi has balked at U.S. demands to stop subsidizing Chinese firms under his plan to make the nation a leader in key technologies by 2025. Negotiations between the two countries petered out with the Chinese accusing the U.S. of blackmail.The U.S. imports much more from China than the reverse, giving the U.S. an advantage in a tariff dispute. That means that if the dispute deteriorates, Beijing will run out of products to impose tariffs on much faster than the U.S., and so might retaliate against American companies operating in China. It could even take the drastic steps of devaluing the yuan or reducing its $1.2 trillion holdings of U.S. Treasuries, measures that would hurt it as well as the U.S.In the past, the U.S. used its economic clout to win trade skirmishes with developing countries, said James Boughton, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, Ontario. China, whose economy has grown tenfold since it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, poses a much more formidable adversary.â€œThe dynamic is different from anything weâ€™ve seen,â€? said Boughton. â€œChina has an ability to ride out this kind of pressure, to weather the storm, that a lot of countries didnâ€™t have in the past.â€?â€” With assistance by Xiaoqing Pi, Yinan Zhao, Miao Han, Andrew Mayeda, Jennifer Jacobs, and Dandan Li",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is prepared for a trade war with the United States, but the U.S should consider the costs of starting one, an expert on U.S.-China relations said Thursday.Robert Ross, a professor of political science at Boston College, told CNBC: 'The Chinese have made it clear: 'You want a trade war? We're prepared.' And they are. Because of course they have a very large market and a very robust economy.'In fact, nationalistic state media outlet Global Times said in a Wednesday op-ed that China should be ready for a 'looming trade war.''Beijing needs to give Washington head-on blows in a similar manner and must not be soft,' the op-ed said.It's worth considering the possible fallout for Americans and U.S. companies operating in China, if there is a trade war, he said.'We should remember two things. One, Chinese exports to the United States improve the American standard of living by selling less expensive goods to United States that we benefit from â€” and we don't make those goods anymore.''Second, there are an awful lot of American companies that are making large sums of profits inside China, whether it's AppleAAPL, whether it's Buick, whether it's other American companies,' he told CNBC's 'The Rundown.''One should be cautious before we say this is a one-way street,' Ross said of the economic relationship between the U.S. and China.Reports on Tuesday said President Donald Trump administration is considering a trade package including tariffs on $60 billion worth of Chinese goods, which may target the tech and telecommunications sectors â€” among others â€” in China.Ross also pointed out that the trade deficit with China â€” at a record $276 billion last year â€” is a result primarily of economic factors instead of policy issues.'The Chinese have a very high savings rate, the Americans have a very low savings rate. We consume more than they do, we're going to have a trade deficit. Now, do you fix that through policy? Do you fix that through trade wars? Highly highly debatable.'Larry Kudlow, who Trump has tapped to be his new chief economic advisor, also had harsh words for Beijing on Wednesday, calling for a 'coalition of large trading partners and allies against China.'But Ross said such a coalition was unlikely.'The Europeans are constantly tripping over each other to get advantages in China. And to think they would fall behind the United States and impose sanctions that would put at risk their own economic growth â€” I don't think that's probable at all.'Furthermore, if China becomes a trade adversary, it does not portend well for any U.S. talks with North Korea on denuclearization, he said.'It becomes a lot more difficult to ask for Chinese cooperation on something we care about when we are treating them like a trade adversary,' Ross said, predicting that Chinese cooperation and interest in the North Korea problem would diminish.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Â© Dave Hughes/Getty Images Chinaâ€™s response to U.S. tariffs aims to hit the Trump administration right in its natural resources.The worldâ€™s largest commodities consumer on Friday said it will levy a first round of tariffs on $34 billion worth of U.S. agriculture products, as well as automobiles, starting July 6. Another $16 billion in goods, including coal and oil, will be subject to tariffs later. The escalating dispute sent the prices of everything from soybeans to copper lower and hit the shares of U.S. coal producers while boosting the prospects for alternative suppliers like Brazil.By focusing on agriculture and energy, the tariffs target rural communities in states that voted for Trump in 2016. Beijingâ€™s announcement came less than 12 hours after the U.S. released its list of $50 billion worth of Chinese products subject to tariffs. As recently as May, the Asian nation said it would seek to buy more U.S. agricultural and energy products as part of a tentative trade truce between the two countries.AgricultureFarm commodities have been a key battleground in the trade war between the worldâ€™s two biggest economies. In April, the Asian nation started levying additional taxes on American fruit, nuts, pork and wine in response to Trump tariffs on steel and aluminum. Products affected include soy, corn, wheat, rice, sorghum, beef, pork, poultry, fish, dairy products, nuts and vegetables.The list covers almost all farm products imported from the U.S., said Li Qiang, chief analyst with Shanghai JC Intelligence Co. Ltd. â€œGiven Chinaâ€™s big trade surplus with the U.S., it will be more difficult and complicated for Chinaâ€? in the future to retaliate if Washington expands the tariff to cover more products, said Li. The new list includes more agricultural produce, including dairy, alfalfa and seafood, than its initial list published in April .Â© Bloomberg Import DependenceIn 2017, Chinaâ€™s agriculture imports from U.S. were worth $24.1 billion, the Peopleâ€™s Daily reported on May 24, citing customs data. Thatâ€™s about 19 percent of total farm imports worth $125.86 billion, according to Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs data.CoalThe coal tariffs strike at the heart of Trumpâ€™s energy agenda. Since he was elected, the president has been trying to make good on a campaign promise to revive Americaâ€™s coal industry. They also come as U.S. miners have grown increasingly dependent on foreign markets for growth. U.S. coal exports jumped by 61 percent in 2017 as shipments to Asia more than doubled.A few weeks ago, China was looking at buying more from the U.S.. While itâ€™s pursuing a long-term goal of using less coal, the country still produces, consumes and imports more than any other nation. It purchased 271 million metric tons from overseas last year, according to customs data. The U.S. exported about 3.2 million short tons to China, data from the Energy Information Administration show.Â© Bloomberg China's Coal ImportsThe total value of U.S. coal exported to China last year was about $395 million, based on an average price of $122 per ton, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. About 90 percent was metallurgical coal, which is used to make steel.CrudeChina has been a key recipient of American oil since a 40-year U.S. ban on exports was ended by then-President Barack Obama in 2015. The Asian nation is helping drive a surge in exports from the U.S. -- China imported 18.4 million barrels of American crude and oil products in March, making it the third-biggest customer behind Mexico and Canada.Â© Bloomberg Crude ConsumersFor China, the biggest importer of oil in the world, U.S. crude is just a small part of its portfolio, with major suppliers like Saudi Arabia and Russia having the biggest shares. China spent $162.3 billion on crude purchases in 2017, with just $3.16 billion of that going to the U.S.GasChinaâ€™s booming demand for natural gas has also made it a key market for U.S. exports of LNG. China is the third-largest buyer of U.S. liquefied natural gas, after Mexico and South Korea. Record production from Americaâ€™s shale plays has allowed the U.S. to become a net exporter of the fuel for the first time since the 1950s.Â© Bloomberg Gas Needed The Asian nation is set to become the worldâ€™s largest importer of LNG in the next decade, and several proposed U.S. export projects are seeking long-term buyers to finance construction. Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts Chinaâ€™s imports will grow to 82 million tons a year by 2030, but the country has long-term contracts to supply just 42.5 million tons by then.There had been signs of growing cooperation between the two countries. Earlier this year, China National Petroleum Corp. signed a 25-year deal with Cheniere Energy Inc. to buy U.S. gas. China Petrochemical Corp. has signed a joint development agreement with a proposed export plant in Alaska, and China Gas Holdings Ltd. has agreed to purchase 3 million tons of LNG a year from Delfin LNGâ€™s proposed plant in the Gulf of Mexico.Cars, WhiskeyWhile U.S. automakers import few vehicles into China, the tariffs pose a significant threat to BMW AG and Daimler AGâ€™s American factories that make vehicles both for domestic buyers and export markets.Tesla Inc. also builds all of its vehicles in Fremont, California, and the tariffs could compromise affordability in its second-biggest market in the world. Revenue from deliveries to China surged 90 percent last year to $2.03 billion.Other iconic American products on the list, like whiskey, may be more symbolic. Last year, China imported only $12.8 million worth of U.S. spirits, about 70 percent of which was whiskey, according to the Distilled Spirits Council. Brown-Forman Corp., the maker of Jack Danielâ€™s, doesnâ€™t even list China as a top 10 market, though net sales growth there was in the double digits last year.On Saturday, Chinaâ€™s Commerce Ministry announced it will collect anti-dumping deposits on imports of hydriodic acid and ethanolamine from the U.S., of which Iofina Chemical Inc. and Dow Chemical Co. are major suppliers.--With assistance from Anne Riley Moffat, Joe Ryan, Craig Trudell, Christine Buurma, Kevin Crowley, Sheela Tobben and Niu Shuping.To contact the reporter on this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski in Singapore at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tina Davis at tinadavis@bloomberg.net, John McCluskeyÂ©2018 Bloomberg L.P.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Â© Provided by WP Company LLC d/b/a The Washington PostPresident Trump's decision Friday to put hefty tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese products means costs are going up for a lot of goods. A tariff is another word for a tax, and Trump just announced significant new taxes on 1,102 items.This is no longer a war of words between Trump and China. There are actual economic consequences now. The result is that Americans will almost certainly face higher costs as companies pay more for parts they need to build cars, dishwashers and tractors, and then firms turn around and pass those higher prices onto consumers.All of Trumps tariffs so far â€” on China, on steel and aluminum, on washing machines and on solar panels â€” will end up costing the average U.S. family $80 a year, Moody's Analytics estimates in a report to be released next week. If Trump continues to pile tariffs on China (he has threatened to do another $100 billion) and China retaliates, then the cost to the average family would rise to $210, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs has also forecast rising prices from the tariffs.The Tax Foundation, a think tank that supported Trump's tax law, predicts that more than 45,000 jobs will be lost because of the tariffs Trump has issued so far. They also forecast a small hit to the economy and wages. Analysts Kyle Pomerleau and Erica York argue that the tariffs will hurt the economy because prices will rise, reducing profits for companies and costing consumers more. Alternatively, tariffs could cause the U.S. dollar to rise, which usually makes it more difficult for American companies to sell their products abroad, another potential hit to jobs and the economy.The effects of a trade war are difficult to fully predict, in part because how much pain they'll cause the United States depends on how other countries respond. And, of course, the worst case may not come to pass if Trump and China's President Xi Jinping strike a deal soon. But the bottom line is that a lot of different organizations, including ones that typically lean to the right, are all saying costs are probably going up from these tariffs.Subscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Todayâ€™s most popular stories on The Washington PostEven Trump agrees with that.In a rally in late April in Michigan, he told supporters to be prepared for â€œa little painâ€? in this fight with China and the European Union. He actually issued the warning twice.First he said: â€œThere may be a little pain for a little while, but ultimately for my farmers, I love my farmers. They are great patriots. â€¦ You're going to do much better.â€?Then Trump said: â€œWhen we lose $500 billion a year â€¦ in a trade deficit. When we lose hundreds of billions of dollars in intellectual property theft, not only China but others, we have to stop it. We canâ€™t allow this to happen. So in a certain way, I call people patriots because â€¦ short-term you may have to take some problems. Long-term, youâ€™re going to be so happy. Youâ€™re going to be so happy.â€?Trump is calling on Americans to pay higher prices for a while because he thinks it will be worth it if he gets concessions from China and the E.U. It's what economists and business leaders call a cost-benefit analysis, and Trump is arguing it will be worth it in the end.But plenty of people are running that cost-benefit calculation in their head and saying it is not worth it. A slew of businesses and Republicans in Congress are urging Trump to stop. They say these tariffs are harming too many U.S. companies and families. That's because higher costs don't hit everyone equally.The reality is every family isn't going to pay $80. Some families are likely to pay hundreds or thousands or be the ones losing jobs and livelihoods, while most others probably won't notice the price increases.For example, â€œlaundry equipmentâ€? prices have shot up 17 percent since Trump put tariffs on washing machines in January. Families that are buying a new washing machine now probably aren't happy, but the majority of Americans aren't shopping for a new washing machine and may not care much.Trump's latest round of tariffs is hitting a lot of farm equipment, such as combines used in harvesting and parts for milking machines. For America's 2.1 million farms, that could hurt a lot, especially since China is retaliating by putting tariffs on a lot of U.S. agricultural products. But the rest of the United States might not notice.China, Canada and the E.U. have targeted politically vulnerable parts of America with their retaliatory tariffs. It's another reason many Republicans are urging Trump to back down. They also say that growth, which is picking up after the Republican tax cut and extra government spending, is now in doubt because of the tariffs.Gary Cohn, Trump's former top economic adviser, went as far as to say Trump's tariffs could wipe out the entire economic gains of the tax cuts at a Washington Post Live event this week.But Trump and (most of) his top advisers say this is about winning the big economic war of the 21st century. China and the United States are fighting for dominance in technology and biotechnology. Trump and his team say the United States won't win if China keeps stealing American intellectual property and technology secrets. Years of talks have only made it worse, they say, and it's time for action.Thatâ€™s why Trump told farmers and blue-collar supporters in Michigan to buckle up for a bumpy ride for a while. But he also told them it will be worth it in the end.Trump's top trade negotiator, U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer, told Fox Business a similar story Friday morning, calling the new tariffs â€œvery moderate.â€?â€œWe hope that this leads to further negotiations. We hope it leads to China changing its policies,â€? Lighthizer said.But Trump is making a gamble. If he does end up getting China to concede on big issues, such as IP theft, many will probably say it was worth it. But for the farmer or the small auto parts manufacturer that may have a terrible year or go out of business during the tariff battle, it probably won't feel worth it. And if China doesn't give in some, Trump will have upset many nations around the world with tariffs and have little to show for it but upset consumers â€” and potentially upset voters.Related:U.S. and China announce new tariffs in escalation of trade warThis was not the dream for U.S.-China tradeTrade war could wipe out gains of GOP tax law, Gary Cohn says",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also diversifying imports away from America.Since China opened up its economy to global trade in 2001, it has taken advantage of cheap imports of soybeans from the U.S. and other countries.But after the U.S. hiked tariffs on an initial batch of $34 billion of Chinese goods on Friday, China retaliated with matching tariffs on an equal amount of U.S. imports â€” including soybeans.Analysts say the crop was chosen because of the political pain it can cause Trump supporters in his political heartland.China recently also announced zero tariffs on soybeans from India, Bangladesh and other Asian countries.Beijing is the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, importing some $14 billion last year â€” or about two-thirds of American farm exports to China.< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > Image: Soybean oilBottles are filled with soybean oil made from the U.S. imported soybeans on a production line at a plant in Qufu, China, on July 4. Â© Provided by NBCU News Group, a division of NBCUniversal Media LLC'Take a day without meat, but not a day without beans' is a well-known Chinese saying, and cheap U.S. soybeans are processed into products from cooking oil to pig feed. China is home to half of the world's pigs.'Sometimes, I think a trade war with the U.S. is a mistake, but it will be nice if the government is willing to subsidize us â€” the more, the better,' Rao, 46, told NBC News.His cooperative of seven farmers has shifted most of its 2,400 acres of land to soybeans in response to the government's appeal.'Our farmers really hope that China will import less soybeans so that domestic soybean production and soybean-related businesses will flourish,' said Yang Guiyun, the sales manager of an agricultural company in Bayan County in Heilongjiang Province, an area that is China's largest soybean producer.A key part of China's new 'great food strategy,' as analyst Zhengyuan Bo described it, is to boost domestic production.As part of the plan, China aims to add 1.6 million acres to its existing soybean acreage of 21 million. The government is also offering subsidies ranging from $190 to $320 per acre, compared to $150 previously. Local media reports have described the drive as a 'political priority.'Harbin-based agricultural manager Cao Guangxing said that the market price of soybeans has been kept low by imports, meaning many farmers have focused on other crops. 'Without subsidy, we won't grow soybeans,' Cao added.Rao, the farmer, singled out American produce. 'It's the genetically modified U.S. soybeans that are depressing prices,' he said.Wang Erda, a professor at the Dalian University of Technology who has researched agricultural economics in U.S. farming states, said that it was important for China to boost its 'self-reliance and develop other sources of imports.''China has no choice but to play hard ball, too,' he added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MGN OnlineCBS News: U.S. stocks were well off their lows by late morning, a recovery from an initial drop sparked by fears of a trade war with China.All three major indexes were down around half a percent -- when trading began Wednesday, declines were closer to 2 percent.Among the biggest decliners are U.S. carmakers, aerospace companies and chipmakers, with concerns that these companies may be hurt in a trade war. Boeing (BA) shares dropped nearly 3 percent.Investors fear a full-blown trade war between China and the U.S., with both Beijing and Washington detailing plans to hike tariffs on a broad swath of imported goods from each other in series of announcements issued within 24 hours.But many investors hope that despite tough rhetoric, both sides will negotiate and avoid the most aggressive actions that would weigh on economic growth.Larry Kudlow, economic adviser to President Donald Trump tried to calm fears. Speaking on Fox Business Network, Kudlow acknowledged the need to get tough on China, but also described a long process that will include negotiations. 'There's no trade war here,' he said.China on Wednesday issued a list of more than 100 U.S. goods, amounting to $50 billion in imports, targeted for a possible 25 percent tariff hike.Beijing was responding to an announcement hours earlier by President Donald Trump's administration outlining proposed tariffs on 1,300 imported Chinese products, including industrial robots and telecommunications gear, to protest Beijing's alleged theft of U.S. technology.In a morning tweet, President Donald on Wednesday pointed to 'a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion' a year with China, adding that intellectual property theft by Chinese companies costs the U.S. 'another $300 Billion.'Analysts worry the Trump administration's increasing protectionism may crimp economic growth, especially as China's response has been tougher than some expected.'If protecting U.S. intellectual property is the ultimate goal here, I'm not sure how destroying shareholder wealth, damaging CEO confidence and making the American farmer the main sacrificial lamb here after six years of pain on the farm is going to get us there,' said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group, in a client note.China's envoy to the WTO said Beijing would challenge the U.S. moves. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said the date the tariff hikes take effect depends on whether the U.S. actually moves to raise its duties.'The Chinese government has nonetheless responded more aggressively to the tariff list than many had expected,' noted Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a research note.After a flat open, European markets fell sharply once the China tariffs were announced. Most Asian indexes had closed when China announced its response to the U.S. tariff plans.The Shanghai Composite slipped 0.2 percent while Hong Kong's Hang Seng slumped 2.2 percent, with the decline accelerating in the final minutes of trading after Beijing announced specifics of its tariff hikes.'The losses more than wipe out Tuesday's rebound and set us on course for another worrying session driven by fears that a trade war between the world's two largest economies is heating up with neither side showing any sign of backing down,' said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Reprinted with permission from Creators.When White House economic adviser Gary Cohn showed up in the Oval Office earlier this year to give Donald Trump news of an excellent jobs report, the presidentâ€™s keen grasp of economics and policy instantly came into play. â€œItâ€™s all because of my tariffs,â€? he replied, according to Bob Woodwardâ€™s new book, â€œFear.â€? Cohn had to inform him that the tariffs were not yet in effect.Now they are, and the news is not so sunny. The Federal Reserve reported Wednesday that already, â€œTariffs are reported to be contributing to rising input costs, mainly for manufacturers,â€? and worries about trade disputes have â€œprompted some businesses to scale back or postpone capital investment.â€?Eighty percent of the worldâ€™s recreational vehicles are built in and around Elkhart County, Indiana, which voted for Trump by a 2-1 margin. When times are bad, people donâ€™t buy RVs, because they are a luxury, not a necessity. The Great Recession walloped Elkhart, which saw its unemployment rate hit 20 percent. Nine years later, the rate is 2.3 percent. But RV sales are falling and some plants have cut production to four days a week.Why? Trump has imposed new duties on steel and aluminum, two commodities needed to build motor homes, campers and the like. Elkhart County-based Smoker Craft, which makes pontoon boats, said because of European retaliation the price of a typical new rig could climb from $30,000 to $37,000. Meanwhile, the tariffs imposed by Canada in retaliation have shriveled a market that previously accounted for a quarter of the companyâ€™s sales.â€œThis is a really big deal for us,â€? Elkhart county commissioner Mike Yoder, a Republican, told The New York Times. â€œWe export a lot of product and import a lot of product. If this whole trade dispute expands much more, it has serious implications, and we will once again lead the country into a recession, without a doubt.â€?He has plenty of company in his anxiety, well beyond northern Indiana. A group of more than 80 trade associations representing U.S. farmers, retailers, toy makers, fisheries, tech companies and others has launched a campaign with the slogan â€œTariffs Hurt the Heartland.â€?New trade barriers do no good for them or their customers. The American Apparel and Footwear Association, which is part of this coalition, says, â€œWe urge the American consumer to buy their warm winter clothing now, as itâ€™s shaping up to be a long, dreary, and bitter tariff season ahead.â€? Parents in need of baby strollers and car seats â€œcould see prices increase dramatically,â€? warns the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association.The presidentâ€™s fixation on blocking imports and punishing trade partners, it must be said, is producing some worthy achievements. One is enlightening many people who voted for him in the mistaken belief that he knew what he was doing.A new NPR/Marist poll found that his support is declining even in small towns, where 46 percent of voters disapprove of his performance, compared with 41 percent who approve. All this is before Trump follows through on his threat to slap fees on $200 billion of Chinese goods.His trade war has also illuminated the value of free trade in way that everyone can see. When a single industry or corporation laments the threat of foreign competition, it can point to the jobs it provides. The intended benefit â€” saving them â€” is obvious.Granting it relief may raise prices, but not enough for most people to notice or object. Trumpâ€™s broad increase in import taxes, by contrast, canâ€™t be ignored: Itâ€™s too large and affects too many American companies. It could have hardly been designed more effectively to inflict palpable harm across a wide swath of the country and the economy.But the benefits, if any, are exceedingly narrow. The steel industry, which stands to gain from the tariffs, employs only 140,000 people. Set that against more than 2 million farmers, 5 million retail workers and 1.3 million auto dealer employees â€” all of whom stand to lose and many of whom realize it.In the past, protectionism could be portrayed as a negative only for foreign companies. Now itâ€™s become clear that imports are a vital element in the functioning of the economy and that the government restricts them at our peril.If the trade fight continues and expands, a lot of Americans will suffer from the effects, losing jobs and paying higher prices.

"Reprinted with permission from Shareblue.Trumpâ€™s trade war is also a war on American workers â€” including workers at iconically American companies like Ford.Ford has already lost $1 billion thanks to Trumpâ€™s trade war, NBC News reports. And now the American automaker is looking at thousands of layoffs as part of a reorganization strategy.The exact number of layoffs is unknown, but is estimated to be about 24,000 workers worldwide, according to a recent analysis from Morgan Stanley.â€œFord has already warned that President Donald Trumpâ€™s auto tariffs have impacted the company to the tune of $1 billion, and the presidentâ€™s trade policies threaten to play havoc with Fordâ€™s ongoing reorganization,â€? Ford CFO Bob Shanks told NBC News.The popular Ford Mustang could also be on the chopping block as a direct result of Trumpâ€™s trade war with China. The Mustang had been the most popular U.S. car in China before the country imposed tariffs on American-made vehicles in response to Trumpâ€™s tariffs.Now Ford may have to cut production on its most iconically American car, which would also mean a reduction of U.S. jobs.Trumpâ€™s actions are a striking contrast with what President Obama did to save the American auto industry just a decade ago.After the 2008 Great Recession, U.S. auto manufacturers were in deep trouble. General Motors (GM) was in the most trouble â€” but if GM went under, then the ripple effect would have led to â€œa partial collapse of the supplier industry that would lead to a 50 percent drop in production at Ford and the American-based foreign car plants,â€? Politifact notes.In 2012, Ford CEO Alan Mulally said, â€œIf GM and Chrysler wouldâ€™ve gone into free-fall, they couldâ€™ve taken the entire supply base into free-fall also, and taken the U.S. from a recession into a depression.â€?President Obamaâ€™s actions to save jobs in the auto industry gained bipartisan praise, including from the Economist and even the very conservative Heritage Foundation.Trump, on the other hand, is wreaking havoc on the auto industry and pushing Ford into cutting production and laying off workers.Ford is far from the only business to suffer under Trumpâ€™s ill-advised trade war. Factories are shutting down and sending jobs to Mexico, companies like Whirlpool and Harley Davidson are seeing huge economic losses, and farmers across the country are struggling.The trade war is even making recovery from natural disasters more expensive for homeowners in the Carolinas trying to rebuild after Hurricane Florence.Some economic experts question whether Trump even knows how tariffs work.But whether or not Trump understands the consequences of his actions, American workers are suffering those consequences every day.Published with permission of The American Independent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin is offering a mixed reaction to President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs widely panned by Republicans.Baldwin said Thursday that the tariffs send 'a strong message to bad actors like China' but also called for Trump to exempt European trading partners and do more to 'target China's cheating.'Baldwin says the best way to support Wisconsin workers is to enact strong buy-American standards like she's supported and renegotiate a better deal on the North American Free Trade Agreement.House Speaker Paul Ryan and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, both Republicans, criticized Trump's move and said the tariffs could have unintended consequences like a trade war.House Speaker Paul Ryan and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson are both speaking out against tariffs announced by President Donald Trump.Both Ryan and Johnson said Thursday they fear the unintended consequences from the steel and aluminum tariffs Trump announced over objections from many fellow Republicans. Trump says he is fulfilling a campaign promise.Canada and Mexico would be exempt from the tariffs. Ryan says he hopes Trump will continue to narrow the policy to focus only on countries that violate trade law.'I actually think there is a better and more effective way to address unfair trade practices, and that is to go after those practices specifically,' Ryan said. 'I really think best policy is to be surgical and specific and go after those specific unfair trade practices because they are unfair and the president is right to point that out. I'm just not a fan of broad-based across-the-board tariffs because you'll have a lot of unintended consequences.'Johnson calls the tariffs a 'very risky action' that could spark a trade war. He says he expects the action to be challenged in court.Johnson says the tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum 'can really case very serious unintended consequences.' Johnson says he fears that retaliation could hurt Wisconsin's agricultural and manufacturing industries, putting jobs at risk.'Look I don't expect him to agree with me 100% of the time. There's a wide divide in this country and between individuals. President trump has had this position for decades,' Johnson said. 'I come from a manufacturing background, exported product to 20, 25 countries around the world. If it's targeted toward china, depending on how it's tailored, i may not have a problem with it. That's where the root cause of the problem is, the gross oversupply within china and their trade abuses. A generalized tariff that would harm allies, harm american consumers, by the way, harm american workers that use steel in production, hurting their competitive nature in global markets as well, i'm opposed to that.Trump says his tariffs, which exempt Mexico and Canada, fulfill a campaign promise.Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin did not immediately return a message seeking comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some central Illinois farmers said they are wary about making any big investments in the near future after fears of a trade war with China became reality Friday, with President Donald Trump imposing 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion worth of goods from that country.Dennis Riggs, 63, who farms south of Sidney, said many of the investments he has been wanting to make on his farm are now 'out of the question,' because China launched its own set of tariffs on American goods like soybeans, corn, pork and poultry in retaliation.'No way,' Riggs said about buying new equipment. 'If the prices keep going down the way they have this past month, all I can do is cover my costs. Farmers, we're price takers, not price makers. So there's only so much we can do.'Soybean farmers are especially concerned that the tariffs will further lower prices that have, in the past month, plunged by 17 percent.And Trump said Thursday that higher tariffs on an additional $16 billion of Chinese goods are coming in the next two weeks, setting up what could be a tariff on $550 billion worth of goods â€” more than the $506 billion in Chinese imports last year.Lynn Rohrscheib, chairwoman of the Illinois Soybean Growers, who farms near Moweaqua, called Friday for a return to free trade and access to the Chinese market.'We are disappointed that agriculture continues to be placed in the middle of the tariff debate with China,' Rohrscheib said. 'We urge the Trump administration and China to rescind these tariffs that leave our farmers footing the bill.'She calls instead for both countries to negotiate in ways that will 'strengthen the competitiveness of our domestic industries' while keeping growth in the agricultural export sector.In a lot of ways, though, what China is doing isn't that strange, according to Illinois Soybean Growers marketing committee chairman Austin Rincker, who farms south of Decatur. This is the time of year, he said, when Chinese soy product producers switch from American soy to Brazilian soybeans as they are further along in their growing season.So these tariffs China is imposing on goods like American soybeans won't, in the long term, affect their production of soy goods but are something American producers have to keep an eye on.'We just want what we had before,' he said. 'Soybean demand is there, and it's really, really big as soybeans go into different channels. And this year, we have had a lot of great opportunities to hedge and sell soybeans at a good price. A lot of the problems recently are that speculators oversold the soybean market.'Steve Hettinger, 55, who farms south of Philo, said that when he hears the word tariff, it never has a good connotation.'We want open and free markets,' Hettinger said. 'We gave so much of this (soybean) products now that the last thing we need is to limit sales. I just hope that this is part of a master plan that will make things better in the long run.'That's certainly the way 34-year-old Jason Crider feels.'The way I see it is that Trump is trying to help us by making the playing field a bit more even,' Crider said. 'I really hope that in the long run it helps us, even if right now we have to deal with it dragging the prices down.'Riggs said farmers are 'hopeless optimists' when it comes to the future.'What else do we do?' he asked. 'I'm not going to start growing anything else. Our soil, transportation systems, they're all set up to grow corn and soybeans. And I'm not going to sell the farm because then I don't have anything. I just want our elected officials to do what we can't: open up markets for us.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Beijing agreed in a joint statement with the U.S. to 'substantially reduce' America's trade deficit with ChinaWASHINGTON â€” The United States and China are pulling back from the brink of a trade war after the world's two biggest economies reported progress in talks aimed at bringing down America's massive trade deficit with Beijing.'We are putting the trade war on hold,' Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday.After high-level talks Thursday and Friday in Washington, Beijing agreed in a joint statement with the U.S. to 'substantially reduce' America's trade deficit with China, but did not commit to cut the gap by any specific amount. The Trump administration had sought to slash the deficit by $200 billion.Still, Mnuchin said the two countries had made 'meaningful progress' and that the administration has agreed to put on hold proposed tariffs on up to $150 billion in Chinese products. China had promised to retaliate in a move that threatened a tit for tat trade war.He said they expect to see a big increase â€” 35 percent to 45 percent this year alone â€” in U.S. farm sales to China. Mnuchin also forecast a doubling in sales of U.S. energy products to the Chinese market, increasing energy exports by $50 billion to $60 billion in the next three years to five years.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has been part of the U.S. negotiating team, will go to China soon to follow up on last week's discussions, Mnuchin said.In Saturday's statement, Beijing committed to 'significantly increase' its purchases of American goods and services, saying the increase would 'meet the growing consumption needs of the Chinese people and the need for high-quality economic development.'Last year, the U.S. had a record $376 billion deficit with China in the trade of goods; that was the largest by far with any nation.Trade analysts were not surprised that China refused to agree to a numerical target for cutting the trade gap, but they said the talks probably were more successful in easing trade tensions.'The Trump administration seems eager to engineer at minimum a temporary peace with China to ensure a smooth run-up to the Kim-Trump summit in June,' Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad said, referring to the June 12 meeting scheduled between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.If there is success in the U.S.-China discussions, analysts suggest it likely would involve the countries' presidents this fall before the November elections.'Part of the good news for markets: As long as both sides continue to be 'constructively' engaged, imposition of additional tariffs by either side is very unlikely,' analysts at investment management firm Evercore ISI said in a research note. 'There is no reason for either side â€” particularly the U.S. â€” to destroy the process that both sides are building, which is what imposing tariffs would do.'Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., praised the administration's efforts with China.'It's smart to engage China on trade abuses, and it would also be smart to get them more involved in trying to help us with North Korea,' Graham said.Trump campaigned in 2016 on a pledge to get tough on China and other U.S. trading partners. He views the U.S. trade deficit with China as evidence that Beijing is engaged in abusive trading practices and has outmaneuvered previous U.S. administrations.Last August, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer began investigating Beijing's strong-arm tactics to challenge U.S. technological dominance. These include outright cybertheft of U.S. companies' trade secrets and China's demands that American corporations hand over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese markets.Last month, the administration proposed tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports to protest the forced technology transfers. Trump later ordered Lighthizer to seek up to an additional $100 billion in Chinese products to tax.China responded by targeting $50 billion in U.S. products, including soybeans â€” a shot at Trump supporters in America's heartland. The prospect of an escalating trade war has shaken financial markets and alarmed business leaders.In a separate controversy, the Commerce Department last month blocked China's ZTE Corp. from importing American components for seven years, accusing the telecommunications company of misleading U.S. regulators after it settled charges last year of violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea.The ban amounted to a death sentence for ZTE, which relies heavily on U.S. parts, and the company announced that it was halting operations. A week ago, Trump tweeted that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to put ZTE 'back in business, fast.' Media reports suggested that the U.S. was offering to swap a ZTE rescue for an end to proposed Chinese tariffs on U.S. farm products.Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called Trump's intervention in the case 'outrageous' and said that using ZTE 'as a bargaining chip ... is not in the best interests of our national security.'White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said there could be 'some small changes around the edges' in the sanctions against ZTE. But Kudlow added: 'Do not expect ZTE to get off scot-free. It ain't gonna happen.'Mnuchin and Graham appeared on 'Fox News Sunday,' Warner spoke on CNN's 'State of the Union' and Kudlow was interviewed on ABC's 'This Week.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Australian shares closed sharply lower on Friday after fears of a trade war were sparked by US president Donald Trump's surprise announcement of tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium. CEO of the US Studies Centre Simon Jackman told Sky News, if the US tariffs hit China it could be good news for agricultural exporters in Australia in the short term.US President Donald Trump on Friday insisted â€œtrade wars are good, and easy to win,â€? a bold claim that prompted threats of retaliation against US businesses like blue jeans and motorcycles.â€œMake no mistake: If the president goes through with this, it will kill American jobs â€” thatâ€™s what every trade war ultimately does,â€? said Republican Senator Ben Sasse.Mr Trump has declared that the US will impose punishing tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. The move will likely raise steel and aluminium prices in the US.Thatâ€™s good for US manufacturers, but itâ€™s bad for companies that use the metals, and it prompted red flags from industries ranging from tool and dye makers to beer distributors to manufacturers of airconditioners. The American International Automobile Dealers Association warned it would drive prices up â€œsubstantially.â€?Markets tumbled in Asia, where China expressed â€œgrave concern,â€? and the weakness spread to Europe, where the European Union promised retaliation against American exports if Mr Trump follows through. In the United States, the S & P 500 dropped as much as 1.1 per cent before paring its decline.â€œNone of this is reasonable, but reason is a sentiment thatâ€™s very unevenly distributed in the world,â€? said Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the EUâ€™s executive body.Asked if a trade war is brewing, he said: â€œI canâ€™t see how this isnâ€™t part of warlike behaviour.â€?Mr Trump took to Twitter to defend himself early on Friday morning: â€œWhen a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, donâ€™t trade anymore-we win big. Itâ€™s easy!â€?He later tweeted: â€œOur steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DONâ€™T HAVE STEEL, YOU DONâ€™T HAVE A COUNTRY!â€?Senator Sasse echoed a sentiment of many US politicians when he issued a statement in response: â€œKooky 18th century protectionism will jack up prices on American families.â€?Mr Trumpâ€™s announcement came only after an intense internal White House debate. It brought harsh criticism from some Republicans and roiled financial markets with concerns about economic ramifications.Mr Trump has long railed against what he deems unfair trade practices by China and others. This week, he summoned steel and aluminium executives to the White House and declared he would levy penalties of 25 per cent on imported steel and 10 per cent on aluminium imports. The tariffs, he said, would remain for â€œa long period of time,â€? but it was not immediately clear if certain trading partners would be exempt.â€œThis is going to have fallout on our downstream suppliers, particularly in the automotive, machinery and aircraft sectors,â€? said Wendy Cutler, a former US trade official who is now vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute.â€œWhat benefits one industry can hurt another. What saves one job can jeopardise another.â€? Steel-consuming companies said steel tariffs imposed in 2002 by President George W. Bush ended up wiping out 200,000 US jobs.The decision had been strenuously debated within the White House, with top officials such as economic adviser Gary Cohn and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis raising concerns.The penalties were pushed by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, an economist who has favoured taking aggressive action.Mattis, in a memo to Commerce, said US military requirements for steel and aluminium represent about 3 pe recent of U.S. production and that the department was â€œconcerned about the negative impact on our key alliesâ€? of any tariffs. He added that targeted tariffs would be preferable to global quotas or tariffs.Plans for Mr Trump to make an announcement were thrown into doubt for a time because of the internal divisions. The actual event caught some top White House officials off guard and left aides scrambling for details. Key Senate offices also did not receive advance notice.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the decision â€œshouldnâ€™t come as a surprise to anyone,â€? noting that the president had been talking about it â€œfor decades.â€?On Friday, she told reporters that Mr Trump wasnâ€™t concerned about the dayâ€™s market decline, adding that the â€œpresident is still focused on long term economic fundamentalsâ€?.Senator Sasse wasnâ€™t the only Republican in Congress who was plainly upset. Republican senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said, â€œEvery time you do this, you get a retaliation and agriculture is the No. 1 target.â€?House Speaker Paul Ryan said through a spokesman he hoped Mr Trump would â€œconsider the unintended consequences of this idea and look at other approaches before moving forwardâ€?. Mr Trump met with more than a dozen executives, including representatives from US. Steel Corp., Arcelor Mittal, Nucor, JW Aluminum and Century Aluminum. The industry leaders urged Mr Trump to act, saying they had been unfairly hurt by a glut of imports.â€œWe are not protectionist. We want a level playing field,â€? said Dave Burritt, president and chief executive officer at US Steel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Automotive manufacturer Tesla announced on Tuesday that it has signed an agreement to open its first overseas factory in Shanghai, as a trade war between the U.S. and China continues to escalate.'Last year, we announced that we were working with the Shanghai Municipal Government to explore the possibility of establishing a factory in the region to serve the Chinese market. Today, we have signed a Cooperative Agreement for Tesla to start building Gigafactory 3, a new electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Shanghai,' a Tesla spokesperson told Newsweek.Billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk, 47, plans to significantly expand his manufacturing operations, setting up his second plant in the Asian nationâ€™s top commercial hub. The new facility will be capable of producing 500,000 vehicles annually for Chinese consumers, South China Morning Post reported.Muskâ€™s lone California Tesla factory is currently on track to produce less than 200,000 vehicles in 2018, despite promises of rolling out 500,000 there as well. However, the announcement of the new Shanghai facility comes just after the manufacturer significantly hiked prices of its vehicles in China in response to growing trade tensions.In the wake of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration, China increased import duties on U.S.-made vehicles to 40 percent last week.WANG ZHAO/AFP/Getty ImagesTesla is the first U.S. automaker to respond to trade tensions between Washington and Beijing after raising prices of its Model X and S vehicles by about 20 percent in China, Reuters reported. The companyâ€™s basic Model S sedan now costs $128,779 in China, a price about 70 percent higher than in the U.S. where it starts at $74,500.Although some suggest Teslaâ€™s new factory will help it sell vehicles at more affordable prices to Chinese consumers, production in Shanghai is still a long way off.â€œWe expect construction to begin in the near future, after we get all the necessary approvals and permits. From there, it will take roughly two years until we start producing vehicles and then another two to three years before the factory is fully ramped up,â€? the company told Newsweek in a statement.Despite the years-long wait before Chinese production will commence, Teslaâ€™s stock prices surged by nearly 3 percent after the news broke, Bloomberg reported. Overall, the company is up 3.7 percent in 2018.The news from Tesla also comes after Chinaâ€™s government moved to relax regulations regarding ownership of foreign companies back in April. Previously, international ventures had to link up with local Chinese partners in order to set up their businesses in the country. Due to the relaxed regulations, Teslaâ€™s new manufacturing hub will be fully foreign owned.Tesla also announced that it will reveal plans toward the end of the year to build a new plant in Europe moving forward, Bloomberg reported. Like China, Europe has been caught in the crosshairs of Trumpâ€™s trade policies.GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty ImagesEconomists have warned that the presidentâ€™s trade war will lead to U.S. companies moving more of their operations overseas.Linda Lim, a professor of international business strategy at the Stephen Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, told Newsweek last month that some American manufacturers will move abroad to avoid paying more for raw materials.For example, Harley Davidson Inc. announced in June that it would move production of motorcycles shipped to the EU overseas, estimating that the tariffs would cost the company between $90 million and $100 million per year. Boeing, which is generally the largest U.S. exporter, could make a similar move to that of Harley, Lim suggested.However, Tesla told Newsweek that it does not have plans of changing its current U.S. operations. 'Todayâ€™s announcement will not impact our U.S. manufacturing operations, which continue to grow,' a spokesperson said.â€œThere is no way Trump's tariffs on the EU and China could benefit the U.S. economically,â€? Lim said. â€œNote these costs to American consumers, workers and businesses occur whether or not there is foreign retaliation against American exports.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US tariffs on Chinese imports took effect on Friday at 4:00 a.m. GMT amid concerns of international investors and businesses. China has imposed a 25% tax on $34 billion worth of US goods in response to the similar move by Washington.'China promised not to fire the first shot, but in order to defend the core interests of the country and interests of the people, we are forced to take necessary countermeasures,' China's Commerce Ministry was quoted by AFP in a statement.'The United States has violated WTO rules and launched the largest trade war in economic history to date,' China's Commerce Ministry's statement as quote by AFP. 'This type of tariff levying is typical trade bullying, and seriously jeopardizes the security of the global industrial chain and value chain, hindering the pace of global economic recovery and triggering global market turmoil,' the statement stressed.The US Tariffs on Chinese exports will aplly to engines, motors, construction and farming machinery, electric transportation, telecom equipment and various precision instruments. Counter measures by China will reportedly hit US agricultural commodities, vehicles and aquatic products. Soybeans are the country's biggest import from the United States in terms of value, Reuters reported.Morgan Stanley has reportedly estimated that world trade could be seriously affected as two-thirds of goods traded are linked to global supply chains.Hong Kong shares slumped in the morning session on Friday as US tariffs on Chinese imports took effect, marking the start of US President Donald Trump's trade war with China, AFP reported.According to Reuters, the Shanghai Composite index, which recently tumbled into correction territory, fell 0.3 percent during morning trading.The US Chamber of Commerce said earlier this week that retaliation from China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union in response to Donald Trump's tariffs was already affecting nearly $75 billion in US Exports, AFP reported.In June, Trump said he asked the US Trade Representative to come up with $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to be included in the 10-percent tariffs list. The US presiden also warned that he would pursue tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese products if China again responds to US duties.Trump said he made the decision after China announced retaliatory tariffs on $50 billion worth of US products on June 15. China's reciprocal move came in response to Trump's announcement earlier that same day that the United States would impose 25-percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese technology.The situation in global trade significantly escalated after Donald Trump introduced a 25-percent tariff on steel imports and a 10-percent tariff on aluminum imports in March. Tensions further sharpened when he extended these duties to the European Union, Canada, and Mexico, who were temporarily exempted from the measures.The US moves have prompted worldwide outrage. China, India, the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Norway and Russia have since lodged complaints with the WTO against the restrictive measures imposed by Washington.Sputnik",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wednesday, March 14, 2018 at 7:39PMThis article first appeared in Truthdig.As Jonathan Swift once noted: â€œThere is nothing constant in this world but inconsistency.â€?Thatâ€™s the operative motto for all things Trump, one that makes analyzing the gap between what he thinks and what he tweets much easier. Along those lines, my former boss from my Goldman Sachs daysâ€”Gary Cohnâ€”just resigned from his White House post as chief economic adviser to the Chaos Producer in Chief. This was ostensibly in protest against the presidentâ€™s announcement about imposing steel and aluminum tariffs. The next day, Trump signed the order sealing that deal, citing his actions as a â€œmatter of necessity for our security.â€?Along the way, he said there would be no exemptions to the tariffs, then said there would beâ€”for Canada and Mexico. Trump glowed in the light of his new-found power grab over trade agreements, leaving himself room to decide which countries would be â€œinâ€? and â€œoutâ€? with respect to these and other tariffs in the future. And that was the week that was in Trump World.The timing of Cohnâ€™s departure certainly put a wrench in his plans to convene executives dependent on steel and present their case against steel tariffs to Trump. Instead, Trump signed the tariffs order flanked by steel and aluminum workers supporting it. Speaking of steel, Cohnâ€™s nerves were seemingly made of that metal. At Goldman, he was the man who regularly waded through deals without losing his cool (unlike Trump). On 9/11, I witnessed him directing traders to keep trading oil as shreds of debris and billows of smoke engulfed the windows of the Goldman trading floor, only a few blocks away from the World Trade Center.He became president (or number two) at Goldman, continually handling the less â€œcoolâ€? behavior of chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who remained above him in the pecking order for decades. Cohn commanded daily activities at Goldman that led to the firmâ€™s creation of shady financial instruments that were later at the core of the financial crisis. Under Cohn, Goldman was bailed out by U.S. taxpayers. The firm morphed, for government subsidy purposes, into a bank holding company, though it handled scant deposits from regular people. It did this to retain access to Federal Reserve support, as it has done, over the past decade. Cohn was also at Goldman when it reached a $5 billion settlement with the Department of Justice over its consistent misconduct regarding mortgage-related securities from 2005 to 2007.That type of conflict-meets-crisis readied him for his government service. When Cohn came up against Trump, the presidentâ€™s flavor-of-the-minute trade policy hawk, Peter Navarro, met â€œGlobalist Garyâ€? head on. Shortly therafter, Cohnâ€™s Trump administration career was over.The financial news media didnâ€™t take Cohnâ€™s departure well. Past transgressions forgotten completely, it considered Cohn, one of the few adults in the room, another Trump appointee biting the dust, pointing to what we already know: Inconsistency is the only constant in this White House.The TariffsWhen Trump added imported steel and aluminum to his list of already announced tariffs for solar panels and washing machines, members of his own party joined the world in expressing their disapproval. Many business sectors reliant on raw steel expressed fears that the tariffs would ultimately lead to major job losses, not gains, throughout that U.S. economy. Though the action invoked Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, the rest of the world knows that imported steel costs donâ€™t represent security risks, whereas the alienation of allies actually does.As European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said: â€œWe strongly regret this step, which appears to represent a blatant intervention to protect U.S. domestic industry and not to be based on any national security justification.â€? He vowed that Europe would retaliate.There were three sets of tariffs proposed by the Commerce Department, run by billionaire Wilbur Ross, and the latest, a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports, are the harshest so far. For the president to circumvent Congress on tariffs, it must allegedly alleviate what would otherwise be a national security risk. Thatâ€™s just the loophole Trump used to ostensibly deliver on his campaign promises to American steelworkers. The problem is that the tariffs could wind up hurting those and other workers, as well as American consumers, instead. It would also add fuel to the fire in an already existing trade war.Why is it already existing? Because Trumpâ€™s entire isolationist posture and dogma have already caused U.S. allies and adversaries to seek tighter relationships with each other, from a currency and trade agreement perspective. The latest tariffs are another element on the path away from diplomacy (which could be better used to create agreements that truly benefit workers on all sides of our borders) and toward the school-yard bullying tactics Trump adheres to.Reactions from around the world were of anger. Chinaâ€™s foreign ministrycalled the tariffs â€œunreasonable and excessiveâ€? and, in true trade war style, promised that Beijing â€œwill take necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.â€?Our friend to the north, Canada, one of the biggest sources of steel for the U.S., and one of biggest buyers of American steel, was equally incensed. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum would be â€œabsolutely unacceptable.â€?Even if Trump meant well (OK, a really big IF), his lack of diplomacy will ultimately render products the U.S. must import more expensive. As for American steel, any money made on extra tariffs will be lost on a reduced pool of buyers for our exported products. Domestic consumers ranging from home to bridge builders will inevitably face higher raw steel prices as a result.Tariff Timing and Mexicoâ€™s Stance Affecting NAFTA TalksBefore Trump decided to levy the tariffs, conversations between the U.S. and its NAFTA partners, Mexico and Canada, were coming along, not perfectly, but well enough. Then, the subject of the border wall resurfaced during a phone conversation between Trump and Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto. That stalemate continues. PeÃ±a Nieto reiterated that Mexico wonâ€™t pay for the wall. Trump â€œinsisted that it would.â€? According to The Washington Post, an involved Mexican official said that the entire conversation sparked Trumpâ€™s temper. Surprise, surprise. Trumpâ€™s ongoing temper tantrums are a real chip at the wall of international diplomacy.It was following that heated discourse (after which PeÃ±a Nieto canceled his trip to the U.S., the second time he has done so due to the wall dispute), Trump declared he would impose the tariffs.Whether a negotiation technique, or a campaign promise confirmed to his base, Trump initially implied that the tariffs were aimed at China (from which the U.S. imports less than 6 percent of its steel). But they hurt Canada the most. Canada provides 16 percent of U.S. imported steel. Brazil and South Korea rank second and third. China isnâ€™t even one of Americaâ€™s top 10 suppliers. Worse for Canada, 75 percent of our northern friendâ€™s total steel exports go to the U.S. The tariff would cripple one of Canadaâ€™s leading exports while we are trying to negotiate the â€œbestâ€? NAFTA deal with them.But thatâ€™s exactly what Trump wants. By dangling financial threats and then taking them away, he elevates himself to being more of a dictator, and less of a leader, of the countryâ€™s trade agenda. On Monday, he tweeted that he might consider dropping the tariff on Canada and Mexico if they played ball with him on the new NAFTA agreement. Trumpâ€™s notion of reciprocity at that time meant Mexico paying for a wall and Canada â€œtreating our farmers better.â€? Navarro, director of the White House National Trade Council, had said something different earlier that morning, but the mismatch between Trumpâ€™s tweets and people trying to do their jobs in perpetual guess mode as to his decision is par for the course.All manner of diverse voices called out the tariffs. Goldman Sachs noted that â€œimport tariffs make the U.S. less competitive by raising the prices of raw materials.â€?In Hamburg, Juncker responded to Trumpâ€™s announcement with: â€œWe can also do stupid.â€? He vowed to fight back against Trumpâ€™s tariffs, noting, â€œThis is basically a stupid process, the fact that we have to do this. But we have to do it. We will now impose tariffs on motorcycles, Harley Davidson, on blue jeans, Levis, on bourbon. We can also do stupid. We also have to be this stupid.â€?Trump retorted with an uppercut to the jaw. â€œIf the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S.,â€? he tweeted on Saturday. â€œThey make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!â€?Perhaps, just perhaps, competition for stupid isnâ€™t in the interest of the U.S., other countries, or the workers and citizens of the world. Destroying U.S. credibility only reduces the desire of other countries to buy from the U.S., or to negotiate better terms for U.S. consumers or workers, and instead, trade more with each other.Trade War CasualtiesItâ€™s not rocket science. If it costs more to import steel, either that cost will be passed on to the end user of steel-made products and to middlemen that build things using steel, or U.S. steel manufacturers will step up to the demand that comes from less imported steel.The part of U.S. industry that uses steel is far larger than that which supplies steel. The ratio is more than 6.5 million workers to about 140,000 in the steel industry itself. And sure, as billionaire U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross pointed out, if a Campbellâ€™s soup can uses 2.6 cents worth of steel, and if that steel cost rises by 25 percent, it adds only an extra six-tenths of one cent to the canâ€™s price.But that math doesnâ€™t account for whether American companies can accommodate extra domestic steel demand, or whether they will also now raise steel pricesâ€”because they can. The U.S. has been behind in infrastructure surrounding the steel industry, one of the reasons U.S. steel mills have been at over, not under, capacity. Renovating mills would enable domestic steel producers to produce more steel for domestic use than raising tariffs on importing steel would.When the Bush steel tariff was in effect in 2002, 200,000 Americans in industries requiring steel lost their jobs because of higher steel prices, versus 187,500 workers working in the steel industry. The reality is that there needs to be better infrastructure.The Trade DeficitTrumpâ€™s use of tariffs as a means to control trade deficits comes after his first year in office, during which the overall U.S. trade deficit widened 12.1 percent to $566 billion, its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. Exports rose 5.5 percent to $2.33 trillion, while imports climbed 6.7 percent to a record $2.9 trillion. The trade gap with China increased 8.1 percent to a record $375.2 billion, and the gap with Mexico rose to $71.1 billion, the second highest on record.According to the Department of Commerceâ€™s International Trade Administration, the U.S. is the worldâ€™s largest steel importer, with U.S. imports representing about 8 percent of all steel imported globally. Part of the reason for that is not just the price of steel, but the ability of U.S. steel companies to produce it in the U.S. The top eight countries that export steel to the U.S. provide about 1 million metric tons each and make up 75 percent of U.S. steel imports. Canada, Brazil and Mexico send more than a third of their total steel exports to the U.S.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tried to assuage fears of global trade wars at a congressional committee hearing, saying, â€œWe are not looking to get into trade wars.â€? He added that he was â€œsupportiveâ€? of imposing the duties, thereby contradicting himself, taking a page out of Trumpâ€™s book of bipolarity and reducing the legitimacy of anything the U.S. government says or does.House Speaker Paul Ryan has also expressed repeated concerns about a trade war. Yet our internal dramas just serve to alienate us from the world, not obtain better overall â€œdeals,â€? because we are doing so from a position of increasing weakness and erratic White House behavior.1920s Isolationism and TariffsU.S. history during an equally isolationist and deregulatory period shows that alienating the world doesnâ€™t help the U.S.â€”or the world. The Emergency Tariff Act, signed in May 1921, increased import taxes on wheat, sugar, meat, wool and other agricultural products.The Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act, signed in September 1922, raised tariffs and extended them to industrial goods. The tariffs did encourage Americans to buy American goods. However, they did not help U.S. exports. Other countries retaliated by introducing tariffs of their own, so U.S. exports became more expensive and less popular.In 1930, following the crash of 1929, President Hoover signed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, against, raising already high tariffs on more than 20,000 imported goods to as much as 60 percent. That set off a global trade war, causing more trading partner retaliation, and a 66 percent drop in global trade between 1929 and 1934 that deepened the Great Depression. To lower the high tariffs, President Roosevelt passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934.Why Mexico MattersMeanwhile, the seventh round of NAFTA talks between Mexico, Canada and the U.S. finished in Mexico City this week, three weeks before Mexicoâ€™sâ€™ campaign season begins on March 30. Jared Kushner flew to Mexico City, having lost his security clearance and thus ability to negotiate world peace in the Middle East. Whether he had anything to do with it or not, the next day, Trump did relent, and agree to exempt Mexico and Canada from tariffs. That said, he could easily re-impose them if talk about a wall or other conversation goes against his demands.A trade war is about more than prices in and prices out. Itâ€™s about considering how those prices impact real people and jobs. Itâ€™s about considering multiple trade and diplomatic relationshipsâ€”not just between other countries and the U.S., but among those countries with each other.Trumpâ€™s supporters may believe that drawing a line in the sand against China that impacts Canada is good for American jobs, but the devil is in the details, and details are not Trumpâ€™s forte. The reality is that America is losing its position on the world stage as a country that shows consistency in any capacity. These tariffs will inspire better trade relationships among other countries, something Trumpâ€™s isolationist stance has already put in motion. They will diminish U.S. credibility, the lack of which is a product Trump has coined as his main export.In the 1930s, U.S.-initiated trade wars contributed to a global Great Depression, one factor that lead to World War II. This time around, the rest of the world is more likely to work together and less with the U.S., not quake in economic fear of U.S. retaliation. This is clear and evidenced by the recent agreement between Japan and the EU, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, in which Japan and China are key participants, their historical differences set aside, in efforts to forge non-U.S. trade relationships.The U.S. remains in a precarious economic situation, as does the world, and that means Trumpâ€™s trade war and nationalism, coupled with bank deregulation, could inflict more risk on depleted economies. That path would be a truly disastrous one for the U.S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"â€œIf I was a US farmer, Iâ€™d be very cranky with Donald Trumpâ€?.Thatâ€™s National Farmersâ€™ Federation (NFF) President Fiona Simsonâ€™s understatement, made after the US President launched his second significant trade salvo is as many weeks; this time directed at the booming Chinese agricultural export market.But Ms Simson says bad news for US agriculture on the back of Donald Trumpâ€™s burgeoning trade wars also represents good opportunity to enhance exports for Australian farmers.Mr Trumpâ€™s announcement late last week that about US$60 billion worth of tariffs would be slammed on Chinese imports arrived shortly after he revealed a 25pc tax on imported steel and a 10pc on aluminium.That move sparked angry backlash and immediate calls to reverse the Presidentâ€™s protectionist policies, for fear of being stranded in the cross fire of a tit-for-tat trade war, from American farmers.But on Friday, Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Commerce announced a list of 128 tariff measures on US farm imports, amounting to about US$3b, in retaliation to the steel and aluminium tariffs.While the US$3b is not seen as being overly significant in terms of the overall trade volume between the two countries at about US500b, a spokesperson said the list targets US farm exports like fresh and dried fruit, pork and pork products, wine and nuts, that now face reciprocal Chinese taxes of 15pc and 25pc.Fears have also been expressed by US grain farming leaders that soybeans will be in the firing line of the new tariff wall Mr Trump announced against China late last week with wheat and corn also set to suffer.American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall said if the trade situation continued to deteriorate, â€œour lives as farmers and ranchers will become more difficultâ€?.He said Americaâ€™s farmers and ranchers exported more than US$20b of farm products to China â€“ more than 15pc of all US agricultural exports.â€œAfter Canada, China is our second-largest customer for ag exports,â€? he said.â€œIn retaliation for what our government says are justified US trade measures against China on intellectual property issues, Chinese officials now have indicated they are prepared to slap tariffs on US pork, wine and fruit.â€œOur farmers and ranchers depend on trade for a living and we are very concerned about retaliation resulting from the tariffs.â€œChina is an important market for US pork, and with about US$1b worth of it going to China and Hong Kong, itâ€™s our second-biggest market.â€œThis will really hurt US pork producers.â€?Mr Duvall said farm income across commodities had fallen by about 50pc over the past four years and retaliation in the trade arena â€œmakes our outlook even worseâ€?.â€œThis could not be happening at a worse time for American agriculture,â€? he said.â€œWe expect all countries to trade fairly and we support enforcement of trade rules.â€œBut we also hope trade disputes can be resolved without harming an industry that is a bright spot on trade and is so important to rural America.â€?China is Australiaâ€™s largest agricultural export market valued at $10.3b in 2016 which has climbed from $6.6b in 2011 led by wine, wool, beef, grains, dairy and sheep and goat meat with those exports boosted by tariff cuts in the free trade agreement that came into play in late 2015.Ms Simson said the US was one of Australiaâ€™s biggest export competitors in major farm commodities like beef and when they pulled out of trade deals like the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) - recently re-signed among the 11 remaining countries including Australia â€“ or imposed tariff barriers on China, it had an upside for local exports.â€œThe very fact that Australian farmers have access to markets, at competitive tariffs, in some cases better than the access thatâ€™s available for some of our biggest competitors, it does mean good things for Australian farmers,â€? she said.â€œThe NFF position on trade is that we should have a level playing field throughout the world when it comes to trade so we welcome competition from the US and we welcome the US coming into markets and opening up markets and we believe opening free trade is the best way to proceed.â€œHowever, it we have preferential access to some of the worldâ€™s biggest markets and US farmers are unable to access those markets, then certainly our farmers will reap some rewards and receive benefits that are not there for US farmers.â€œAsia is one of our biggest markets and the proximity of Asia to Australia makes it one of our preferential markets.â€œTo be able to negotiate lower tariffs into markets like Japan for our red meat, through the TPP, those sorts of arrangements are not open to the US farmers.â€œSo if I was a US farmer, Iâ€™d be very cranky with Donald Trump.â€?Ms Simson said in contrast, the Australian government was doing a â€œgreat jobâ€? in terms of opening up markets.â€œAustralian agriculture is very export dependent â€“ we do need access to markets and we donâ€™t have enough population to sustain our own agricultural industry,â€? she said.â€œWe do a great job of feeding people throughout the world and they love our products because of the provenance and quality of our products so we need to have markets and doors opened to be able to sell those products.â€œAnd if we can do so in a way thatâ€™s preferential to our biggest competitors like the US, thatâ€™s a win for Australian farmers.â€?US farmer backlashThe US Wheat Associates and National Association of Wheat Growers (NAWG) said they understood the need to enforce international trade rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) but â€œwe are very concernedâ€? about the implications of the Trump Administrationâ€™s decision to impose more than $60b in tariffs on Chinese goods.â€œRecent actions including withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and implementing steel and aluminium tariffs on the basis of national security have already undermined US leadership in international trade,â€? a statement said.â€œNow this action further erodes historical support for rules-based trade policies, even though China will likely bring a case against the tariffs within the WTO dispute settlement process.â€œIn addition, USW and NAWG fear that applying unilateral tariffs could invite retaliation that, as recent history shows, would be aimed at US agricultural products.â€œThis could very well include China throwing up road blocks to US soybeans, wheat, corn and other commodity imports, which would cut into already unsustainable farm incomes.â€œWe welcome the administrationâ€™s strong support for enforcing trade rules.â€œWe only wish it would have challenged Chinaâ€™s state-driven policies in ways that complied with and strengthened existing trade rules. â€œGrainGrowers market analyst Luke Mathews said currently there was zero Australian soybean exports to China but canola is exported as a soybean substitute.He said China had historically been an important market for Australian canola but the European Union had dominated in recent years.â€œThere is much excitement that the China-US dispute will further strengthen Aust-China grain trade relationships, particularly for sorghum and barley,â€? he said.â€œChina is already Australiaâ€™s most valuable grain trading partner, and the general feeling from the past few days in China is that both sides have a commitment to further strengthen this relationship.â€?Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Donald Trump had indicated last weekâ€™s tariffs on China were the beginning of a negotiation.â€œHis contention is that trade should be fair and reciprocal - we understand that - that is the reason why Australia has been exempted from the steel tariffs,â€? he said.â€œAs Donald Trump said, trade between Australia and the US is fair and reciprocal with zero tariffs on US imports into Australia.â€œWe have a very close security relationship and America actually has trade surplus with Australia and we donâ€™t complain about that.â€œWeâ€™ve got surpluses with other countries.â€œSo the important thing is no one wins in a trade war, no doubt about that.â€œWe look forward the US and China to being able to negotiate a satisfactory arrangement that suits both sides.â€?Mr Turnbull said Australiaâ€™s focus should be on supporting good constructive negotiations.â€œPresident Trump has talked about how much he respects President Xi,â€? he said.â€œI have been with them and the two men see eye-to-eye in every respect â€“ they are about the same height, both big guys â€“ and I look forward to them being able to negotiate.â€œBut I donâ€™t want to speculate on actions that havenâ€™t been announced.â€œWeâ€™ve got a free trade agreement with China which has been very important for agriculture.â€œWeâ€™ve seen a massiveâ€¦64pc increase in wine exports alone to China since the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement came into play.â€?Mr Turnbull said other markets had opened up through a free trade agreement with Peru recently and the TPP while a free trade agreement with Indonesia was also being worked on and one with the European Union.â€œAll of these things are hard by the way. Free trade agreements, itâ€™s not an easy glide path and you have setbacks, there are hills and hollows in the road you pursue,â€? he said.â€œBut my job as Prime Minister is to make sure that I create the best opportunities for Australian businesses to export, because that means they invest and that means they create more jobs.â€?Mr Turnbull said through the TPP on beef alone Australia had a competitive advantage against US ranchers with a â€œmuch lower tariffsâ€?.â€œIt is my job as Prime Minister to fling open as many doors for Australian exports as I can,â€? he said.â€œThose that are open, get them open even more, because we are the best.â€œWe can compete on the biggest, broadest playing fields around the world (in agriculture) to ensure we can produce the food we require and to take advantage of those opportunities.â€?Does this article interest you?

"The move is likely to be met with retaliatory action from China and could further rattle stock markets and raise fears of higher consumer prices in China and the U.S.The proposed new tariffs amount to $12.5 billion on about $50 billion in goods. They would affect hundreds of China-made products such as semiconductors, car and aircraft parts and machine tools.Even so, some economists see the tit-for-tat actions and increasing rhetoric on both sides as brinkmanship leading to possible direct talks that could still prevent a trade conflict from spinning out of control.Trumpâ€™s latest tariffs would take effect in June at the earliest and are meant to punish China for intellectual property theft. They would follow Trumpâ€™s move last month to impose stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum from China and some other nations, and an earlier action to levy penalties on Chinese solar panels.China responded Monday to the steel tariffs with its own duties on $3 billion of U.S. pork, dried fruit and steel pipes. And anticipating the upcoming batch of new tariffs, Chinaâ€™s ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai, said that Beijing is prepared to meet them eye for eye.â€œWe will certainly take countermeasures, of the same proportion, and the same scale, same intensity,â€? Cui said in remarks broadcast on Chinese state television Tuesday.But even as both sides ramp up the pressure, there are signs that talks between the two economic rivals are continuing and that some concessions from China may be enough to launch formal negotiations and forestall a trade war.â€œI would say the pattern being established is that if trade partners make small concessions that the administration can trumpet, that seems to be sufficient,â€? said David Dollar, a senior fellow in the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution.But he added: â€œIâ€™m certain China will retaliate in some way, as they always have. The risk is, if the administration rolls out more measures and peopleâ€™s egos get involved, and it ratchets up from there, then it starts to become significant for the U.S. economy.â€?Trump on Tuesday again suggested that his tariffs are meant to pressure Beijing to come to the table and make concessions.â€œWeâ€™ll be working with China, weâ€™ll be negotiating with China,â€? Trump said, repeating his â€œgreat respectâ€? for Chinese President Xi Jinping.â€œWe intend to get along with China, but we have to do something very substantialâ€? on trade, Trump said.In the past the president also has said that he would be willing to cut China some slack on trade if Xi helped put more economic pressure on North Korea to rein in its nuclear program. In May, Trump is planning to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in an unprecedented summit.â€œI think Xi is in a stronger position,â€? said Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, referring to Xiâ€™s recent meeting with Kim in Beijing and the implications from their restored relations. The Chinese president â€œnow has a working relationship with Kim,â€? Lardy said, â€œand implicitly the threat must be, â€˜If you put all those tariffs on us, weâ€™re not going to cooperate with shutting down North Korea economically.â€™â€?Whatâ€™s more, skeptics note that Trump has backed down from his fiery rhetoric before. He declined to label China a currency manipulator as he had promised he would during the campaign.More recently, after vowing to slap across-the-board steel tariffs on all U.S. importers, he exempted most of the largest players. And he accepted a surprisingly modest rewrite of the U.S.-South Korea trade deal, after long bashing that agreement as â€œhorrible.â€?Chinaâ€™s Cui argued Tuesday that China is already responding to U.S. concerns, strengthening protection and enforcement of U.S. intellectual property. â€œWe are making progress,â€? he said.But in a 215-page report, the Trump administration detailed Chinaâ€™s long practice of pressuring U.S. firms to turn over technology and trade secrets, and in some cases stealing intellectual property by using cybertheft and other forms of industrial espionage.That finding, under Section 301 of a 1974 U.S. trade law, gives the president wide discretion to impose tariffs and take other actions to remedy the problem. Separately, Trumpâ€™s Treasury Department is readying rules that would restrict Chinese investments in the U.S.Now that the list has been released, it is likely to trigger an onslaught of additional lobbying from corporate interests. Already some of the nationâ€™s largest firms such as General Electric, as well as farming and industry groups, were urging the White House not to escalate, worried that the actions will ultimately hurt American companiesâ€™ global supply chains and their sales in China.The Section 301 tariffs would not take effect immediately. There would be a one-month period of public comments, and a hearing has been scheduled for May 15, before a final list is adopted. The tariffs would have to be implemented by mid-August under Section 301.In releasing the list of 1,300 items, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the total value of imports subject to the tariffs â€œis commensurate with an economic analysis of the harm caused by Chinaâ€™s unreasonable technology transfer policies to the U.S. economy.â€?Lighthizer said previously that the items were being selected on the basis of what would have the biggest effect on China and the smallest hit on U.S. consumers.The Section 301 tariffs include many products such as aerospace parts and machine tools that are imported by California businesses. And add to that Mondayâ€™s announced Chinese retaliatory tariffs on California agricultural products, and the overall effect of the trade conflict could be particularly painful for the state.China buys billions of dollars of soybeans from the United States, but Chinese imports of the American product â€” important for a swath of states in the Midwest â€” have slowed so far this year amid rising trade tensions with the U.S. After Trump imposed tariffs on imports of solar panels, Beijing responded by initiating an investigation into U.S. sorghum imports.And the steel and aluminum tariffs by the U.S. were met with 15 percent tariffs on 120 U.S. imports to China, such as fresh fruits, nuts and wine, and 25 percent tariffs on eight products worth about $2 billion, including U.S. pork and recycled aluminum.â€œThis is just signaling intention rather than upsetting the global economic apple cart,â€? said Claire Reade, senior counsel at Arnold & Porter and an assistant U.S. trade representative for China affairs in the Obama administration. â€œSo the real question is: What happens next?â€? she said of the impending Section 301 tariffs.For domestic political considerations and bargaining leverage, she said, â€œitâ€™s going to be critical for China to appear strong, (and) because of that, China is not going to turn the other cheek. It is not going to take this lying down.â€?John Frisbie, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, a group representing 200 large American companies doing business in China, said, â€œChina needs to substantially improve market access and competitive conditions for American companies selling to and investing in China in certain sectors, but unilateral tariffs may do more harm than good and do little to address the problems in Chinaâ€™s IP and tech transfer policies.â€?Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the tariffs are â€œlikely to create new challenges in the form of significant added costs for manufacturers and American consumers.â€?U.S. stocks, which had been rising in after-market trading, sunk into negative territory after the list was released Tuesday evening.Even if Trump follows through and implements new Section 301 tariffs and Beijing responds in like manner, the overall figures involved would still amount to a fraction of the $630 billion in trade between the two countries. Chinaâ€™s total exports to the U.S. account for only about 3 percent of that countryâ€™s economy.â€œI donâ€™t know that we have enough leverage,â€? Reade said. â€œChina does not need the U.S. market badly enough to turn into a market economy.â€?Even so, Reade and other trade and economic experts can only speculate how far Trump will go to force China to change its state-controlled and aggressive economic policies. Businesses and markets are nervous in part because Trump has not let up in railing against Chinese economic behavior and the large U.S. trade deficit.Also, a recent reshuffling of his Cabinet has shifted the balance in the White House to a more hard-line posture. His top trade and economic officials such as Lighthizer and trade advisor Peter Navarro have similarly visceral reactions to Chinaâ€™s mercantilism as the president, viewing the Asian giant nation as an economic adversary and serious threat to Americaâ€™s long-run prosperity and national security.Wendy Cutler, who has led trade negotiations for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama and is vice president at think tank Asia Society, thinks that Trump could be placated if Beijing offered a deficit-reducing package and structural reforms â€” with a timeline, milestones and some down payment.For now, thereâ€™s at least a two-month window before the new tariffs take effect, she said, and the two sides appear to be continuing to talk.â€œCommunication is going on, and thatâ€™s encouraging. Markers are being put down,â€? she said. â€œIs there enough on the table that could result in negotiations? Itâ€™s too early to tell.â€?â€”â€”â€”Â©2018 Los Angeles TimesVisit Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In return, the EU will make unspecified purchases of U.S. soybeans and liquefied natural gas, the president said.After a White House meeting, the two men also vowed to work toward eliminating all tariffs on many industrial goods, a resumption of dialogue that could help repair fractured relations between the longtime allies.â€œThis is a positive development for Ohio and our economy,â€? U.S. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said. â€œAddressing the EUâ€™s tariff and non-tariff barriers helps create the level playing field for American workers and companies that I have consistently called for. I look forward to seeing the fruits of these negotiations and support efforts that move other countries towards greater trade reciprocity with the United States.â€?Even the limited deal was welcome news to those concerned that Trumpâ€™s trade policies are causing instability and uncertainty for the global economy. The U.S. and EU have a $1 trillion bilateral trade relationship, the largest in the world. Stock futures surged Wednesday afternoon on news of the agreement, despite the lack of details or firm commitments.Just days after Trump called the EU a â€œfoeâ€? on trade, he spoke of the â€œclose friendshipâ€? with the 28-nation pact and predicted a â€œnew phase in the relationship between the United States and European Union.â€?Trump said neither side would impose new tariffs as long as talks continued.In addition to dropping his threat to impose 20 percent tariffs on imported autos and auto parts, Trump promised to â€œresolve the steel and aluminum tariff issues.â€? Trump earlier this year imposed steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, which prompted the countertariffs from the EU.As part of the deal, Europe promised to buy an unspecified amount of U.S. soybeans and build more terminals to import liquefied natural gas. More soybean purchases, which Trump said would start â€œalmost immediately,â€? would bring relief to farmers in politically key states who have been hurt by retaliatory tariffs, especially from China. On Tuesday, Trump announced a $12 billion aid program to help American farmers hurt by Trumpâ€™s trade war with China.Juncker said Europe looked forward to bolstering cooperation with the U.S. on energy. â€œThis is also a message for others,â€? he said, an apparent reference to Europeâ€™s current reliance on Russian energy imports.â€œI had the intention to make a deal today,â€? Juncker said. â€œAnd we made a deal today.â€?Analysts described the meeting as moderately successful, especially given the low expectations on both sides of the Atlantic.â€œJuncker didnâ€™t come to reset relations or to have some massive 2.0 (trade) plan,â€? said Bart Oosterveld, director of global business and economic programs at the Atlantic Council. â€œHis mandate was to stop the bleeding, and thatâ€™s what may have happened.â€?Philip I. Levy, senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, said the early reports from the meeting sounded â€œjust like the kind of agreement reached with China last year â€” some purchase promises and a pledge to talk more.â€?â€œIn Chinaâ€™s case, that led to trade war, not trade peace,â€? Levy said. â€œThe warming of relations and any delay in additional protection would be welcome, but this does not seem like a lasting solution to the presidentâ€™s tweeted concerns.â€?Trump has repeatedly complained about the EUâ€™s merchandise trade surplus of about $150 billion with the United States, and in particular has targeted Germany and its auto industry. Trump has said the EUâ€™s existing 10 percent tariff on auto imports is unfair in light of the 2.5 percent duty that is assessed by the U.S. The U.S. tariff on imported trucks, however, is 25 percent compared to 10 percent by the EU.The conditional truce with the EU will be welcomed by lawmakers and others in Washington who have worried that the U.S. was alienating allies at a time when it needed them to join together to focus on China and its trade practices.Ahead of Junckerâ€™s visit, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, met with EU trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom on Tuesday. Brady said he told her: â€œWe need to align together to stop China from cheating. We recognize there are other trade winds occurring, but we need to remember we all have the same stake on stopping and confronting China.â€?Whether the EU and the U.S. will now work together on China remains to be seen. As recently as December, the EU, U.S. and Japan agreed to jointly address Chinaâ€™s trade practices. But since then trans-Atlantic ties have been strained further by Trumpâ€™s pullout of the multiparty deal on Iranâ€™s denuclearization and the presidentâ€™s persistent jabs at NATO and EU trade.Trump and Juncker, in saying the two sides would start talks, in a sense agreed to revive free-trade negotiations that were initiated by the Obama administration. But those talks were suspended two years ago and Trump has made no move to advance them.â€œItâ€™s basically the start or renewal of working-level discussions that have been dormant for awhile,â€? said Oosterveld. The outcome of Wednesdayâ€™s meeting, he said, â€œappears to be some easing of tension and resumption of dialogue. Thatâ€™s the silver lining today.â€?As Trump began his meeting Wednesday with Juncker, he stressed the need for â€œa level playing field for our farmers, for our manufacturers, for everybody â€¦ If we could have no tariffs, and no barriers, and no subsidies, the United States would be extremely pleased.â€?Trump had tweeted essentially the same remarks on Tuesday and also said something similar at the conclusion of the G7 leadersâ€™ summit last month in Quebec. And in remarks after his meeting Wednesday, Trump said: â€œThis is why we agreed today, first of all, to work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods.â€?Juncker was more restrained in his remarks, saying: â€œWe have identified a number of areas on which to work together. Work towards zero tariffs on industrial goods. And that was my main intention, to propose to come down to zero tariffs on industrial goods.â€?As a practical matter, trade analysts said, neither Trump nor the EU was likely to be able to deliver on zero tariffs and barriers on all goods. Both sides have sacred cows that are protected from foreign competition and will be politically difficult to overcome, especially agricultural goods in Europe and things like sugar and trucks in the U.S.After imposing so many new tariffs and tweeting on Tuesday that â€œTariffs are the greatest!,â€? experts questioned whether Trump is really after tariff-free trade. What Trump wants are unilateral concessions from trading partners, said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Trumpâ€™s thinking, he said, is that â€œweâ€™ve given and weâ€™ve given for 30 years. Now you concede, I give you nothing.â€?As for why Trump then has called for zero tariffs in recent days, Reinsch said it was to deflect criticism â€” often from his own party â€” that he is a protectionist.â€œItâ€™s a clever move on his part,â€? Reinsch said. â€œIf the EU rejects (Trumpâ€™s call for no tariffs), heâ€™s the free trader and the EU is the protectionist. If they agree to negotiate â€¦ and if they fail to deliver first, Trumpâ€™s also the good guy.â€?â€”â€”â€”Â©2018 Los Angeles TimesVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Grain is unloaded from a bulk carrier ship docked at the Nantong Cereals & Oils Transfer Co. facility at the Port of Nantong in Nantong, China, on June 6, 2018.BEIJING â€“ Some U.S. companies are pulling back investments in equipment and jobs 'as a result of uncertainty over trade policy,' the Federal Reserve warned Thursday, adding that the U.S. clashes with trading partners were already huring the stock market and could also harm overall economic growth.The statement by the Fed, as part of a recap of the U.S. central bank's June meeting, was the latest indication of the high-stakes of President Donald Trump's brewing trade war. The conflict will escalate further Thursday night when U.S. tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports take effect, with Beijing planning to swiftly respond on an equal amount of goods.In its statement, the Fed indicated it planned to continue to gradually raise rates as it seeks to return monetary policy to a more normal state - after years of extraordinary efforts to stimulate growth - but cautioned that it was watching the trade conflict carefully.Most Fed senior officials, the statement said, 'noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending.'Here in Beijing, in response to the U.S. tariffs, border officers here could receive the order as early as midnight to slap new taxes on hundreds of U.S. products, including pork, poultry, soybeans and corn. That would begin an unprecedented commerce battle between the world's two largest economies - a conflict analysts fear could rattle markets, cripple trade, and undermine ties between the United States and China at a time when the administration seeks Beijing's cooperation on North Korea.As the global business community watches the clock, China is moving to pin the fallout on Trump, framing the United States as a bully the Asian nation is forced to confront. A state media editorial this week called the United States' 'dictatorial bent' a global threat, while officials said China will 'absolutely not' take the first swing.'The United States will be opening fire on the whole world and also opening fire on itself,' Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said Thursday.Those measures appear to be aimed at the United States' heartland, which helped lift Trump into the White House. Farmers in the overwhelmingly red Midwest fear they will lose access to China's lucrative market and be left with the bill for excess produce and livestock.What happens next is anyone's guess, analysts say, since both sides have pledged not to back down.'It's a dark day tomorrow for global trade,' predicted JÃ¶rg Wuttke, former president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.Uncertainty hangs over companies, supply chains and investment plans, he said. U.S. firms in China are already reporting spikes in random inspections at ports.One U.S. manufacturer said Chinese authorities on average used to inspect 2 percent of the vehicles it sent abroad. Since June, agents have taken a closer look at every product.'Don't expect the 'war' to be out in the open in some imaginary tit-for-tat tariff battlefield,' said James Zimmerman, a partner in the Beijing office of international law firm Perkins Coie LLP. 'The real battle will be on the flanks' - in the form of unnecessary inspections, product quarantines and heightened regulatory scrutiny.Supply chains will also suffer a blow, said Cliff Tan, East Asian head of global markets research at Japan's MUFG Bank in Hong Kong. The initial set of U.S. tariffs could rock companies in the technology sector and hike the price of 'Walmart-type' products.'It's like a war where everybody points the guns at themselves,' Tan said.The conflict over U.S.-China trade has been brewing for years but has intensified rapidly in 2018. On April 3, the United States released a list of targets for proposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, taking aim at high-tech and industrial goods. On April 4, China fired back.In the months since, the tit for tat has escalated, with the U.S. threatening successive rounds of tariffs on goods valued at hundreds of billions of dollars. China vowed to match U.S. moves, using both quantitative and qualitative measures.Kenneth Jarrett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said that a sense of anxiety has settled over business in the port city.'My hope is that with this start, people will feel that the cost is too great and we will not move on to the second wave,' he said.Thus far, the U.S. president has showed no interest in a last-minute truce. Though he has called Chinese President Xi Jinping a 'good friend,' he has expressed no apprehension over what could happen in either country when the first tariffs land.'Trade wars are good,' Trump recently tweeted, 'and easy to win.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Washington DC â€“ President Trump announced he won the trade war with China. The United States will receive Chinaâ€™s Great Wall. China will see all US tariffs on its goods disappear. Upon the delivery of the Great Wall, it will be placed on the US-Mexico border.Economists note the trade imbalance between the two nations will not change at all. America will still import Chinese steel as it did before the trade war. Other issues such as China disregarding intellectual copyrights were not resolved. The economic conflict did accomplish damaging US businesses that need inexpensive Chines products, however.And Trump got his wall.And itâ€™s a great one.The White House states the Great Wall of China will soon become the Halliburton-Jesus Wall. It will span the entire US-Mexico border. The Trump administration realizes the Great Wall of China is really, really big. Itâ€™s much bigger than the United Statesâ€™ southern border. Whatever Wall is left over is going to be used to encircle crime ridden cities and their Democratic mayors. This way minorities outside the country canâ€™t get in and minorities already inside the country are managed properly.The Chinese government seems happy with thedeal. Many in the Chinese government were initially concerned that such a symbol of national pride would be given away to the Americans. Chinaâ€™s President Xi Jinping assured his followers the US will never get a gram of the Great Wall. The trade agreement explicitly states China will give the US a great wall. They never promised Trump to give him the Great Wall. President Xi Jinping has yet to decide if the wall the Americans will get will be made out of Legos or Lincoln Logs.Despite everything, Trump supporters are celebrating the big win. â€œPresident Trump is a strong negotiator. Weâ€™re getting a big wall to keep Mexicans out, and China is paying for it!â€? exclaimed WWE and Trump super fan Allan â€œButterballâ€? Canard.In unrelated news, the midterm elections canâ€™t get here fast enough.Laughed? How about buying this satirist a coffee?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Share ThisDonald Trump once claimed a trade war with China would be â€œeasyâ€? to win. But consensus is emerging that the president is losing the first battles.His team has been trying to hash out a deal to boost US exports, but multiple rounds of negotiations have yet to yield progress on key priorities, like protection for US intellectual property.Now the conflict has Mr Trump taking fire at home from two sides: those worried he is provoking a damaging trade fight, and those who fear he will give in too easily.Mr Trump, citing a large trade deficit and unfair rules in China, says the US is starting from such a bad position that the country stands to gain no matter what happens.But amid the sound and fury, what, if anything, is actually changing?ZTE politicsThe US last month barred Chinese technology firm ZTE from receiving US exports after the firm failed to comply with a settlement reached after it violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran.Mr Trump, at the request of Chinese President Xi Jinping, said the US would take another look at the penalties. The measures have forced the firm, which relies on US parts to make smart phones and network equipment, to suspend major operations.The two sides are still discussing details, but instead of the ban, the firm is likely to face fines and be required to shake up its ownership.The potential reprieve has prompted critics, including some members of his own party, to accuse Mr Trump of caving in to a company that has raised national security concerns.Some also alleged suspicious timing, pointing to a deal struck between a Chinese-owned company and one of the Trump Organizationâ€™s business partners in Indonesia.US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday denied a quid pro quo and maintained that ZTE discussions are separate from trade talks. He said the punishment was never intended to put the company out of business.While the administration assured that any revised penalty would remain harsh, some politicians said they were considering congressional action to block a reversal.The backlash has nettled the president, who prides himself on his negotiating skills. He took to Twitter to defend his action.Bottom line: The situation remains fluid but the president has paid a political cost for his willingness to spare ZTE.Tariff talkThe US treasury secretary said new tariffs are on hold, while negotiators work out a deal, in which China would purchase more American agriculture and energy products.Mr Trump on Monday said the potential agreement could be â€œone of the best thingsâ€? to happen to farmers, an important part of his base that has been worried about Chinese retaliation.But analysts noted that the joint statement issued at the end of the most recent round of negotiations did not include a target for the increased purchases, despite earlier US claims the increase could amount to as much as $200bn.They say Chinaâ€™s growth would necessitate increased purchases regardless of trade talks.Meanwhile, China made few concessions to the US concerns about intellectual property theft and government subsidies that triggered the stand-off.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who is viewed as being more of a hardliner on China than Mr Mnuchin, and others in the administration have reserved the right to return to tariffs, depending on how the talks go.Existing sanctions, including US tariffs on steel and aluminium and Chinese tariffs on US products such as wine, remain in effect.The tensions within the administration had erupted at earlier talks in Beijing in a widely reported a shouting match between Mr Mnuchin and a more hawkish adviser, Peter Navarro.But while American officials played a good cop-bad cop routine and continued to debate amongst themselves, the Chinese media claimed victory.â€œIn the face of Washingtonâ€™s unreasonable pre-conditions in earlier consultations, Beijing had always returned with resolute responses and had never backed down,â€? one commentary on Chinaâ€™s official media Xinhua read.Bottom line: The tariff dispute remains primarily a war of words â€“ and one the Chinese appear to be winning.Market makingChina last year said it intends to ease restrictions on foreign ownership of financial companies. This spring, regulators said they would relax rules for auto and aircraft makers as well.On Tuesday, Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Finance announced a plan to cut taxes from 25% to 15% for most foreign cars starting July 1, among other measures.Improved access to the Chinese market is a key demand of US negotiators, who say Chinese rules put international firms at a disadvantage. Some companies, such as JP Morgan Chase and Tesla, have already said they are planning to take advantage of the shift.But China, which is worried about the health of its financial sector, started to discuss its intentions last year, before the tensions heated up this spring. Previous promises of openness have disappointed.Bottom line: China appears to be willing to open up certain markets, responding to domestic concerns. Details remain in the works.North Korea gambleThe US-China trade dispute has never been just about trade â€“ the White House also wants Chinaâ€™s help to curb North Korea and its nuclear ambitions.The US launched its probe of Chinese intellectual property practices last summer amid frustration about a series of missile launches.The president is now planning a summit with North Koreaâ€™s leader Kim Jong-un in June, though North Korea has threatened to cancel.Mr Trump has suggested North Koreaâ€™s shift was due to Chinese influence, linking the two sets of talks.Democrat Max Baucus is among those who have said yielding on trade in hope of help with North Korea is a risky strategy.Bottom line: Itâ€™s not clear how the North Korea efforts will evolve.Source: BBC",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Share ThisThe United States and China escalated their acrimonious trade war yesterday, implementing punitive 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of each otherâ€™s goods, even as mid-level officials from both sides resumed talks in Washington.The worldâ€™s two largest economies have now slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on a combined $100 billion of products since early July, with more in the pipeline, adding to risks to global economic growth.Chinaâ€™s Commerce Ministry said Washington was â€œremaining obstinateâ€? by implementing the latest tariffs, which kicked in on both sides as scheduled at 12:01 p.m. in Beijing.â€œChina resolutely opposes this, and will continue to take necessary countermeasures,â€? it said in a brief statement, adding that Beijing will file a complaint over the latest tariffs with the World Trade Organization.The tariffs, scheduled weeks ago, did not interfere with the start of a second day of trade talks in Washington led by Chinese Commerce Vice Minister Wang Shouwen and David Malpass, the U.S. Treasury under secretary for international affairs.Wang, asked by a Reuters reporter how the talks were progressing, declined to comment as he and his delegation entered the U.S. Treasury building on Thursday morning.President Donald Trump has threatened to put duties on almost all of the more than $500 billion of Chinese goods exported to the United States annually unless Beijing agrees to sweeping changes to its intellectual property practices, industrial subsidy programs and tariff structures, and buys more American goods.That figure would be far more than China imports from the United States, raising concerns that Beijing could consider other forms of retaliation, such as making life more difficult for American companies in China or allowing its yuan currency to weaken further to support its exporters.Trump administration officials have been divided over how hard to press Beijing, but the White House appears to believe it is winning the trade war as Chinaâ€™s economy slows and its stock markets tumble.â€œTheyâ€™re not going to give that up easily. Naturally theyâ€™ll retaliate a little bit,â€? U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on CNBC on Wednesday at a Century Aluminum Co smelter in Kentucky that has benefited from Trumpâ€™s aluminum tariffs.â€œBut at the end of the day, we have many more bullets than they do. They know it. We have a much stronger economy than they have, they know that too,â€? Ross said.Economists reckon that every $100 billion of imports hit by tariffs would reduce global trade by around 0.5 percent.They have assumed a direct impact on Chinaâ€™s economic growth in 2018 of 0.1 to 0.3 percentage points, and somewhat less for the United States, but the impact will be bigger next year, along with collateral damage for other countries and companies tied into Chinaâ€™s global supply chains.

The move has led to a weakening of the currencies of the Philippines and other emerging economies.Dominguez said, 'I'm sure that our monetary authorities are making sure that the changes are not very abrupt.

"Vietnam Will Suffer Due to US-China Trade War Vietnam Will Suffer Due to US-China Trade War Vietnam Will Suffer Due to US-China Trade WarVietnam Will Suffer Due to US-China Trade WarHanoi, Jul 19 (Prensa Latina) Like a some nations, Vietnam''s key commodities, including apparel, leather and footwear are forecast to be hurt by the US-China trade war, which began on July 6 when the US imposed new tariffs on a majority of Chinese imports worth nearly 34 billion USD.US-China trade war's impacts on Vietnamese garment firms are now uncertain as most export orders for 2018 had already been signed before tensions escalated, Chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City Textile, Garment, Embroidery and Knitting Association Pham Xuan Hong was quoted as saying by the Vietnamese News Agency (VNA).If the tensions linger on, the Vietnamese economy is likely to be hurt as China and the US are the world's largest economies, as well as key trade partners for Vietnam.As the US imposes high taxes on China made goods, Chinese manufacturers are likely to move their operations to Vietnam to fill up the gap, and if there is a wave of Chinese investment in Vietnam, the US is likely to limit the import of goods with Chinese materials, thus putting Vietnam at disadvantage, the executive explained.For other exports, however, the war may bring both opportunities and challenges, he commented, explaining that Vietnam may be able to boost shipments to the US due to the limits on Chinese imports. Furthermore, the depreciated Chinese yuan will give Vietnam an edge when importing materials from China, Pham added.Chairman of the Vietnam Leather, Footwear, and Handbag Association Diep Thanh Kiet said the trade war has indirectly hurt the consumption market because US and Chinese consumers have switched to buying necessities instead of more luxury items such as leather, footwear, and handbags - leading to a slump in demand in the two countries.Nevertheless, from another perspective, if major foreign clients decide to move their production orders to Vietnam from China to prevent high taxes, Vietnam's leather, footwear, and handbag exports could grow by 9-10 percent from 2017, Kiet hoped.mh/gdc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Amid an escalating war of words with the US, China says it has â€œalready preparedâ€? to defend its national interests in the face of US attacks on bilateral trade ties.Chinese vice Premier Liu told US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a telephone call on Saturday that President Donald Trumpâ€™s order to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion worth of Chinese goods violates international trade rules, the official Xinhua News Agency said.â€œChina has already prepared, and has the strength, to defend its national interests,â€? Liu said, adding that China hopes â€œboth sides will remain rational and work together.â€?The call between the two top economic officials was the highest-level contact between Beijing and Washington since Trump unveiled the new pack of anti-China sanctions.China responded to Trumpâ€™s tariffs with declaring on Friday plans to raise tariffs on a $3 billion list of US goods. Beijing also warned Washington that it is not â€œafraid of a trade war.â€?Washington is concerned at what it claims to be the misappropriation of intellectual property following an eight-month investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 US.The Chinese official further told the US side that Washington has violated trade rules with that inquiry.In a highly controversial plan earlier this month, Trump announced hefty tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum of a lot of countries, many of them key US allies.He signed paperwork enacting tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum during a ceremony at the White House. The plan took effect on Friday.The move sent shivers through financial markets, caused legal disputes and raised fears that the confrontation could provoke a damaging trade war.World Trade Organization Director-General Roberto Azevedo also warned that new trade barriers would â€œjeopardize the global economy.â€?Trump, however, defended his decision while speaking to reporters on Friday, saying his efforts were beginning to bear fruit.The administration said it will temporarily exempt Europe as well as countries including Brazil, Argentina, South Korea and Australia from the steep new steel and aluminum tariffs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"China has prepared a list of retaliatory tariffs on United States exports to China worth billions of dollars in response to President Donald Trumpâ€™s proposed tariffs against Chinese goods.On Wednesday, the Chinese state-run Global Times, affiliated to the ruling Communist Partyâ€™s official Peopleâ€™s Daily, said in an editorial that the list would target a large number of major items imported from the US.The Chinese Ministry of Commerce has already announced that retaliatory tariffs will be slapped on imported fruits, beverages, meat, steel pipes, and more than 100 other goods made in the USA.Trump ordered his tariffs on Chinese imports last week.â€˜Making America pay a priceâ€™The Global Times said the US was naive to think it could make China agree to unreasonable demands as the Asian country's economy is strong and stable and has â€œweathered bluster before from previous US administrations.â€?The widely-read English-language paper said Trumpâ€™s new anti-China measures would inflict more hardship on the average American citizen by making commodity prices go up.â€œCompared to Chinaâ€™s list, the US list hurts itself more than China,â€? it said. â€œThis will deal a heavy blow to Washington that aggressively wields the stick of trade war and will make the US pay a price for its radical trade policy toward China.â€?While world countries have advised Trump against launching a trade war, the US president has bragged that such a war would be easy to win.Meanwhile, financial markets are on edge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"China says the United States is mistaken if it thinks it can elicit concessions from Beijing by taking aggressive trade measures against the Chinese state.Taking questions from reporters at a regular media briefing in the capital, Beijing, on Thursday, Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said, â€œRegarding the negative effects you mentioned we might be facing, weâ€™re already well-prepared [to deal with them]. We have the conditions, the means, and the ability to resolve the challenges brought by trade friction [with the US].â€?â€œWe hope the US will not underestimate Chinaâ€™s resolve,â€? he said. â€œIf the US want to use unilateral and trade protectionist policies to hurt the interests of Chinese and US companies without hesitation, attempt to restrain Chinaâ€™s development, and force China to make concessions, then it has taken a miscalculated step.â€?Gao also stressed that Beijing had made a â€œcareful assessmentâ€? of the US measures and had concluded that they would not have a â€œbig impactâ€? on Chinese industries.Official data show that Chinaâ€™s economy grew 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018, defying forecasts that the trade frictions with the US would have adverse impacts on its economy.Chinese officials have repeatedly warned against a trade war; however, they have also consistently said that China is ready to fight one if Washington proceeds with unilateral protectionist measures.US President Donald Trump announced last month that Washington would levy up to $60 billion in tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from a number of countries, including China.The businessman-turned-politicianâ€™s tough trade stand is largely seen as a cudgel to win what he considers better terms in potential negotiations to change the nature of trade relations with China and other countries.After the Trump administration disregarded Chinaâ€™s warnings against initiating a trade war, Beijing took reciprocal measures, introducing duties on American goods. On April 2, China levied additional import taxes on 128 US products, including frozen pork.Earlier this week, Washington banned American companies from selling parts to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE for seven years, while China announced hefty anti-dumping tariffs on imports of US sorghum and measures on synthetic rubber imports from the US.Chinese analysts say the escalation of tariffs is likely to cause more political trouble for Trump than for Beijing because of the differences in the two countriesâ€™ governance structures.Some analysts believe that Beijing and Washington will eventually reach a compromise and avoid a full-blown trade war; but so far, China and the US have held no formal trade talks to resolve the dispute.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Analysts on both side of the pond remain sceptical that the current war of words and tariffs between China and the USA will escalate into a full-blown trade war.To be sure, the risks are there for all to see, and indeed in Europe analysts at ING call a full-blown trade war the number one risk to the global economy. Nevertheless, we are still a long way from reaching that point.After all, although there has been a fair amount of sound and fury and some limited concrete measures, as it stands the tariffs imposed remain relatively low-level.â€œThe overall effect on the US economy should be limited,â€? analysts at Wells Fargo said on 5th April, in consideration of the latest round of tariffs announced by China.And indeed, most analysts think this low-level impact is part of the calculation on both sides. The US and China are at this point being careful to implement tariffs will not be overly damaging to bilateral and domestic trade.Yes, says Wells Fargo, there will be tougher times in the automotive, aerospace, agricultural and chemicals industries.Donald Trump, though, might very well say times would have been tough anyway, and his US$100bn response to China's latest salvo indicates he is in no mood for compromise.Instead, on on Thursday he took a typically bluff and no-nonsense line.'We are not in a trade war with China, he tweeted. â€œThat war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the US. Now we have a trade deficit of US$500bn a year, with intellectual property theft of another US$300bn. We cannot let this continue!'Whatever the views of economists about trade deficits, thereâ€™s no doubt that participants in all markets in the developed world will feel the truth and justice of Mr Trumpâ€™s remarks on intellectual property. But thereâ€™s an interesting dynamic at work here, too, beneath the tweets and the Chinese insouciance.Intellectual property theft has long been a hallmark of emerging nations, often, but not exclusively in Asia. China, by no means stands out in this regard. Historically though, as economies have advanced beyond a certain point â€“ South Korea, Taiwan â€“ intellectual property theft has declined as the benefits of linking in to global trading rules have become apparent. After all, for an economy thatâ€™s advancing at a rapid rate it can only be a matter of time before its own intellectual property becomes worth protecting.By laying the issue bare, Mr Trump is serving to point out that China is at something of a cross-roads. If it advances further onto the world stage condoning practices that it would not relish being the victim of, then actually the rise of its economic hegemony must necessarily fall.Or to put it another way, if China really does have aspirations of taking over America as the worldâ€™s number one economy, it will have to, at some point, make sure that people trust it.Weâ€™re not there yet, but it must surely occur to senior Chinese apparatchiks as they continue to build up economic and cultural power that in terms of trade trust is the greatest commodity of all.As to the trade deficit, thatâ€™s a matter for the US economy to handle on its own. Trumpâ€™s tariffs may well serve to hand him a big stick in future negotiations, as he may well be calculating, and some small concessions have already been won from South Korea in terms of export practices.But South Korea has its own reasons to stay on side with the US and may not necessarily be typical of countries that will be required to respond to the issue of tariffs.With the focus on China and the US, not many analysts picked up the cry of pain from Germany that met Chinaâ€™s response to the US tariffs. The Germans are heavily invested in the US, which they use as a manufacturing hub to export goods from to, amongst others, China.German carmakers might be forgiven for complaining that a major effect of the tariffs so far is the implementation of an export tax on the businesses of Southern Germany. And this is where things may start to get complicated for Donald Trump.US manufacturing jobs that are supported by foreign investors such as the German carmakers may end up by being more at risk than they were before the tariffs were imposed. From the point of view of economists, this remains a manageable risk for the world economy. But from the point of view of the blue collar workers employed by foreign manufacturers, it most certainly does not.The Germans are under no obligation to stay invested in the US, and if margins and profits start to hurt, a shift to facilities in other jurisdictions might start to make a lot of financial sense.The Germans wonâ€™t be the only ones impressed by this new dynamic. Other manufacturers and businesses too will start to open up new centres of business and to establish new connections in new markets. Once theyâ€™ve done so, theyâ€™re unlikely to come back, and the US could thus find itself increasingly by-passed when it comes to doing business internationally and globally.That outcome remains relatively unlikely, but the risk that it becomes reality draws closer with every moment that passes without any sign of a resolution to this trade spat. We are not yet close to midnight, but the clock is certainly ticking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The tough talk on sanctions continued last week as oil exports from Iran fell to their lowest in four months.The trade war between China and the US is heating up and producers are watching demand projections for the second half of the year.In early trading on Friday, Brent crude was priced around US$72 with WTI below US$67 a barrel.The first set of US sanctions kicked in this week and many key customers, particularly in Europe cut orders and found alternative suppliers.Shipments from Iran have dwindled in the last three months as the country gears for even tougher sanctions impacting the oil sector come November.The countryâ€™s oil production fell to 3.72 million barrels a day in July according to Platts.One of the key target areas that will make transactions difficult will be the lack of insurance providers for Iranian tankers, making shipping more difficult.Analysts say Iranian oil exports could drop by as much as a million barrels a day when the main sanctions are implemented in early November.Trump vs ChinaThe Trump government continues to aggravate China, with the country threatening a new round of retaliatory measures in response to the latest US action.The country says it will slap 25 percent on US liquified natural gas, making American gas imports uncompetitive for Chinese buyers, but it has resisted a tax on crude shipments for now.China has been importing about 10 percent of its LNG requirements from the US market. As US relations deteriorate with the Chinese government, the country remains defiant and maintains oil imports from Iran.Both countries will now levy 25 percent duty on about US$16 billion worth of imported goods from each other, with more expected as the trade war escalates.Thereâ€™s an additional US$200 billion worth of Chinese goods that could face tariffs come September.An all-out trade war could spell economic gloom and many analysts and investors are concerned about the knock on effect on oil demand.Goldman calmsThe global head of commodity research for , Jeff Currie says the situation is not as scary as the headlines may indicate.Speaking on CNBC, Currie say we must â€œlook at the fundamental picture, it really hasnâ€™t changed.Demand remains strong and Currie says that â€œlow stockpiles of crude means supply shortages could developâ€? adding that the investment appetite for â€œowning commodities, as well as oil, really remains in tact.â€?With global economic growth at around 4.3 percent and growing, Goldman Sachs holds its oil price target at US$70 for WTI this year.IEA sees rising demandThe International Energy Agency sees oil demand rise next year and adjusted its estimate in its monthly report.The IEA expects world oil demand growth to be 1.5 million barrels a day in 2019, up from its previous estimate of 1.4 million barrels a day.The agency expects prices to level off and said thereâ€™s still growth from non-OPEC players. The big fear on the horizon will be the uncertainty from the fallout of US sanctions where â€œmaintaining global supply might be very challenging and would come at the expense of maintaining an adequate of maintaining an adequate spare capacity cushion.â€?OPEC stays watchfulOPEC members continue to monitor supply to the market but figures on Saudi Arabian production for July were lower than expected.Oil output was down to 10.3 million barrels a day in July from 10.5 million barrels a day in June.Production from Iraq rose to its highest level in over a year last month to 4.46 million barrels a day, according to Platts.These numbers include production from the Kurdistan Regional Government. Exports are estimated at 3.543 million barrels a day according to data released from the oil ministry.With stronger demand estimates from the IEA, the price could remain rangebound in coming months. Geopolitical fears continue to threaten destabilise the market, but fundamentals remain strong in the near term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
China to not initiate trade war with US but to protect its national interests: ZhongChina says it will not initiate a trade war with the United States but protect its national interests in the face of growing US protectionism.Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan said at a briefing on the sidelines of China's annual parliamentary session any trade war with the United States will only bring disaster to the world economy.European Union and Japan urged the United States to grant them exemptions from metal import tariffs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indirectly, SA could be hurt by a US-China trade war, not least because it increases global uncertainty.When US President Donald Trump announced that he would ask Congress to impose a 25% tariff on more than 1,300 Chinese imports amounting to an export value of US$50 billion, the world held its breath for signs of a full-blown trade war between the worldâ€™s largest economies.Retaliation from China and a subsequent escalation from the US was swift, confirming that trade relations between the two are in stormy waters. Watching super powers edging towards a hostile relationship strikes fear into the rest of the world.What does this mean for us?According to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), South Africa exports $950 million worth of steel and $375 million worth of aluminium to the US, accounting for 1.4% and 1.6% of US imports. The US is also South Africaâ€™s smallest steel and aluminium market with Asia and Europe importing significantly more. But an ailing industry can ill afford any setbacks, and South Africa was quick to ask the US for an exemption from the tariffs.Despite diplomatic efforts in Washington and Pretoria, trade and industry minister Rob Davies is yet to hear from the Trump administration on where South African steel and aluminium exporters stand. Of course the tariffs could hurt our steel industry, especially since competitors like the EU, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil have been temporarily exempted from the tariff hike.South African aluminium exports equally could be hurt, which could be a devastating blow to companies supplying Tesla with components for its electric vehicle production value chain. Although still a small new industry, South Africa should be exploring it and stepping up as the production of electric vehicles increases.The real danger is that Chinese aluminium exports to the US, which are much higher than its steel exports, could end up being diverted to markets that could impact South Africa more directly.Global value chains have become the clarion call of development economists, encouraging developing countries to position themselves within value chains by specialising in specific components of larger production pipelines. It is estimated that around two-thirds of the worldâ€™s trade now occurs within value chains, making it very difficult to anticipate what impact a tariff hike on one element of the value chain could have on the end product.Many analysts predict that the tariff increases will hurt US companies and US consumers, from car manufacturing to basic beer can sales, even though the tariffs are meant to protect them from Chinese competition, fair or otherwise.SA agriculture would battle to up exportsChinaâ€™s retaliatory tariffs included a 15% increase on US wine, nut and fruit imports. South Africa is a strong competitor in these products and stands to gain on the Chinese market, if the country could increase exports rapidly. But South Africa already struggles to fill quotas on these products destined for the EU market.The ongoing Western Cape drought has also affected fruit and wine production. Many of South Africaâ€™s nut producers are very small and most exports are already destined for Asia. Investing in nut plantations to reap bigger harvests will take years.More broadly, analysis done by Citi shows that South Africaâ€™s total exposure to the US market is relatively small from a trade and stock market perspective, cushioning the country from any major economic fall-out that may occur in the US.Final death knell for the WTO?The WTO should have been President Trumpâ€™s first port of call to lay a complaint against the â€˜unfairâ€™ Chinese practices harming American producers. Interestingly, China has filed a complaint at the WTO, which opens the door for dialogue, negotiations and formal dispute settlement procedures. However, retaliation cases are rare and a WTO dispute case on this issue will likely take years to resolve. The failure of the Doha Development Round of negotiations has further discredited the WTO trading system as a win-win scenario for all countries. The rise of regional, bilateral and plurilateral trade agreements weaken it further.Ironically, the WTO owes its existence to the global trade war after the First World War that led to the Great Depression and ultimately the Second World War. Of course, the world was different then, but could this new trade war be the final death knell for the WTO?South Africa is a very active participant in the WTO â€“ our open economy benefits from an open global trading system. An effective WTO is essential for a common set of global rules, rather than the powerful calling the shots. South Africa and the rest of the continent have a vested interest in the continuation of a rules-based global trading system as it levels the playing field for all member states.Global instabilityTalk of a trade war increases global uncertainty and should be seen within the broader context of other rising global tensions, including the expulsion of Russian diplomats from the US and many EU countries, and Russiaâ€™s retaliation in kind. The questions around North Korea and the apparent warming of relations with China also come into play. Trump has signalled his intent to withdraw troops from Syria despite dire warnings from his own military that this could allow the so-called Islamic State to rise again.Trump has chosen to tread where many countries would not for fear of dismantling a convoluted trading system in which an attack on one partner results in damage for all. Chinese President Xi seemed to have calmed matters down, stating that China is committed to liberalisation. Confusingly, President Trump announced new interest in the Trans Pacific Partnership.Global insecurities may impact the gold price positively, but developing countries like South Africa generally benefit from a stable global environment. Disconcertingly, uncertainty is now the new normal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"News[ Submit a Story ] The following article was posted on August 29th, 2018, in the Santa Maria Sun - Volume 19, Issue 26As USDA tariff relief package details, local ag industry reports only minimal impacts of trade warBy Kasey BubnashNo clear end is in sight for the Trump administration's trade war with China, and while farmers and ranchers across the nation are reportedly feeling its impacts, Santa Barbara County's agricultural industry has largely made it through unscathedâ€“for now.'For better or worse, the specialty crops that we grow here on the Central Coast are different,' said Claire Wineman, president of Grower-Shipper Association of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties.Although some Grower-Shipper members in the area have reported potential delays of secondary support material deliveriesâ€“mostly those made of steelâ€“Wineman said they have yet to report any real sales impacts. Wineman said the Grower-Shipper Association will continue to monitor the situation, but it's been relatively quiet in the Santa Barbara County ag world since the trade war first took shape.The same cannot be said for other parts of the nation and state.Since the White House imposed its first round of tariffs on Chinese imports to the U.S. in January, a move that triggered a string of tit-for-tat retaliatory tariffs on goods between the two countries and others, farmers and business owners nationwide have expressed concerns over the tariffs' potential impacts.RETALIATION NATION Though the Trump administrationâ€™s tariffs arenâ€™t impacting the ag industry in Santa Barbara County, farmers throughout California and the U.S. are paying more or making less because of retaliatory tariffs. FILE PHOTO BY SPENCER COLEAlthough the Trump administration's tariffs, which are designed to boost U.S. production of goods, were launched in an effort to protect American businesses from Chinese undercutting and intellectual theft, the resulting trade war is weighing heavily on the agricultural industry.When the first series of tariffs were presented, corn, soybean, and other farmers in the Midwest reported pricing declines and voiced concerns over potential billions of dollars in losses.After several additional increased tariffs were recently imposed on American, Chinese, Canadian, Mexican, and European goods, including steel and aluminum, UC Davis released an extensive study in August estimating that the trade dispute could cost California fruit and nut farmers roughly $3.4 billion in losses annually. The loss in revenue, according to the study, would come from price declines caused by increased retaliatory tariffs on California goods frequently exported to China, including almonds, apples, and pistachios.Although strawberries are not one of the crops commonly shipped to Chinaâ€“most are exported to Canada and Mexico on refrigerated trucksâ€“California strawberry growers were recently granted market access to China just in time for the 2017 season, according to Carolyn O'Donnell, communications director for the California Strawberry Commission.The shipments to China were small, O'Donnell said, and had really just begun when the Trump administration proposed its first tariffs. The miniscule sales to China have since dropped off. In 2017, California shipped more than 2.1 million pounds of strawberries to China, according to data collected by the Strawberry Commission. This year, only about 917,00 pounds have been shipped to China so far.Although almonds and pistachios are the top crops exported from California to China and are most likely to take the biggest hits, the wine industry is also expected to face market challenges in the near future.China is the No. 5 export market for California wine, according to Linsey Gallagher, vice president of international marketing at the Wine Institute in San Francisco. At least 10 Santa Barbara County wineries are involved in the Wine Institute's export program, and severalâ€“including Storm Wines, Melville Winery, and Dierberg Star Lane Vineyardsâ€“ship to China. Gallagher said it's a high priority market for almost all active exporters.Despite the looming possibility of even higher tariffs on exports, California's wine exports to China from January to June increased in value by 14 percent compared to the same time last year, according to Gallagher.'With that being said, these additional tariffs put us at a further disadvantage to other wine producing countries who are also successfully growing their exports to China,' Gallagher wrote in an email to the Sun. 'The playing field is even more un-level now, with competitors like New Zealand, Chile, and soon to be Australia enjoying free trade agreements with China for wine, and therefore entering the market tariff-free.'Although the Trump administration announced last month that the U.S. Department of Agriculture would roll out a $12 billion relief package for farmers and ranchers impacted by the trade war, little of that funding would go toward struggling California farmers, according to Dave Kranz, communications and news division manager of the California Farm Bureau Federation.In the Department of Agriculture's revised aid plan, the details of which were released on Aug. 27, nearly $4.7 billion of direct aid would go toward seven commodities more commonly grown in the Midwest, including corn, soybeans, wheat, pork, and cotton. Only about $1.2 billion would go indirectly to more than two dozen common California commodities through a food purchase and distribution program. Another $1.7 billion would go to almonds and sweet cherries.But the Farm Bureau doesn't want short-term relief, Kranz said, it wants a long-term resolution to the trade war.One sign of such progress came on Aug. 27, when the U.S. announced a trade agreement with Mexico that includes a number of agricultural provisions, including continuation of the tariff-free trade between the two nations. The promise of continued free trade in agricultural products will ultimately benefit California farmers, Kranz said, and he said Farm Bureau members hope to see continued progress in resolving agricultural trade disputes.'We think that would be the best thing,' Kranz said. 'Farmers have put a lot of effort into opening some of these markets, and we want to have them reopened or available to us as soon as possible so they can blossom and grow.'Staff Writer Kasey Bubnash can be reached at kbubnash@santamariasun.com.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"What do denim jeans, Kentucky bourbon and Harley-Davidsons have in common?They could be weapons of mass destruction in Europeâ€™s retaliatory strike against US manufactured goods in the event of a global trade war.No, Mr President, it is not Star Wars but trade wars. Donald Trump opened up a can of worms last week with his threat to impose punitive tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium products. Global markets have been stunned into a state of shock.There is no econometric model for caprice and whimsy. Economics is supposed to be an objective science subject to random shocks called politics and the weather.Trumpâ€™s assurance last week that â€œtrade wars are good and easy to winâ€? seems more like an unscripted broadside from the The Apprentice rather than a responsible mission statement from a truly global leader.Trumpâ€™s politics have suddenly escalated into a major threat to global economic stability.It is no surprise policy advisers in the White House are tearing their hair out and wondering what comes next. The damage has been done, the perceived threat of a trade war is out in the open and it is no surprise financial markets are rattled.Being long and wrong, or short and caught is what [financial markets] are desperate to avoidWords are easy to say but they have their consequences and global confidence is starting to feel an icy blast of trouble ahead.Financial markets are rational and they hate uncertainty. Confidence about the future is crucial, irrespective of whether they are going full-steam into a rally or downturn.Being long and wrong, or short and caught is what they are desperate to avoid. Trumpâ€™s sabre-rattling comes just at the wrong time for global equity markets which are running thin on rally-extending stamina.Monetary super-stimulus saved the global economyâ€™s bacon over the last 10 years, but now the major central banks are on a mission to trim the fat and return to normality, financial market sentiment was already on amber alert about the risks for global recovery. Now the outside threat of an all-out trade war shunts markets onto full-blown red alert.There will be consequences all around. Trade wars put livelihoods at risk, jobs on the line and affect global well-being. If the crisis escalates, tit-for-tat trade sanctions will be less than a zero-sum game, a no-win situation for all concerned.China â€˜doesnâ€™t want a trade warâ€™ with US, as sides agree to more talks in Beijing soonGlobal recovery ends up slower, world trade growth will lose momentum and there will be little policymakers can do to stop it turning into a deeper rout.Monetary reserves are all but exhausted and the remits of supranational bodies like the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation have been emasculated by a highly critical and antagonistic Donald Trump. The days of international policy co-ordination and intervention are numbered.It would be a case of everyman for himself and a return to beggar-thy-neighbour trade sanctions and escalated currency wars.World economic recovery could slow to a crawl and world trade growth risks stopping dead in its tracksThe US would be OK as a relatively self-enclosed economy enjoying the economic afterburn from Trumpâ€™s recent tax cuts. Export-rich economies like Germany and China would feel ice-cold headwinds to economic activity. The demand for global commodities will slow, affecting growth in the emerging markets.World economic recovery could slow to a crawl and world trade growth risks stopping dead in its tracks. For financial markets pumped up on cheap money and overextended on hype, the consequences would be grim.Panic-selling could easily lead into a new financial crash. Markets have been close to a tipping point in recent months and Trumpâ€™s threat might have given the final nudge.How bad could it be? It could be very bad. The global rally has had a fantastic run for its money in the last nine years and needed very careful management in the monthâ€™s ahead coming to terms with a radically changing policy environment.Locked and loaded, China and US are marching into a trade warIt is not just the shock of the US withdrawing monetary stimulants but the threat of Europe and Japan reeling back the years of exceptional super-stimulus that has added to market concerns.The risks of a global equity correction have just escalated from a 10-20 per cent sell-off to a 30-40 per cent stock market collapse in the coming weeks. If the finger of blame points anywhere, it points to a US administration obsessed with â€˜America Firstâ€™ priorities.The fire and fury of a global trade war could tip markets into a meltdown of unimaginable disaster.David Brown is the chief executive of New View Economics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Commentary on the US-China trade war by an apparently fictional US professor went viral among Chinese internet users on Wednesday, with the blog attracting more than 100,000 page views.The WeChat blog â€œwas written by a seasoned US international strategist named Professor John Landersâ€?, according to its introduction. It contains several tactics the Chinese government can use to handle the challenge posed by US President Donald Trump.ZTE shares bounce back ahead of Trump meeting with Republican senatorsAccording to the blog, Landers â€œis son of a former member of the US Productivity Commission under Reaganâ€™s term, a scholar with a sense of justice. He recently made a non-public report on how the developed countries controlled the world, especially on President Trumpâ€™s statement on trade sanctions against China on June 15, and offered suggestions on how to deal with it from the perspective of a western scholarâ€?.Readers, however, could not find any information on the professor. But they did discover that the Productivity Commission is an official organisation in Australia, not the United States.ZTE should not become a drag for ChinaBlog by â€œUS Professor John Landersâ€?Further investigation led the readers to Zhang Meng, who teaches economics at the Harbin Institute of Technology in Shenzhen. His WeChat shows he â€œcreatedâ€? Landers.When contacted by the South China Morning Post, Zhang said the blog â€œdoes not have much to doâ€? with him. â€œThe readers should try to understand the argument, rather than spending time verifying who the professor is, or who drafted the WeChat blog,â€? he said.Bloggers with big followings can attract lucrative advertisement deals in China. A blogger with 100,000 followers can charge more than US$2,000 for an advertisement, while those with more than 1 million followers can charge US$20,000, according to marketing platform Captiv8.The real target of Trumpâ€™s trade war is â€˜Made in China 2025â€™The Landers blog analyses the statement made by Trump on June 15, in which the US imposes 25 per cent duties on US$50 billion worth of Chinese goods. â€œPresident Trump is the smartest western leader, who are best at negotiations â€¦â€? the blog said.â€œJudging from recent diplomatic policies, President Trump has accepted the fact that China has risen, and shifted the strategy to handle China from â€œcontainmentâ€? to â€œcompetitionâ€?. This poses a greater challenge to the latter,â€? it said.The blog urges China to never underestimate Trump, and that it should adapt to new ways of thinking, while making use of the its own resources. â€œZTE should not become a drag for China,â€? it said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Those who credit Donald Trumpâ€™s trade policy team with a modicum of strategic intelligence insist that the unfolding trade war is actually nothing to do with tariffs, steel and aluminium or even cars.They argue that the real aim is to use this highly visible tariff blunderbuss to soften China up for the real challenge â€“ which is to attack barriers to foreign companies competing in Chinaâ€™s internal market, and to slow its progress in developing technologies that directly threaten the Westâ€™s technology leaders. So the real target is Xi Jinpingâ€™s â€œMade in China 2025â€?.The base US case is made clearly by a research assistant at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, Lorand Laskai. Laskai starts with the US governmentâ€™s huge report justifying the section 301 initiatives against China, calling it â€œa searing indictment of Chinaâ€™s disregard for intellectual property, discrimination against foreign firms, and use of preferential industrial policies to unfairly bolster Chinese firms.â€?Is it time Beijing ditched â€˜Made in China 2025â€™ and stopped upsetting the rest of the world?He says the â€œMade in Chinaâ€? policy has â€œriled governments around the worldâ€?, and is â€œshaping up to be the central villain, the real existential threat to US technological leadershipâ€?.Laskai is definitely onto something here. China is without doubt tackling its structural economic weaknesses, trying to move up the production value-chain by bringing more high-value-adding work to the mainland, and trying to develop strength in seriously high technologies that have until today been the exclusive domain of American and European companies.For those who need reminding, â€œMade in China 2025â€? focuses on 10 strategically and technologically important sectors: next-generation information technology, including 5G networks and cybersecurity; high-end numerical control tools and robotics; aerospace; ocean engineering; advanced railway equipment; energy-saving and new-energy vehicles; power equipment; agricultural machinery; new materials; biomedicine and high-performance medical devices.To help achieve this the government has established five national manufacturing innovation centres and 48 provincial manufacturing innovation centres, with the aim of setting up around 40 national manufacturing innovation centres by 2025. Subsidies, loans and bonds worth around US$1.5 billion have been set aside to pursue the â€œMade in China 2025â€? objectives, with another US$1.6 billion coming from local governments.But it is at this point that I get cut adrift from Laskai, and the sanctimonious posturing of the US complaint against Chinaâ€™s new industrial policy. As the Washington Post pointed just a couple of weeks ago, these are â€œstandard tools for countries playing catch-up with the richer industrialised Westâ€?.I suspect the Washington Post did not recognise at the time just how standard such tools are. The UNCTAD World Investment Report 2018, released a couple of weeks ago, devoted a large chunk to studying industrial policies across 101 economies. It discovered that at least 84 of them (which account for 90 per cent of world GDP) have in the past five years adopted formal industrial development strategies.These of course include the US. And it is noteworthy that â€œMade in China 2025â€? is explicitly inspired by Germanyâ€™s â€œIndustry 4.0â€? economic rejuvenation strategy. The German think-tank, the Mercator Institute for China Studies observed that Chinaâ€™s plan was â€œa forceful and smart challenge to the leading economies of todayâ€?.China vows to end forced tech transfers in manufacturing sectorUNCTADâ€™s report looks in some detail at a large number of the industrial policies currently in place, ranging from India, South Africa, Bangladesh and Vietnam to Germany, Japan and of course China.It tracks how most economies are driven to industrial planning by four key forces: reducing unemployment and stimulating growth; responding to intensified competition from other economies; fears of â€œpremature de-industrialisationâ€?; and developing regulations that provide a good environment for global value chains.While the traditional aim of â€œpicking winnersâ€? is â€œold hatâ€?, governments are increasingly focusing on technological innovation, incentivising investor behaviour and ensuring investment in â€œessential infrastructureâ€?. That increasingly means digital infrastructure.The most commonly used tool of industry policies worldwide is incentives, with most economies providing generous tax holidays, preferential tax rates and tax allowances â€“ almost half of them devoted to the automobile industry.The US is, of course, in the thick of this, whatever the sanctimonious posturing against Chinaâ€™s 2025 plan. Key components of US activity include the National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing, and the Making in America initiative aimed at ensuring manufacturing accounts for at least 15 per cent of GDP. The US continues to use a wide range of subsidies to support its companies, and the Buy America Act conveniently protects many US companies from foreign competition.Chinaâ€™s sin, therefore, seems not that it has drafted a large and ambitious industrial plan, but that it is a plan that looks likely to be effective â€“ so much so that it might begin to challenge high-value-adding technologies that until now Americans have regarded as their safe domain.Unlike the US, I am not inclined to try to capture any moral high ground. I have real reservations about the net benefits of industrial policies, and am certain that a lot of the barriers in place inside China to block foreign companies from competing with local business champions do Chinaâ€™s economy more harm than good.To attack Chinaâ€™s performance requirements and technology-transfer demands is reasonable. But letâ€™s remember that most economies do it, so to single out China as if it were a solitary sinner is naÃ¯ve and hypocritical.I would be strongly supportive of international trading partners working together through multilateral channels like the World Trade Organisation or the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Grouping to pressure China to lower its many behind-the-border barriers. I am confident that China would itself be the main beneficiary of simplifying regulations, making the business operating environment more transparent, and making it possible for foreign companies to compete domestically.But to huff and puff as US officials are doing over China having the temerity to resort to the â€œstandard toolsâ€? of industry policy that are alive and well, at work in at least 84 economies worldwide, strikes me as the height of hypocrisy.David Dodwell researches and writes about global, regional and Hong Kong challenges from a Hong Kong point of view",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US President Donald Trumpâ€™s move to slap punitive tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, mostly imports from China, is an opening salvo in a trade clash between the worldâ€™s two largest economies that is likely to escalate, despite the personal rapport cultivated with President Xi Jinping.The decision represents a major step towards fulfilling Trump â€™s campaign promise to get tough on trade partners, particularly China, after winning the election on a hawkish platform. Under the Trade Act of 1974, the president may impose tariffs on imports deemed to hurt US industries. More actions loom on trade secrets, steel and aluminium, raising the prospects for a more confrontational relationship between the worldâ€™s key economic rivals and top political adversaries â€“ the leading free democracy and last major communist-ruled power â€“ which could herald the dawn of a dangerous new era for relations.This development may signify the failure of joint efforts by Trump and Xi to navigate the most important bilateral relations in global diplomacy today and could well prolong their temporary suspension of the main official US-China dialogue to bolster economic ties.The move followed publication of two China-related policy statements by the Trump administration. The national security strategy report identifies China as a â€œstrategic competitorâ€?, which seeks to erode US security and prosperity, and the 2017 Report to Congress on Chinaâ€™s WTO Compliance suggests widespread intellectual property theft and cyber espionage, forcing technology transfers and discriminatory practices limiting US companiesâ€™ access to the Chinese market.In real terms, the damage of the punitive tariff to the economies of the worldâ€™s two largest trading powers will be small. But the consequences of this decision could be hard to determine, as they depend on how China might retaliate and whether any tit-for-tat confrontation eventually results in a damaging trade war. China has its own leverage and is likely to use the ammunition in its policy arsenal.Beijing might file a lawsuit against the US through the World Trade Organisation, as the White Houseâ€™s decision was based on US law, not WTO rules. China could set up barriers to block the import of American products, delaying already agreed trade deals or imposing tariffs on some US exports to China. Beijing could also launch a patriotic campaign to boycott US products, as it has done with Japan and South Korea in recent years. And Beijing could threaten to sell US Treasuries, of which China is the single largest holder, potentially rattling the US financial system.Trump in Davos for World Economic ForumBut the stakes are too high should the clash escalate into a full-blown trade war, given that the two economies together account for nearly a quarter of world merchandise trade and a fifth of global services trade, as well as over a third of global output.As any trade war is mutually destructive by nature, any disruption will do damage to both sides. And it is not only a matter of whether they lose out, but whether the wider Asia-Pacific region, and the rest of the world, suffer as well because of the way globally integrated supply chains work.The real danger is that Trump seems to be ignoring the risk. To show his determination, Trump, in his address to the World Economic Forum last week, clearly pointed the finger at Beijing and declared that â€œthe United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practicesâ€?. And speaking to Reuters last week, Trump said he didnâ€™t want a trade war, â€œbut if it there is, there isâ€?.Cary Huang is a senior writer at the Post",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US President Donald Trumpâ€™s assault on trade with China is moving from tweeted threats and abortive talks to the real world.Purchasing manager index readings for June released on Saturday showed a gauge of export orders tumbling into contraction, the clearest sign yet that the oncoming trade war is having a real, negative impact on growth. From this Friday, the worldâ€™s two largest economies are set to begin charging higher tariffs on each otherâ€™s goods, marking a major escalation of the conflict.Thatâ€™s focusing minds among policymakers in Beijing, as China now faces the tricky task of balancing support for an economy that was already slowing with its ongoing desire to curb excess credit. As the increasingly important services sector remains robust, thereâ€™s little need to open the stimulus taps too widely for now, provided the nation remains on track to hit the growth target of 6.5 per cent expansion for 2018.â€œChinaâ€™s economy will slow down for the rest of the year, but we donâ€™t need to worry about any stall yet,â€? said Zhu Qibing, chief macroeconomy analyst at BOC International China in Beijing. â€œThe key is how international trade and the dispute between China and the US will evolve.â€?China fails to lure foreign funds as trade dispute hits stocks, yuanThe manufacturing PMI stood at 51.5 in June, versus 51.9 in May, and the forecast of 51.6 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The non-manufacturing PMI, covering services and construction, rose to 55, compared with 54.9 in May. Levels above 50 indicate improvement.The sub-index of new export orders fell to 49.8 from 51.2, signalling weakening demand from other countries. Gauges for new orders and the backlog of orders also dropped.That decline was also seen in South Koreaâ€™s June exports, which unexpectedly dropped. Part of the reason for that was one-off factors like fewer working days, but South Korea is a key supplier of computer chips and other components to China, which takes about a quarter of its exports. The Korean data comes out earlier than most other countries so it is seen as an early bellwether for the health of global trade.The China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing, which helps conduct the PMI survey explained in a statement how merely the threat of higher duties could be having an impact on orders in advance.â€œIn previous months, companies expedited exports because they had foreseen this complicated situation of international trade,â€? the federation said. â€œAs the trade friction between United States and China escalates, exports start to ebb.â€?The arrival of a bear market in the nationâ€™s leading stock exchange and the fastest slump in the currency since 2015â€™s devaluation have already made it clear that investors are on edge. Now comes the question of how the Peopleâ€™s Bank of China will follow through on last weekâ€™s signal that they will be more supportive of growth, and whether the current â€œstructuralâ€? approach â€“ where targeted policy tweaks aim at specific sectors, like small business â€“ will be enough.Itâ€™s only just over a week since the last supportive PBOC move, a cut of 0.5 percentage point in the amount of reserves that banks must keep. While that move unlocked about 700 billion yuan (US$106 billion), most of those funds were targeted at supporting a complex debt-to-equity swap programme thatâ€™s aimed at cleaning up balance sheets.â€˜The EU is possibly as bad as China on trade only smallerâ€™, Trump saysIn short, while economists forecast further cuts in the reserve ratio this year, it is not clear that they would be directly supportive of bank credit and therefore broader economic growth. Chinaâ€™s frothy property market and elevated corporate debt level means that simply juicing output via credit is not as easy as it once was.The central bank will cut the reserve ratio by another 50 basis points each quarter for the rest of 2018, according to a note from economists at Goldman Sachs Asia led by Zhennan Li. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg foresees the broader benchmark rate remaining at 4.35 percent through year end.â€œWe continue to expect the PBOC to adjust its policy stance as needed to cushion any domestic growth slowdown and any materialization of trade friction,â€? Goldman Sachsâ€™ economists wrote.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hong Kongâ€™s trade minister has vowed that the city will continue to be a free and open place to do business, though he said this did not mean it would serve the interests of the US, which is inching closer to an all-out trade dispute with China.As an independent member of the World Trade Organisation, Hong Kong would speak up to defend its interests, Edward Yau Tang-wah warned on Wednesday.The commerce chief was responding to comments by the top US envoy to Hong Kong, who on Tuesday said he was seeking to ease worries that the city would be a â€œvoiceless victimâ€? of the escalating trade friction between China and the United States.Instead, Consul General Kurt Tong said during a lunch at the Foreign Correspondentsâ€™ Club, â€œthe current situation presents a real opportunity for Hong Kong to demonstrate its lasting value as a transformative portal linking China and the rest of the world economyâ€?.Tong blamed China for adopting â€œmarket-distorting policies and practicesâ€? and stressed that the US valued free, fair and open trade.â€œHong Kong has an opportunity to proactively use its autonomy to further strengthen its impressive economic competitiveness, as well as its inherent value proposition in the eyes of foreign partners,â€? he said.Speaking on the sidelines of an official trip to Jakarta, Yau, the cityâ€™s secretary for commerce and economic development, said: â€œWe will continue to be a voice of the multilateral rule-based free trade system â€¦ and a valued partner of all participants in the system, including the US.â€?â€œThis does not mean that we will be serving US interests â€“ but the interests of everyone who does business with Hong Kong,â€? he continued. â€œWhen we speak up we are also protecting Hong Kongâ€™s business partners. So whether Hong Kong will be a victim might be determined by its circumstances, but Hong Kong will not be voiceless.â€?Yau and other officials had previously cautioned that collateral damage to the city was unavoidable, as China reciprocated the US announcement of tariffs on US$50 billion (HK$392.3 billion) in annual imports of goods from each side.US President Donald Trump launched this action to reduce the trade deficit between both countries and pressure China into investigating intellectual property violations, among other reasons. He has threatened to target an additional US$100 billion in Chinese imports.On Wednesday, Yau gave the assurance that the list of about 1,300 Chinese exports that could be subjected to a 25 per cent tariff was not targeted at the city.On April 19, he added, the government had made a formal request to join Chinaâ€™s dispute settlement consultation session with the US on the 23.6 per cent tariff proposed for aluminium products imported from five markets, including Hong Kong.Yau was part of Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngorâ€™s delegation for her first official visit to the Indonesian capital.The two-day trip was aimed at strengthening ties between both economies. Indonesia is the largest country in the 10-member Asean bloc, with more than 260 million people and economic growth of 5 per cent last year.â€œIndonesia is an important country along the belt and road,â€? Yau said, referring to Chinaâ€™s grand strategy to revive trade with more than 60 countries along the ancient Silk Road.Lam met Indonesian President Joko Widodo for an hour on Wednesday.At a lunch with 300 businessmen and officials, she promised to help Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, attract more tourists from the city.Hong Kong and Indonesia also signed an agreement to boost business ties. It was signed by Thomas Lembong, chairman of the countryâ€™s Investment Coordinating Board, and Vincent Lo Hong-sui, chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council.Lo was leading a six-day Hong Kong-Shanghai business mission to Jakarta and Manila in the Philippines to explore the infrastructure needs of the two Asean countries, which Hong Kong and mainland Chinese companies will be incentivised to fulfil under the belt and road scheme.Su Xinqi is reporting from Jakarta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Any trade war between the United States and China is worrisome, but if it escalated and tariffs are imposed, it will hit Washington particularly hard.Avoiding that possibility should be our primary goal.Our state is our nationâ€™s third largest exporter with more than half of the containers leaving the Puget Sound heading to China. The Port of Seattle estimated that China trade alone accounted for $18 billion last year and 40 percent of our stateâ€™s jobs are now tied to trade.President Trump has proposed tariffs as a bargaining chip to get better deal for American exporters and to punish the Chinese theft of intellectual property. He also wants to cut into our $50 billion trade deficit with China.The President frets that the â€œMade in China 2025,â€? the aggressive initiative designed to dominate strategic sectors, such as industrial robots, components for electric vehicles and semiconductors, will put our country at a significant commercial and military disadvantage.China retaliated with its own tariff plan consisting of a series of 25 and 15 percent charges.If a 25 percent tariff was levied on Boeing commercial aircraft, it could hurt Washington and impact the companyâ€™s orders, deliveries and production. After supplying over a thousand 737s to China, Boeing recently listed 273 unfilled orders of 737s destined for China airlines.So far, only the 737-800 and 737-900ER were among the $50 billion in Chinese tariffs announced in early April; however, if the trade disputes widens, more Boeing aircraft may be added, former Washington Governor and Ambassador to China Gary Locke worries.â€œChinaâ€™s retaliation is best understood as an economic and political demonstration,â€? the Wall Street Journal editorialized, â€œhitting a small number of products to signal where future blows could fall if the Trump Administration imposes punitive tariffs on $60 billion in Chinese good to punish the theft of intellectual property.â€?Tariffs on Americaâ€™s biggest exports to China, such as soybeans and Boeing jets, are currently held in reserve.But for Washington the immediate threat is the 15 percent tariff which may be placed on cherries, apples and wine.With the cherry crop ripening in early summer, the impact would be the most noticeable.Keith Hu with the Northwest Cherry Growers Association told KOMO News: â€œEverybody is getting pretty nervous about it.â€? China is the top export market and last year, it bought 33,000 tons of premium cherries worth $140 million.Besides cherries, China purchased $50 million of apples and $1.2 million in Washington wines in 2017.In addition to airplanes and farm products, our state exported over $1 billion in vehicles and parts, wood products, medical and surgical equipment and other goods.Other threatsChina has a couple of other leverage points we canâ€™t ignore. The Beijing government can pare back on its purchase of U.S. debt. It is our largest foreign debt holder pegged at $1.7 trillion.â€œChina has many ways it can make life exceedingly uncomfortable for a large number of American businesses, both those that hoping for access to Chinaâ€™s fast-expanding market and those that use China as an important part of their supply chains,â€? said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University professor of international trade, in the New York Times.Hopefully, President Trump is correct in his assurances that a trade war between the United States and China is not imminent and the stock markets here and abroad will settle down.Most importantly, a deal needs be worked out which will give us better protections for intellectual properties and a more even playing field for our products.The best approach would be to dial back the rhetoric and bring people to the bargaining table.Don Brunell is a business analyst, writer and columnist.

"This report was originally published by Michael Snyder at The Economic CollapseNothing is going to be the same after this. On Friday, the United States hit China with 34 billion dollars in tariffs, and China immediately responded with similar tariffs. If it stopped there, this trade war between the United States and China would not be catastrophic for the global economy. But it isnâ€™t going to stop there. Donald Trump is already talking about hitting China with an additional 500 billion dollars in tariffs, which would essentially cover pretty much everything that China exports to the U.S. in a typical year. The Chinese have accused Trump of starting â€œthe biggest trade war in economic historyâ€?, and they are pledging to fight for as long as it takes. As I discussed yesterday, the only way that one side is going to â€œwinâ€? this trade war is if the other side completely backs down, and that simply is not going to happen. So there is going to be economic pain, and that pain is likely to intensify for as long as this trade war persists. U.S. businesses that will be affected by foreign tariffs are already cutting back production and laying off workers, and CNN is reporting that 1,300 products have suddenly become more expensive for U.S. consumers. There will be nowhere that anyone can hide from this trade war, and it will ultimately affect every single man, woman and child in the entire country.Most Americans are not paying any attention to these ongoing developments, but the Chinese sure are.Earlier today, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce called the U.S. tariffs â€œtypical trade bullyingâ€?, and it warned that this trade war could trigger â€œglobal market turmoilâ€?â€¦â€œThis act is typical trade bullying,â€? the spokesperson said, before adding: â€œIt seriously jeopardizes the global industrial chain â€¦ Hinders the pace of global economic recovery, triggers global market turmoil and will affect more innocent multinational companies, general companies and consumers.â€?Chinaâ€™s primary English language newspaper was even more direct with their criticismâ€¦The government-run English language China Daily newspaper said: â€œThe Trump administration is behaving like a gang of hoodlums with its shakedown of other countries, particularly China.â€?Here in the United States, the start of a major trade war with China really doesnâ€™t seem like that big of a deal if you listen to the mainstream media. Most people just seem to think that things will continue to go well for our country no matter how many stupid decisions we make. It is almost as if a lot of Americans no longer understand that extremely reckless acts can have exceedingly severe consequences.One man that understands what is happening is the founder of the largest hedge fund on the entire planet. On Friday, Ray Dalio posted the following ominous message on Twitterâ€¦â€œToday is the first day of the war with China.â€?Today is the first day of the war with China. â€” Ray Dalio (@RayDalio) July 6, 2018Please note that he did not say â€œthe trade war with Chinaâ€?.The truth is that trade wars can often lead to shooting wars, and we need to hope that cooler heads will prevail.But for now, it looks like things will continue to escalateâ€¦But Trump has said his administration will respond to retaliation from Beijing with much bigger waves of tariffs, raising the prospect of worsening tit-for-tat reprisals. On Thursday, he suggested the possibility of tariffs on almost $500 billion more of Chinese goods. He described the potential escalation to reporters aboard Air Force One: â€œThirty-four, and then you have another 16 in two weeks and then, as you know, we have 200 billion in abeyance and then after the 200 billion we have 300 billion in abeyance. OK?â€? Trump said. â€œSo we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300.â€?If we hit China with 500 billion dollars in tariffs, there is no telling what the Chinese might do.As I discussed the other day, the Chinese could start dumping our debt or cut off our access to rare earth elements.Either move would be absolutely catastrophic for the United States.We donâ€™t know how this trade war will ultimately end, but as Reuters has pointed out, â€œitâ€™s going to get uglyâ€?â€¦The U.S.-China trade war will be fought in the trenches, and itâ€™s going to get ugly. The first round of tariffs hits on Friday, and U.S. President Donald Trump says they might come to cover more than $500 billion of goods. Exporters will feel the pain first, but uncertainty will also dampen investment, impede research and twist reform. It marks a moment of mourning for those who hoped the worldâ€™s two largest economies could work things out.And guess what?Russia just joined the trade war against the United States as well. The following comes from Zero Hedgeâ€¦Whether this is a coordinated response is unclear â€“ and certainly on a much smaller scale â€“ but Bloomberg reports that Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree this morning imposing higher tariffs on U.S. products in retaliation for U.S. duties on metals imports, according to Economy Ministry statement. Reuters reports that Russiaâ€™s additional duties will apply to imports of fiber optics, equipment for road construction, oil and gas industry, metal processing and mining, according to an economy ministry statement.These tariffs are going to have very real consequences for U.S. businesses and U.S. workers.Even though this trade war just started, some firms are already being hit very hard. Here is one example from USA Todayâ€¦Trans-Matic, of Holland, Michigan, shapes metal, mostly into auto parts, as well as components for door locks. It has paid higher steel costs for several months as U.S. steelmakers raised prices in anticipation of higher American tariffs on metal imports, company Chief Financial Officer Steve Patterson says. Trans-Matic has passed along the price hikes to its auto-supplier customers, but some have scaled back orders, reducing Trans-Maticâ€™s revenue in that key sector by 5 to 10 percent, Patterson says. As a result, the company is giving its 300 U.S. employees about five hours a week in overtime instead of their usual 10.For other firms, layoffs have already become a reality. Just ask the largest nail maker in the United Statesâ€¦In Poplar Bluff, Missouri, Mid-Continent Nail, the nationâ€™s largest nail maker, laid off 60 workers last month. Sales plunged 70 percent after Trump placed a 25 percent tariff on steel from Mexico and Canada. When the company boosted its prices, customers defected. Now, Mid-Continent is strongly considering a second round of 200 layoffs, company spokeswoman Elizabeth Heaton says, and all 500 employees could be axed by Labor Day.The longer this trade war lasts, the worse things are going to get.Fighting a trade war just with China would have been bad enough. But instead, we have decided that we are going to take on pretty much the entire world simultaneously, and I donâ€™t know if I have the words to describe how painful that is going to be for all of us.Many Americans seem to believe that the U.S. economy is an unsinkable ship, and at this moment we are heading directly for an absolutely enormous iceberg.Let us hope that someone is able to pull a rabbit out of a hat, because right now things are looking quite bleak.***Michael Snyder is a nationally syndicated writer, media personality and political activist.

"The trade war is ratcheting up military tensions between the United States and China. So far, this war is being paid for by the American consumer in the form of higher costs and lost jobs, but it could eventually lead to a military conflict.Military tensions have risen in the beginning stages of the trade war when on Tuesday, China refused to allow U.S. warship entry to Hong Kong next month. The Trump administration levied unprecedented penalties last week on a Chinese military procurement agency and its director for allegedly purchasing Russian combat aircraft, claiming a violation of U.S. sanctions. Not to mention the tensions already heightened thanks to the tariffs and ongoing trade war threating to break the wallets of American citizens.â€œIt all adds up,â€? said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, who teaches U.S.-China relations at Hong Kong Baptist University. â€œIt plays into the hands of the conservatives like Xi Jinping in Chinaâ€™s leadership that Trumpâ€™s real intent is to contain Chinaâ€™s rise.â€?Tensions rose further when on Wednesday, president Donald Trump accused China of attempting to interfere in the U.S.â€™s midterm elections. Trump said he had evidence, but didnâ€™t provide any. He also said he and Xi might no longer be friends. The Chinese government responded quickly to Trumpâ€™s accusations. â€œWe do not and will not interfere in any countryâ€™s domestic affairs,â€? Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a session of the United Nations Security Council, through a translator. â€œWe refuse to accept any unwarranted accusations against China.â€?According to Bloomberg, the U.S. State Department said its sanctions on the Chinese militaryâ€™s Equipment Development Department werenâ€™t intended to undermine the military capabilities or combat readiness of any country, but rather to impose costs on Russia in response to alleged interference in the U.S. election process.â€œIn China, they are debating how they can respond and there are some who say, â€˜We have to strike back,â€™â€? said Collin Koh Swee Lean, a research fellow at Singaporeâ€™s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. The countryâ€™s military actions this week are a way of â€œshowing displeasure without crossing the line into something more serious.â€?China has already announced that they will cut tariffs on non-US goods imported into the country as a way to protect their citizen from skyrocketing costs of the unnecessary taxation by the US government. This move is to combat the economic damage done by retaliatory tariffs in response to Trumpâ€™s insistence on a trade war.Right now, it would appear that China has the upper hand while American citizens will be left footing the bill for this trade war.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Farmers in Iowa are caught in the crossfire of the trade war. China and Canada were once two of the best customers of the state, a large exporter of soybeans, corn, eggs and pork. But, with retaliatory tariffs from the Chinese on pork and soybeans, farmers are having a hard time financing next yearâ€™s harvest. And with no Canadian trade deal in sight, competition with Mexico could be tough. Marketplace host Kai Ryssdal spoke with Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig about the toughest challenges facing Iowan farmers. The following an edited transcript of their conversation.Kai Ryssdal: So we had you on five-ish or so months ago, just as this whole tariff thing was getting going. What's the lay of the land right now in Iowa? How are you feeling?Mike Naig: Things have continued to progress here. Unfortunately, we've not seen resolution to those things that we were concerned about five, six months ago. China and [the North American Free Trade Agreement] continue to be top-of-mind issues for our producers overall, really, looking at the challenge of profitability in agriculture for our farmers today.Ryssdal: So if I'm a banker in Iowa and some farmer comes in and says, 'Hey, I've got this really great idea to plant a bunch of soybeans.' And the banker looks at the headlines and says, 'Really?'Naig: Well, they're certainly looking at the broad landscape. But that market absolutely does factor into their ability to secure financing. When you've got the cost of production that exceeds the value of the crop right now, that creates challenges that's not sustainable for our producers.Ryssdal: Talk to me about NAFTA for a second. We just heard this past Friday from Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, that the White House is near a deal with Mexico. Forget Canada, but Mexico, on that NAFTA thing. Talk to me about that.Naig: Well, we're very encouraged by that progress with Mexico. For Iowa, Canada and Mexico are our No. 1 and No. 2 trading partners. So, encouraged that we've seen the progress with Mexico, but we really do need to get Canada to the table and to do this thing in a full package.Ryssdal: I'm sure you saw the ad in the Des Moines Register this past weekend from China Daily. Basically, the Chinese government flat out blaming President Trump for the current situation that the Iowa farmers and folks find themselves in. Your thoughts on that?Naig: The markets are definitely being impacted by the Chinese retaliatory tariffs. And I think a lot of folks that I visit with across the state are no fans of tariffs. But let's be really clear about something here, and that's that we had trade disruptions and trade barriers with China prior to this series of events. This is a market that we should be playing in in a bigger way and have been blocked because of a variety of things. So we think there's a huge upside here for us to be a great supplier to the Chinese in the long run. But we've got to get some of these things right with intellectual property and regulatory programs that work. So we need to see some action.Ryssdal: Action from whom, sir? On what specific issues?Naig: Well, we need to get the Chinese to the negotiating table. The administration needs to negotiate with some urgency. Again, get NAFTA done but also start playing offense again on trade. Countries that were involved in the TPP for instance, Japan and others, those are important markets for us as well.Ryssdal: Let's remember that's the Trans-Pacific Partnership that the White House pulled us out of.Naig: That's right. We need to re-engage whether with the TPP directly or with bilateral agreements with those countries. Again, important markets for us. So let's play offense on trade as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was exactly 4 p.m. last Thursday when Peter Altmaier plopped into his seat. The pilot of the government plane quickly taxied to the runway and the German economics minister was happy to get out of Le Bourget business airport in Paris as quickly as possible.Altmaier had spent two days in the French capital last week as part of efforts to prevent the United States from imposing punitive tariffs on steel and aluminum from the European Union. And just before taking off for home, he received official word that his efforts had been in vain.International Newsletter Sign up for our newsletter -- and get the very best of SPIEGEL in English sent to your email inbox twice weekly. I agree to receive information about products from SPIEGEL-Verlag and manager magazin Verlagsgesellschaft (e.g. magazines, books, subscription offers, online products and events) with no obligation by email. I understand that I may repeal my consent at any time. All newsletters from SPIEGEL ONLINENow, the new challenge was to remain calm and make it seem as though everything was under control to prevent further unsettling the markets. 'It has been clear since midday Tuesday what was coming,' Altmaier said during the flight, somewhere between France and Germany.Despite that clarity, Altmaier had flown to Paris for the annual conference of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). At the conference, he said international economic policy was 'in a critical state,' and he met with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross.He spent nearly an hour speaking to Ross, a trim elderly man who is said to be a close confidante to President Trump. 'We have established a friendly relationship over the past few months,' said Altmaier. The images from Paris were important, demonstrating as they did that the minister left no stone unturned in his efforts to change American minds, even if the signs from the U.S. clearly indicated that Trump was determined to flex his muscles when it came to trade with Europe.Merkel Denounces Move as 'Illegal'The conversation at OECD headquarters on Wednesday failed to deliver the breakthrough that had been desired. And only 24 hours later, it was Ross who announced Trump's decision to impose the punitive tariffs on the Europeans. Since June 1, European companies exporting steel to the U.S. have been forced to pay a 25 percent duty on the import price, and 10 percent for aluminum. Chancellor Angela Merkel has denounced the move as 'illegal.'Thehostile move by the Americans likely marks the start of a trade war that could cause lasting damage to both the American and European economies. This could be the beginning of a long-lasting feud consisting of punitive tariffs, tit-for-tat countermeasures and constantly evolving retaliatory strikes. The EU has threatened to slap levies on imports of whiskey and motorcycles from the U.S. in response. Trump, in turn, is reviewing whether he can impose higher tariffs on European car imports in the event of European retaliation.Many jobs are at stake, particularly in Germany, and leading politicians are alarmed. 'I warn against further escalation,' said Lower Saxony Governor Stephan Weil of the center-left Social Democratic (SPD). The state is a shareholder in Volkswagen and Weil is also a member of the company's supervisory board. He said the 'threatened punitive tariffs against the German car industry would lead to drastic countermeasures by the European Union. Both sides would suffer from this,' he added. Researchers like Guntram Wolff, who heads the respected Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, hold similar views. 'This second blow would be especially painful for Germany,' he said.But it's not just about trade balances and company profits. The speed with which the U.S. has been turning its back on the world order it has shaped since the end of World War II has been breathtaking. From global free trade, to common rules and a World Trade Organization (WTO) that mediates in cases of conflict, Trump is running roughshod over a system that seemed almost custom-built for the German economic model, which lives on exports.'That's Not The Way You Treat Allies'It has been clear for some time that the president is jettisoning anything that limits the U.S. from wielding its power as it likes. Almost a year ago, the U.S. said it would pull out of the Paris climate treaty, and just a few weeks ago, the Trump administration turned its back on the nuclear agreement with Iran. Now, Trump is trying to take the ax to European prosperity. Rising consumer prices could stifle the global economy. That's what has typically happened historically.It was just a few years ago that the Europeans and Americans were negotiating the TTIP free trade agreement, but now the two regions are threatening to become ruthless adversaries. As luck would have it, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was on stage in Brussels at an event entitled 'Re-Energizing Europe - Now!' when he received news of Trump's decision. As he spoke about the EU's successes, one of his staffers slipped him a note.REUTERS U.S. President Donald Trump moved last week to impose tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from Europe.Juncker looked at the slip of paper before tucking it away. 'As expected,' he said, looking at the audience. 'Where was I?' He only mentioned the impending trade war at the end of his speech: 'This is a bad day for world trade.' He added that the EU would have no choice but to respond. 'What they can do, we're able to do exactly the same,' he said. The countermeasures prepared by the EU would be announced within hours, he said defiantly.After all that Trump has lobbed at the Europeans from across the Atlantic, EU leaders are in a fighting mood. Juncker will see Trump at the G-7 meeting in Canada on Thursday and going by what the European Commission chief said on German television late last week, he's not going to be beating around the bush. 'You don't listen, and you think you can talk down to the Europeans and belittle them. That's not going to happen,' Juncker railed in the interview. 'That's not how you treat allies, and Americans and Europeans are allies.'In contrast to traditional foreign or security policy, the EU actually does have real power in the arena of global trade. Measured in terms of the volume of traffic in goods and services, the economy of the European Union is larger than that of the U.S. And if the EU had a united front among its member states, it would be a powerful player in trade policy.Germany Stands To Lose MostBut, once again, that's lacking. Although French President Emmanuel Macron is pushing for a tough line against Trump, the Germans are showing hesitation. That's not terribly surprising given that the U.S. is Germany's most important trading partner, with almost 10 percent of its exports going to America each year -- products ranging from cars and machinery to chemical products. No other EU country would stand to lose more in a trade war.The first likely victims of Trump's tariffs will be manufacturers of steel, steel pipes and aluminum sheets in particular -- companies like Paderborn-based car parts supplier and steel pipe specialist Benteler. 'We will have to raise prices to reflect the tariffs,' says CEO Ralf GÃ¶ttel. 'Half of our customers will pay the surcharge because they otherwise won't get the desired products with the usual quality. The other half will buy steel in the U.S.'Machine tools company Trumpf in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg could also be affected if its suppliers increase their prices and pass on the costs produced by the new tariffs. That would increase the price of the raw materials used in its machines, such as crude steel, and Trumpf would have to raise its own prices in response. Doing so, however, would dampen demand. And that's where things could get painful, especially given that the U.S. is the company's second most-important market after Germany.Executives at Siemens, the global engineering giant, are still relatively relaxed at company headquarters in Munich. Siemens operates its own plants in the U.S. for products with high steel or aluminum content like trains, gas turbines and ultrasound equipment. In theory, at least, its subsidiaries could buy raw materials or semi-finished products locally to circumvent the punitive tariffs. But that does not apply to special alloys that are not produced in the U.S. They would have to be imported from Germany and would be slapped with the additional tariffs.DPA A steel plant in Duisburg, Germany: Trump's tariffs are hitting an industry that already has more than enough problems.The worker wearing a union vest at Gate 1 of the ThyssenKrupp steelworks in Duisburg is anything but sanguine. Trump is a 'madman,' he says, 'a psychopath' who is endangering German jobs. It's not difficult to sympathize with the man given the myriad problems already facing the steel industry even before the punitive tariffs. The OECD estimates there is a global overcapacity in steel production of 740 million tons. Predatory competition and price wars are so brutal that even global companies like ThyssenKrupp are no longer able to survive on their own. Management and employees recently agreed after arduous negotiations to combine their European steel operations in a 50-50 joint venture with the Indian steel giant Tata.For German companies, the greatest fear is not the potential 1.3 million tons of U.S. steel orders they stand to lose each year through Trump's 25 percent levy on steel imports. That represents just under 4 percent of total German steel exports, a figure companies could withstand.More dangerous is the possibility that Europe could be flooded with even more cheap steel as a result of the U.S. tariffs. A large part of the world's steel surpluses today goes to the U.S. A research paper recently released by the German Steel Federation (Stahl) shows that large quantities of that steel will likely be diverted to Europe as a result of the protective tariffs.Imports of steel products into the EU have already risen significantly, by around 14 percent, since Trump's announcement of his intention to slap imports with punitive tariffs. The countries supplying the cheap steel that is now entering the EU market are the very ones that were not provided with provisional exemptions from the new U.S. tariffs earlier this year: Turkey, India and Russia.If Trump maintains his tariffs policy, imports into the EU could increase by several million tons per year. That would present a 'serious threat' to the European steel industry, the paper warns. Smaller steel producers like GeorgsmarienhÃ¼tte or Salzgitter in Germany would be threatened with heavy losses.Carmakers Have Most To FearThe German automotive industry would also be hard hit by a possible trade war with the U.S., where the most cars are sold in the world after China. German carmakers export around a half-million vehicles to the U.S. each year -- particularly the kinds of expensive sedans that have been a thorn in Trump's side for decades. If punitive tariffs are imposed, carmakers would likely have no choice but to react with higher prices and thus risk a decline in sales. VW subsidiary Porsche is especially at risk. Although the company sells almost a quarter of its vehicles in the country, it does not operate any factories of its own in the U.S.VW CEO Herbert Diess has called on German politicians to defuse tensions with Trump. He says the company is interested in good relations with both the U.S. and China.That, though, is easier said than done. After all, it was the German government that sought to find some form of compromise with the Americans against the will of France and others. The offer presented to the U.S. by the EU in mid-May came not least as a result of pressure from Germany. If Trump were to refrain from imposing punitive tariffs, the European leaders offered at the time, they would be prepared to talk about the purchase of American liquefied natural gas (in a European market dominated by Russian gas) and a reform of the WTO.Now that the tariffs have been levied, the discussion as to how tough Europe should be with Washington is entering a second round.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire wants to make things painful for the Americans. The retaliatory tariffs the EU intends to impose on Harley-Davidson motorcycles and jeans are deliberately aimed at symbols of the American Dream, just as Le Maire wanted.Altmaier doesn't think much of such provocations and says he instead wants to avoid the 'vicious cycle of punitive tariffs.' And Ross also left the door cracked open for talks in his statement. The commerce secretary said he's looking forward to continuing negotiations with the European Commission -- a glimmer of hope that Altmaier attributes to his efforts over the course of several weeks to re-establish a dialogue with the Americans. But he also hopes that the World Trade Organization will step in to help. EU countermeasures, after all, don't come into force automatically.The WTO, to be sure, has been notified of the planned counterattack. But WTO authorities in Geneva must first determine whether punitive duties on jeans and other imports are proportionate to the levies the Americans have imposed.That will take until July and it will also buy a little time. And who knows, perhaps the WTO will tone down the EU response? At least that's Altmaier's thinking. His aim is to negotiate an agreement with the Americans on industrial tariffs, a kind mini-free trade agreement. He has already convinced EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m of the merits of doing so, but the French aren't buying in.At times, Altmaier has difficulty determining who is more difficult to negotiate with these days -- the Americans or the French. His usual optimistic nature has been badly dented in recent days.Even as he was heading to Paris last Wednesday afternoon, Altmaier had switched on the gallows humor. To prepare his staff for the new situation, he even sang a song by German songwriter Hans Hartz during the approach to Paris: 'The white doves are tired,' Altmaier sang against the roar of the engines, 'but the hawks keep flying.'The hawks indeed appear to have won the first battle.By Dinah Deckstein, Frank Dohmen, Simon Hage, Peter MÃ¼ller and Gerald Traufetter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"COLFAX â€“ Cody Miller, 21, has been riding in combines since he was 4 months old.He knows every belt and sprocket of the 1981 Allis-Chalmers MH-2 combine that his dad recently purchased for $1,300. The odd new part added here, with an axle off one of the three â€œpartsâ€? combines there, and the Millers cobble together a serviceable wheat-harvesting machine.But they have no idea how a brewing trade war prompted by President Donald Trumpâ€™s tariffs on steel and aluminum from China, Mexico, Canada and European allies will affect their family farm.â€œIt scares the crap out of me that we wonâ€™t be able to do this,â€? Lance Miller said. â€œThe grain prices are holding us all hostage.â€?China has responded, and other countries have promised similar moves, with retaliatory tariffs that are mainly aimed at U.S. exports of agricultural and food products such as soybeans, cereal, seafood, meats, fruits, nuts and dairy, as well as intermediate goods and transport equipment, including vehicles.According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the state of Washington could be hit the hardest, affecting an estimated $6.2 billion worth of exports and impacting 945,700 jobs.â€œTariffs are beginning to take a toll on American businesses, workers, farmers, and consumers as overseas markets close to American-made products and prices increase here at home,â€? U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue said in a statement last week. â€œTariffs are simply taxes that raise prices for everyone.â€?Brett Blankenship, 60, farms about 10,000 acres of wheat with his brother near Washtucna, Washington. Blankenship said Trump erased years of work to build markets for Washington wheat when the president pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.â€œIn this trade war, no one wins,â€? said Blankenship, the former president of the National Association of Wheat Growers. â€œThis is going to affect wheat, apples, cherries and Boeing. Anybody who shops at Wal-Mart will also be affected. This is not good.â€?Exports in dangerBlankenship said the biggest importers of Washington wheat are the Philippines, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia.China is still an emerging market for Washingtonâ€™s soft white wheat. According to the Washington Grain Commission, the stateâ€™s white wheat exports have grown to roughly 150 million bushels a year. As of April, China had imported 12.5 million bushels for the 2017-18 marketing year â€“ which begins June 1 for wheat â€“ half of which came from Washington.â€œThese markets take years to develop, but they could be destroyed overnight,â€? Blankenship said. â€œIn order to develop markets in the Pacific Rim, they respond to reliability and trust. And the current administration is neither, so we are very concerned about the long-term effect.â€?But Lance Miller, and others, said they havenâ€™t yet felt the sting in Colfax and they were not yet ready to throw Trump under the combine for at least trying to improve U.S. standing in foreign markets.â€œTo be honest, I donâ€™t know,â€? Miller said. â€œI donâ€™t think everything (Trump) has done is working. Something will come to a head sooner or later.â€?The tariffs donâ€™t appear to have undermined support for Trump thus far based on results of a recent Washington Post-Schar School poll. In the 15 states that have the highest share of jobs at risk from a trade war with China, Trumpâ€™s approval rating was 57 percent in late June and early July â€“ higher than the support won in those states in the 2016 election, according to the Washington Post.In a Brookings Institution analysis by senior fellow Mark Muro, the 15 states with the most to lose from a trade war include Idaho and Washington, the Post reported.Eric Maier raises wheat on about 7,500 acres near Ritzville. The former president of the Washington Association of Wheat Growers said production problems in Russia and other countries have kept the price of wheat somewhat stable.Soft white wheat was selling at $5.28 a bushel Friday at the Ritzville Warehouse Co.â€œI think the tariff (dispute) will work itself out,â€? Maier said. â€œIt does give us all some jitters. But Iâ€™m optimistic in the long run that we can come to a resolution. The problem with a trade war is that agriculture is the first one hit.â€?But Maier said he supports most of Trumpâ€™s objectives.â€œWe have to level the playing field. I see this administration helping with a lot of the burden of environmental regulations and making things a little more common sense,â€? he said. â€œSo I see a lot of positives.â€?While Maier did not criticize Trump for sparking the tariff fight, he agreed with Blankenship on rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership.â€œIâ€™m not a trade expert, but thatâ€™s one Iâ€™m very sensitive about,â€? Maier said. â€œJapan is a huge and stable market for us. We certainly want to keep that trading partner happy to the point that they are still taking Washington wheat. I am hoping that we get back into that agreement.â€?While wheat is a huge issue for farmers in Eastern Washington, an expanded trade war could also have huge ramifications for ranchers, said Dick Coon, who ranches on his familyâ€™s 11,000 acres near Benge, Washington.â€œAll of agriculture is nervous,â€? said Coon, who sits on the executive committee of the National Cattlemenâ€™s Beef Association. â€œThe futures market has been zipping up and down â€¦ based on people being nervous of the Chinese tariff â€“ and they are worried about Canada, too.â€?Like Miller and Maier, Coon generally supports Trumpâ€™s efforts, even if they spark a wider trade war.â€œI feel like whatever it takes to get the attention of some of these other countries, even though it might impact our markets,â€? Coon said. â€œI think we have been taken advantage of for far too long.â€?Family legacyWhile the impacts of the trade war remain in doubt, Lance Miller, 47, will continue to put aside projects and put off vacations to work on the farm that he hopes someday to pass on to his son, Cody.The father-son duo work as heavy machinery mechanics for Whitman County. On days off, they work on the Allis-Chalmers to keep the family dream of continuing to farm their 500 acres alive.â€œIâ€™ve got friends who have hocked everything they have to keep going,â€? Miller said. â€œItâ€™s extremely stressful.â€?To make ends meet, Millerâ€™s wife, Annette, helps out with custom mowing jobs and provides all-you-can-eat meals to Codyâ€™s friends who give a few hours of free labor.â€œThese guys wouldnâ€™t be farming if we didnâ€™t have good neighbors and good friends,â€? Annette Miller said.Lance Miller said he couldnâ€™t hold on to the farm if he didnâ€™t own the land, or the $1,300 Allis-Chalmers combine.â€œIn the old days, farming was a lifestyle. Now, itâ€™s a business,â€? he said. â€œA lot of the agriculture economy is driven by what goes on in other countries. That makes it rough.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"WASHINGTON/LUXEMBOURG (BLOOMBERG, AFP) - Top US officials on Wednesday (March 7) defended President Donald Trump's decision to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports after the EU warned Tuesday it would respond with its own 25 per cent tariff to hit US$3.5 billion of American goods.US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the United States is not seeking a trade war and the tariff decision was â€œthought throughâ€?. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, meanwhile, said the tariff plan will not hurt his projections for US growth.â€œWeâ€™re not looking for a trade war,â€? Mr Ross told the CNBC cable network, speaking a day after President Donald Trumpâ€™s top economic adviser Gary Cohn resigned in protest over the controversial tariffs.Mr Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. president, said Tuesday he would resign after what had become a bitter and personal dispute within the White House over Trumpâ€™s tariff plan. His absence will amplify voices like Mr Ross and trade adviser Peter Navarro who back the presidentâ€™s impulses to buck convention and pick trade fights on a global stage.Separately on Wednesday Mr Mnuchin said the tariff plan will not hurt his projections for US growth.â€œWeâ€™re comfortable that weâ€™re going to manage through this so that it is not detrimental to our growth projections,â€? Mr Mnuchin said in a Fox Business interview with Maria Bartiromo Wednesday. â€œWeâ€™re comfortable with the economic impact,â€? he said of the tariffs.Mr Mnuchin reiterated the administrationâ€™s commitment to levy heavy tariffs on the metals, saying that the plan is â€œnothing newâ€? and has been part of Trumpâ€™s â€œfocused strategyâ€? since his presidential campaign.Trumpâ€™s call for tariffs on steel and aluminum imports has prompted an outcry not just from trading partners but also from within his administration and the Republican Party over concerns they will spark a global trade war. Republican lawmakers are pressuring Trump to at least curtail the tariffsâ€™ reach to certain forms of the metals or by targeting a limited number of countries.The threat of retaliation and escalating tit-for-tat penalties damaging growth around the world is already rising.The EU warned Tuesday it would respond with its own 25 percent tariff to hit US$3.5 billion of American goods. The EU's top official hit back on Wednesday at Mr Trump, saying 'trade wars are bad and easy to lose'.European Council President Donald Tusk also proposed that European Union leaders hold an emergency debate on the trade dispute at a summit in Brussels on March 22-23.The bloc is targeting iconic US brands produced in key Republican states on a range of consumer, agricultural and steel products that will be levied if Trump goes through on his tariff threat, according to a list drawn up by the European Commission.President Trump is â€œnot afraid to get into a trade war, although thatâ€™s not what we want,â€? Mr Mnuchin said. â€œWe are definitely going to end up with these tariffs and we are going to roll these out quickly.â€?Mr Mnuchin has said that Canada, the U.S.â€™s biggest supplier of steel, could gain relief from the tariffs along with Mexico if they can reach an agreement with Trump on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement.The tariffs wonâ€™t apply to the US neighbours if a new trade deal is concluded, he said. Renegotiating the deal is key to improving the trade imbalance with China, he said, which will lead to a better investment environment for American businesses.â€œWe have to stand up for American companies,â€? Mr Mnuchin said.Mr Ross also signalled the administration is open to exempting countries besides Mexico and Canada from the tariffs.â€œThe president indicated that if we can work something out with Canada and Mexico, they will be exempted. Itâ€™s not inconceivable that others could be exempted on a similar basis,â€? Ross said in an interview. â€œWhenever thereâ€™s a big change â€“ an unexpected change â€“ you have to expect some sort of a negative reaction. Letâ€™s see how things come out over the longer term.â€? â€“The European Commission, the 28-nation EU executive, warned on Wednesday it would hit flagship US products including peanut butter, orange juice and bourbon whiskey with counter measures if Mr Trump goes ahead with the metal tariffs.The EU is holding fire on its reprisals as Mr Trump has yet to sign into effect his plan to set tariffs for what he calls unfair competition for US industry.But Mr Tusk warned Mr Trump's plans could lead to 'a serious trade dispute' between Washington and the rest of the world involving the EU. He said EU leaders should aim 'to keep world trade alive and if necessary to protect Europeans against trade turbulences'.Mr Tusk added that such measures include proportionate responses in line with World Trade Organisation rules.'President Trump has recently said and I quote, 'trade wars are good and easy to win,'' Mr Tusk told a press conference in Luxembourg on Wednesday, flanked by Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel.'But the truth is quite the opposite: Trade wars are bad and easy to lose,' the former Polish premier said. 'For this reason I strongly believe that now is the time for politicians on both sides of the Atlantic to act responsibly.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON â€” President Donald Trumpâ€™s plan to slap taxes on steel and aluminum imports was branded Friday as â€œabsolutely unacceptableâ€? by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, the United Statesâ€™ biggest foreign source of both metals.Trump hasnâ€™t sparked a trade war â€” yet. But his provocative action has raised the risk of an all-out conflict that could pit the United States against its friends and the entire global financial system that it helped create after World War II. When Trump announced Thursday he was imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum on national security grounds, he set into motion the possibility that trading partners would fight back with tariffs of their own.The rebukes delivered on Friday suggested that some countries were prepared to retaliate if necessary.Trudeau stressed in his comments he was prepared to â€œdefend Canadian industryâ€? and that the tariffs would also hurt U.S. consumers and businesses because prices could rise.The 28 countries in the European Union could respond by taxing goods that are core to the American identity such as Bourbon whiskey, blue jeans and Harley Davidson motorcycles, said Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission.â€œI donâ€™t like using the word trade war, but I canâ€™t see how this isnâ€™t part of warlike behavior,â€? Juncker told German media.Roberto Azevedo, the director-general of the World Trade Organization, warned that a â€œtrade war is in no oneâ€™s interests.â€?China â€” the worldâ€™s largest steel producer and Trumpâ€™s primary target â€” stayed quiet about how it would respond.Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans urged caution. Doug Andres, an aide for House Speaker Paul Ryan, said that Ryan â€œis hoping the president will consider the unintended consequences of this idea.â€?But the U.S. president appears to be in battle mode.He views the tariffs as a way to pressure trading partners into submission and wipe away the long-standing trade deficit.â€œTrade wars are good, and easy to win,â€? he said on Twitter.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross downplayed the risk of rising prices from the steel and aluminum tariffs. He held up cans of Campbellâ€™s soup and Coca-Cola during a CNBC interview, noting that each would go up by less than a penny under the new taxes.Even if Trump is itching for a trade war, itâ€™s not clear if one will materialize.â€œItâ€™s too soon to tell for a whole host of reasons,â€? said Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer and adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute.Because there are no formal declarations, Lincicome said the â€œimaginary thresholdâ€? for this kind of showdown would involve countries imposing a broad set of tariffs that choked off trade, rather than taxes on the two basic categories of steel and aluminum being proposed by Trump.The battle would extend beyond the exchange of goods to include services and investments among nations.For the time being, so much depends on a set of unknowns, such that the only sure thing is that the risks of a breakdown in trade have increased.The White House has promised more details next week when the president signs the tariffs into law.But questions linger.Would Trump apply the tariffs to political and economic allies such as Canada, Japan and South Korea? Ross only suggested on CNBC that the tariffs would be broad.Would any products get excluded? Thereâ€™s big differences among the types of steel and aluminum. A metal such as aluminum is used for the foil to wrap Hersheyâ€™s Kisses chocolates as well as the frame for a Boeing 787 airliner.The answers to these questions could determine how other countries respond.Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at the consultant RSM, sees three possible stages in any trade war.There could be a â€œliteâ€? trade war in which partners challenge the tariffs in WTO courts and retaliate with their own targeted import taxes. The next step could involve a broader array of tariffs that seek to penalize large U.S. banks and leading technology firms such as Amazon and Facebook. And, then, â€œif that spins out of control,â€? there could be a breakdown in trade agreements, the creation of non-tariff barriers and limits to the flow of money among countries.Yet simply by pinning his tariffs on national security â€” despite indications that steel and aluminum imports arenâ€™t a risk for the U.S. military â€” Trump may have already started to unravel the rules that hold the global trading system together, said Philip Levy, a trade adviser in the George W. Bush administration and now an adjunct professor at Northwestern University.â€œIf a country need only mutter the words â€˜national securityâ€™ to throw up protectionist barriers, we may soon a proliferation of obstacles to trade â€” that would be a trade war,â€? Levy said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fundamental Forecast for CNH: NeutralChina will release the 2Q GDP and it is widely expected to slow down to 6.7% from 6.8%.China seeks to retaliate against US via non-tariff measures and collaboration with other partners.Chinaâ€™s securities regulators expressed confidence in equites, and may further calm markets.The Chinese Yuan continued to lose against the U.S. Dollar this week, largely driven by United Statesâ€™ announcement of imposing tariffs on additional $200 billion Chinese goods. Yet, it was less weak than in last week, compared to all G10 currencies. Chinese equities saw improvement as well; Shanghai Composite Index finally had a weekly advance after fell for seven consecutive weeks.Looking forward, Chinaâ€™s second-quarter Gross Domestic Product (2Q GDP), the development of US-China trade war and measures from Chinese regulators will be top drivers to the Yuan and equities.China will release the 2Q GDP print on Monday. The gauge will help to reveal the economyâ€™s overall condition, coupled with challenges from external trade war to internal leverage cut. A widely-predicted growth rate in the second quarter is 6.7%, falling from 6.8% in the first quarter, according to Bloomberg and multiple Chinese institutions. Besides this top measure, Chinaâ€™s Investments in Fixed Assets (excluding rural households) to be released at the same time, is worth to keep an eye on. This leading indicator could reveal the outlook of Chinaâ€™s growth momentum in the coming periods; the May read has dropped to a record low (in 19 years).Regarding the on-going US-China trade war, the US has made its move of additional tariffs this week; the focus next will be on China. A simple retaliation of tariffs on $200 American goods is not possible, as that has exceeded the total value of Chinese imports from the US: It was $130 billion in 2017, according to US Census Bureau. Thus, China is looking for other ways to hit back and this is what to closely watch next week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods took effect at midnight, Friday. China immediately announced its own tariffs in response. As a trade war between the U.S. and China heats up, Texas meat producers and other exporters are due to take a hit.KUT-Austinâ€™s Mose Buchele reports on how a good deal for consumers is a bad one for sellers of Texas beef and pork. He says Texas doesnâ€™t export much beef to China, because U.S. beef was banned there until last year. But China does eat a lot of pork from the U.S. With China levying tariffs on U.S. pork, less of the meat will be exported, and its domestic price will go down. Cheaper pork means a good deal for consumers, especially in comparison to beef. If we eat more pork, weâ€™re likely to buy less beef, and thatâ€™s bad for Texas cattle producers.Tom Benning, Washington bureau reporter for the Dallas Morning News told Texas Standard Host David Brown that itâ€™s worth remembering China has taken actions in the past that have hurt U.S. businesses, and earned enmity across the political spectrum.â€œIn recent years, China has flooded the global market with excess steel,â€? Benning says â€œand thatâ€™s where we get these steel and aluminum tariffs that have been in effect for a few months now. And weâ€™ve documented the impact on Texas and beyond. Secondâ€¦ Most everyone agrees with President Trump that China has long flouted conventions on trade practices, whether itâ€™s with intellectual property rights or other issues.â€?Despite Chinese provocation, many, including Gov. Greg Abbott, oppose the new tariffs on Chinese goods. And at least one Texas company, Sim-Tex, is suing the Trump administration over the tariffs.Benning says Texas is the number one exporting state in the U.S. Harris and Tarrant counties are among the five counties nationwide with the greatest exposure to fallout from the trade war.â€œThere are businesses in Texas that have been quite clear that the additional costs theyâ€™re going to face from these tariffs will mean theyâ€™re going to have to curtail investment, they will have to potentially lay off workers, and ultimately, theyâ€™ll have to pass on those prices to consumers in some form or fashion,â€? Benning says.But the effects will be felt beyond businesses who trade with China, Benning says.â€œReally, no corner of Texas is going to be untouched by this, if this trade conflict lingers,â€? he says.Written by Shelly Brisbin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Trade tensions between the United States and China further escalated today as the US issued a fresh round of tariffs that officially went into effect at 12.01pm, setting off what state-run newspaper China Daily referred to as 'the largest trade war in history.'US President Donald Trump confirmed that the tariffs would apply to USD34 billion in Chinese goods, and added that further rounds could result in duties on products worth up to USD500 billion (roughly equal to the total amount of imports from China to the US in 2017, according to Reuters).China is expected to impose retaliatory tariffs in response. The tariffs would increase prices on American products (including soybeans) by 25 percent.More updates on this developing story as we receive them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON â€” As the possibility of a trade war between the United States and Canada becomes increasingly plausible, Ohio is uniquely positioned to be a casualty.Canada accounts for nearly 40 percent of the stateâ€™s export market, with Ohio sending Canada nearly $19 billion worth of imports last year â€” everything from auto parts to furniture to soap. Mexico, Ohioâ€™s second-largest export market, only received $6.5 billion worth of goods last year.Now, in the aftermath of the Trump administrationâ€™s May 31 announcement that it would slap tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum from Canada, America's northern neighbor has decided to strike back hard. On the day the Trump administration announced its tariffs, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the tariffs 'absurd,' and the nation released its own list of retaliatory tariffs, not just on steel and aluminum, but to household products ranging from shaving cream to toilet paper to inflatable boats. The tariffs are set to go into effect July 1.For Ohio, the impact could be stunning. Consider this:Yogurt? Dannon, in Minster, makes it.Strawberry jam? Smuckers, pride of Orrville, manufactures it.Shaving cream? That hurts for Barbasol, made in Ashland.Parts of washers and dryers? Whirlpool, with locations in Ottawa, Greenville and Clyde.Cars? Honda, made in Marysville, or Chevrolet â€” Lordstown builds Chevy Cruzes.Despite the possible impact, many of the companies have been guarded in their reactions. Honda, for example, said it is 'assessing the potential impacts' of the tariffs on both sides.'While we anticipate that the tariffs will impact Hondaâ€™s operations and business partners, we are still in the process of accessing the specific impacts as well as possible strategies to mitigate any adverse effects on our customers, associates, suppliers and dealers,' the company wrote in a prepared statement.For decades, the prospect of a trade war with Canada has been an idea about as likely as the prospect of a unicorn invasion.But the high-wire debate over the renegotiation of NAFTA â€” as well as President Donald Trumpâ€™s oft-repeated concerns about the U.S. steel industry â€” has ignited an unlikely tension between the U.S. and a nation that has been a steadfast ally. The tension has gotten heated enough that Trump â€” during a May 25 call with Trudeau â€” reportedly quipped that the tariffs were a national security issue because Canada burned down the White House during the War of 1812. (It was actually British troops.)When he first announced the tariffs in March, Trump exempted U.S. allies including Canada, Mexico and the European Union. He lifted those exemptions May 31 â€” an action that has provoked a cascade of retaliatory actions from all three. While Canada is by far the leading trading partner, the other two do significant trade with Ohio as well.To Ohioâ€™s two senators, the tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel are nonsensical. They donâ€™t mind tariffs, but want them pointed at countries that have dumped under-priced steel onto the U.S. market.'I think Canada should be exempted from the steel tariffs,' said Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who supports renegotiating NAFTA. 'The real problem is China. Itâ€™s not Canada.'Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, supports tariffs on China and others dumping under-priced steel onto the U.S. market but said complaints 'were never directed at Canada.' Tariffs, he said, were aimed at making China stop dumping cheap products onto the U.S. markets and at leveling the playing field. Directing the tariffs at Canada, he said, 'does not do that.'Consumers would see the impact in higher prices â€” the price of auto parts, for example, would have to increase to accommodate the tariffs â€” and businesses would see the impact in pressure on their bottom line. Some businesses, hoping to avoid sticker shock for their consumers, have already begun increasing prices in expectations of the tariffs, according to Ned Hill, a professor at Ohio State University who teaches economic development policy.Unions, meanwhile, appreciate efforts to make sure the U.S. is exporting as much as it imports. But while they are grateful for 'the concept of trying to balance the playing field,' said Tim Burga, president of the Ohio AFL-CIO, 'the way in which the president has gone about this ... is seemingly not terribly well thought out.'Both Burga and Eric Burkland, president of the Ohio Manufacturers Association are betting on â€” or hoping for â€” Trumpâ€™s volatility to work in their favor. July is a few weeks away, they say, and they are hopeful that Trump is using the tariffs as a bargaining chip and will pull back before Canada imposes the tariffs.'We donâ€™t want to end up in a trade war with one of our closest allies,' said Burkland.But Rob Scott, director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said the U.S. leveled the tariffs after Canada decided not to stand with America and punish China for its cheating. By imposing tariffs on U.S.-made goods such as playing cards and plywood, he said, Canadians 'are shooting themselves in the foot.' Theyâ€™ll be the ones paying higher prices for the U.S. products that theyâ€™re imposing tariffs on, Scott said.'They had the choice to work with us to develop tougher policies for unfair trade by China or the choice to pick a fight with us,' he said. 'They chose the latter.'Former Rep. Pat Tiberi, who now heads the Ohio Business Roundtable, said while Americans might not see the initial effects of Canadian tariffs on U.S. goods, they will eventually: A trade war would mean that at some point the U.S. would expand its tariffs on Canada beyond just aluminum and steel. The costs of those tariffs would be passed onto the consumer, he said.More immediately, the impact will be felt by Ohio businesses. While many of the companies affected are household names, small businesses will also see an impact, he said.The former congressman from Genoa Township said while many argue that the tariffs are being used as a negotiating tool, 'the problem is it creates a ton of uncertainty and uncertainty slows down the economy.'He added, 'Itâ€™s a very, very dangerous game.'Ian Sheldon, a professor and Andersons Chair of Agricultural Marketing, Trade and Policy at Ohio State University, said the policy may indicate the end of the U.S. taking the lead in the global trade system.'This is just blowing up trade system in my view,' he said. 'The U.S. trade deficit is definitely not solved by this.'Dispatch Washington bureau chief Jack Torry contributed to this story.jwehrman@dispatch.com@jessicawehrman",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The 'next area of challenge' would be China's high tech ambitions under its 2025 plan, which aimed to make China a world leader with enormous market share 'in most all of the new technologies that you can name and spell', Ross said.'That is a direct threat. And it is a direct threat that is being implemented by technology transfers, by disrespect for intellectual property rights, by commercial espionage, by all kinds of very bad things. So it isnâ€™t just the overcapacity in the historic industries.â€?He said US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was working very hard on investigating on intellectual property, but his report was not expected for some time.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, alongside business leaders and World Trade Organization chief Roberto Azevedo, Ross played down the idea that the United States was starting a trade war or hoping to kill off the WTO.â€œNobody is trying to ignite a gigantic thing like Smoot- Hawley did during the Depression,' he said, referring to a 1930 act of Congress that raised hundreds of tariffs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Behind the verbal spats between Donald Trump and China there are signs that China is opening its markets and a trade war can be avoided, writes Brian Caplen.Donald Trump is a divisive character to put it mildly but he is not completely wrong about the inequities of US trade relations. European cars exported to the US, for example, attract a 2.5% duty whereas US cars arriving in the EU get hit with a 10% tariff and in China its 25%.China, with which the US has a $375bn trade deficit, is hardly a model market economy. There are huge subsidies, excess production is dumped, capital flows are restricted and the renminbi does not float freely.The liberal consensus view is that trade wars are bad for everybody (correct) and that Mr Trump is going about everything in the wrong way.But whether because of Mr Trump or in spite of him, China has been opening up its market and continues to do so. Former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers notes in a Financial Times article that Chinaâ€™s current account surplus has reduced, it has improved intellectual property protections and has spent $1000bn propping up the renminbi rather than gaining the export advantage of a weak currency.Chinaâ€™s premier, Li Keqiang, recently addressed the accusations of intellectual property theft and said that rights would be strengthened still further and that foreign investors would not be forced to transfer technology. Of course, this must be followed through with actions but at least the intention is being articulated.Chinaâ€™s consul general in New York, Zhang Qiyue, said in a speech reported by the South China Morning Post that barriers will be removed or eased for foreign investors in the country's financial sector and that market entry standards will be the same for Chinese and foreign banks.'Many more measures will be introduced this year [2018] and some of the measures will be beyond the expectations of foreign companies and investors,' she said.In summing up a number of already announced measures, she added: 'China will phase in the opening up of bank card clearing and other markets, lift restrictions on the scope of operations of foreign-invested insurance companies and ease or lift restrictions on the share of foreign-owned equity in companies in sectors including banking, securities, fund management, futures and financial asset management.'This is not merely talk, as indicated by the December 2017 opening of HSBC Qianhai Securites, the first joint-venture securities company in mainland China to be majority owned by a foreign bank.There is a long way to go but gradually trade relations between China and the US are changing for the better. Provided China keeps on moving and the US administration recognises its efforts, a trade war can be avoided.Brian Caplen is the editor of The Banker.

"The escalating confrontation between Washington and Beijing inched closer to all-out trade war on Wednesday after China threatened retaliation against key US exports, sending global stocks lower initially.Beijing unveiled plans for painful import duties targeting politically-sensitive US exports, including soybeans, aircraft and autos, to retaliate against looming US tariffs on more than 1,000 Chinese goods worth about $50 billion.Wall Street opened sharply lower but closed with solid gains after investors decided their fears might be overblown.President Donald Trump's newly-installed economic advisor Larry Kudlow said the stock market anxiety was understandable but 'at the end of the rainbow, there's a pot of gold.'Kudlow is well known to financial markets after many years as an analyst on CNBC.US President Donald Trump meanwhile unleashed a tweet storm, emphatically stating the United States was 'not in a trade war with China' and implying he was simply fixing the mistakes of previous administrations.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross dismissed fears the trade confrontation could endanger the world's largest economies.Ross, in an interview with CNBC, downplayed Beijing's retaliation, saying the $50 billion in US exports targeted for sanctions only amounted to about 0.3 percent of US GDP.'So it's hardly a life-threatening activity,' he said.But some US markets already have responded to the trade spat with higher prices and tighter supplies even though the largest of the retaliatory duties have yet to take effect.Steel and aluminum suppliers began raising prices within 24 hours of Trump announcement last month of his intention to hit the metals with steep import tariffs, according to the Institute for Supply Management.Industry groups renewed calls for the White House to change tack.The powerful US Chamber of Commerce, a stalwart supporter of Republican lawmakers, said tariffs were 'not the way' to achieve fairer trade with China.And aviation giant Boeing, which could see some of its smaller planes impacted by China's tariffs as well as facing higher metals costs, said both sides could 'do harm to the global aerospace industry.'The company said it 'will continue to engage both governments' as the sides note that 'productive talks are ongoing.'- Will Trump blink first? -China is the largest market for US soy and the threat of tariffs on exports of the commodity has the potential to whip up trade anxieties in stalwart Republican areas.The American Soybean Association called on the Trump administration 'to reconsider the tariffs that led to this retaliation.'Scott Miller, a trade policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told AFP the tariffs proposed so far were unlikely to dent overall economic growth.But that 'does not mean there isn't going to be a political backlash,' he said.'I think China is perfectly happy to play a game of chicken with the United States on this because they believe the US will blink first.'But a US trade official told reporters the China's retaliation is 'simply an effort to intimidate us or to get us to back down so that they can continue doing all the bad things' including taking intellectual property from American companies.Other than steel and aluminum, the tariffs are only threat at this point: the US will have a 30-day comment period before determining the final list of Chinese goods on the hit list, and China also is holding off pending talks.Should the tariffs go into effect, however, they would make for one of the largest trade wars ever involving the United States, said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.The amount $50 billion 'in each direction is far larger than previous trade spats that we've had,' he told AFP.But Hufbauer said as November's mid-term elections approach, the political ramifications of the current trade policy could be greater than the economic ones for Trump.'He's hurting his base, he's really annoyed a lot of Republicans in the senate and the house,' said Hufbauer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THE US-China trade war has taken centre stage on the global markets and there is no other issue that looms as large in international trade. Should the average investor then contemplate what it really means and how it could affect him or her?Where are we today? How did things get so far? And just how serious is the situation?Earlier this month, the trade dispute between the two superpowers entered a new phase with the US slapping higher tariffs on US$34 billion (RM138 billion) worth of Chinese imports. That was apart from another threat by US President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on US$450 billion worth of Chinese goods should Beijing attempt a tit-for-tat retaliation.The Chinese government has hit back with its own penalties, targeting a range of American products with tariffs, including pork, soybeans and automobiles.David Dollar, a Senior Fellow at the John L Thornton China Center at Brookings Institution, points out that while the trade taxes that have been introduced so far are minor, they mark the most trade protection the US has put in place since the 1930s.Note that apart from Chinese products, the US had earlier imposed tariffs on imported steel, aluminium, solar panels and washing machines from countries such as Canada, Mexico, the EU and Japan.Dollar observes that the tariffs put in place by the US so far amount to less than 5% of imports, but the key question now is whether Trump will follow through on his threat to tax auto imports and all imports from China.â€œThose measures would take affected imports up to about US$1 trillion, or roughly half of US imports. So far, all of the targeted countries have retaliated. If that continues, then soon, there could be import tariffs on US$1 trillion in each direction. That would be a big deal,â€? Dollar tells The Edge.He warns that in the event of a full-scale trade war, investments in many different countries are likely to slow. Companies will be uncertain about future rules as it will be difficult to predict whether the protection will be permanent or temporary.â€œThe smart move would be to delay investments, and if enough firms do that, then the economy will go into a recession,â€? says Dollar, who was the US Treasuryâ€™s economic emissary to China when Barack Obama was US president.Dr Wong Chin Yoong, associate professor in international macroeconomics at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR), agrees that the impact of the trade war is minimal at the moment.â€œEven though US$34 billion sounds like a big number, if you compare that with the gross domestic product of the US and China, it is not even 1%,â€? he tells The Edge.A quick check of World Bank data shows that the US$34 billion of Chinese goods affected by the tariffs implemented on July 6 amounts to a mere 0.17% and 0.28% of the US and Chinaâ€™s GDP respectively.â€œOf course, what we are seeing now is just the first-round punch. If the trade tension escalates with the US ultimately imposing tariffs on more than half-a-trillion dollarsâ€™ worth of Chinese goods and it eventually becomes a multilateral trade war, that would be Armageddon,â€? Wong says.How vulnerable are we?Chen Gong of Anbound Consulting, an independent think-tank based in Beijing, opines that we are still very much in the early stages of a global trade war and it is too early to speculate on the worst-case scenario.â€œWhen we talk about how serious the trade war could be, to me, it is never about who is the winner and loser, but more about the recovery and restructuring of globalisation. Thatâ€™s because the trade war could damage the whole global trade order. All countries will be affected, including the US and China,â€? says Chen, who is chief researcher of Anbound Consulting.If there is an all-out trade war, the whole world will be in chaos, while the economic growth of emerging markets, including Malaysia, will be badly hit.â€œMy guess is that the damage could be even worse than what happened during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. All I want to say is that it is easier to destroy the world than to build it,â€? he declares.Dr Ngeow Chow Bing of the University of Malaya is of the view that Malaysia is very vulnerable to the spillover effects. â€œBut of course, if we ever reach this stage, we will not be only country that will be affected. South Korea, Japan and all the Asean countries will be affected. We are in a passive position. We know we are in danger and at risk, but there is only so much we can do,â€? says Ngeow, who is acting director of the universityâ€™s Institute of China Studies.While some people might have a positive view that Malaysia could still benefit from the trade war as Chinese companies could relocate their plants here to avoid the higher tariffs imposed by the US, Ngeow says that is not a realistic expectation.â€œThatâ€™s because we simply do not have sufficient capacity to absorb the relocation. I would say the impact of the trade war to Malaysia is negative... itâ€™s as simple as that, no positive outcome whatsoever.â€?On a scale of 0 to 10, UTARâ€™s Wong says Malaysiaâ€™s vulnerability level is probably at 5 now.â€œMany multinational corporations that have a base in China would also have a base in Korea and Taiwan, as well as other Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia. Internally, they would have to make adjustments for shocks. If the orders from China to the US come down because of the tariff war, the orders may come to our country. That is the plus thing that could offset the minus thing,â€? he explains.Trade war vs Cold WarIt is interesting that some scholars have pointed to similarities between the Cold War â€” the rivalry between the US and the USSR after World War II â€” and the trade war. If the Soviet Union was perceived as the USâ€™ biggest enemy during the Cold War, today, China is seen as its biggest threat.Brookings Institutionâ€™s Dollar observes that there was very little economic exchange between the West and the Soviet bloc during the Cold War, but there is a high degree of integration between China and the West today. Thus, any attempt to isolate China will be very costly and is likely to fail.â€œProbably, most of Europe and Asia will not go along with a policy to isolate China, so the US would be isolating itself, not isolating China. Thus, there is a strong economic incentive for the US and China to find a way to get along. They will be competitors, but the key question is whether the two can agree to the rules of economic competition.â€?Dollar explains that the world has become increasingly integrated in terms of trade and investment. This means that a trade war, even if it mainly involves the US and China, will cause collateral damage in third countries.â€œMuch of Chinaâ€™s exports are part of global value chains that involve many countries, including Malaysia. When the US takes aim at products exported by China, it hurts a lot of other countries as well.â€?UMâ€™s Ngeow says the impact of the trade war will be more significant than the Cold War for the simple reason that there were no such things as global supply chains and integration at that time.â€œThe main difference is that the Soviet Union did not participate in the global trade networks but on the Eastern Bloc. Thatâ€™s why the US could afford to go into the Cold War with the Soviet Union. But today, China is part of global trade networks. If the Chinese economy collapses, the whole world will be affected, and I donâ€™t think the US wants to see that either,â€? he stresses.Looking at the 2017/18 North Korea crisis, few would have predicted that North Koreaâ€™s supreme leader Kim Jong-Un would play the role of a â€œman of peaceâ€? by making a historic visit to South Korea in April. This was followed by a June meeting with Trump in Singapore to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.Is a easing of US-China trade tensions then on the horizon?Dollar of Brookings Institutionâ€™ does not rule out the possibility.â€œThe North Korea analogy is an interesting one. The Singapore summit led to a vague agreement, which is now being followed by difficult, slow negotiations. Probably, it will be a long time before North Korea sees any sanctions relief from the US.â€?Dollar, however, does not think there is much hope of resolving trade tensions this year. But next year, the US economy is expected to slow down and the cost of protectionism will become more apparent. There could easily be a push for a Trump-Xi summit to negotiate a truce.UTARâ€™s Wong says the US and EU have just agreed on a deal to not escalate tensions, but also to not end the tariff war. This could give the US more room to continue, or even escalate, the clash with China as the EU has promised to import more soybeans from the US.He believes while it is possible China and the US could strike a sudden compromise that could ease tensions quickly, the capricious Trump could also renege on any deal, given his track record.UMâ€™s Ngeow opines that China is not very keen on a full-blown trade war because it is more likely to suffer than the US.â€œIf you look at the trade numbers, Chinaâ€™s exports to the US are much bigger than US exports to China. The thing is, both countries think they can win the trade war. That, to me, is the most dangerous mentality,â€? he warns.However, he feels China will endure and then walk away from the trade war.â€œTrumpâ€™s gambler attitude may gain him another victory, but China will keep this in mind for years to come,â€? he predicts.Anboundâ€™s Chen is more pessimistic and cautions that we should be prepared for a prolonged trade war.â€œThe US-China trade war is not going to be over anytime soon, at least not during Trumpâ€™s era. The trade war is happening against the backdrop of globalisation. Unless all countries can remain rational in trade negotiations, the messy trade war will never come to an end.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THERE are bound to be winners and losers in the growing US-China trade war.But ascertaining who they are and which side of the equation they fall on will take a bit more time as the tariffs were implemented only recently, analysts say, noting that trade tensions could escalate further.MIDF research head Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman tells The Edge that it is still unclear to what extent companies will benefit or lose based on the developments so far.When asked if investors should have a trading strategy with the trade war in mind, Redza says they should weigh the impact of recently implemented tariffs, as well as those levied earlier on steel and aluminium.â€œAt the moment, the export numbers, particularly from the electrical and electronics (E&E) side, remain strong albeit with tapering growth. But certainly, the geopolitical risks, including the impact of the trade war, are a key influence on market sentiment and investors could trade on the price volatility of related stocks â€” buying on weakness and taking profit on strength.â€?He points out that the tariffs will be a slight negative for companies in industries that supply parts and components that are then assembled into finished products, including those in the E&E segment, and oil and gas players that export steel parts.But Redza says the USâ€™ tariffs on steel from China could be positive for the automotive sector as China could redirect its supply from the US to global markets, thus reducing costs for carmakers. â€œFor Malaysian distributors and assemblers, car components are purchased as part of CKD (completely knocked down) packs at a pre-negotiated price from principal OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) which are the ones directly exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices.â€?Plantations could also benefit from the trade war, owing to the tariffs imposed by China on US soybean oil imports, which are seen as a substitute for palm oil.Other segments that could be at an advantage include shipping and logistics because China is expected to seek alternatives in the Latin America-Asia shipping routes. Redza says this will bode well for local port operators Westports Holdings Bhd and MMC Corp Bhd as they are strategically located along the Europe-Asia and Latin America-Asia servicing routes.Inter-Pacific Research Sdn Bhd research head Pong Teng Siew says investors need to be cautious as the trade war is â€œstill a work in progressâ€?, but he does not see plantation players gaining.â€œWe havenâ€™t seen the next US$200 billion (RM811.7 billion) of tariffs as they are still finalising the list of goods to be included there. And [US President Donald] Trump has also started talking about imposing tariffs on a total of US$500 billion of goods.â€œThe actual impact will depend on individual companies and some will be more affected than others.â€?Pong does not believe the plantation sector will be a beneficiary of Chinaâ€™s soybean tariffs as the price of palm oil correlates with that of soybean oil, and the two commodities tend to move in tandem.â€œGenerally, if the USâ€™ soybean exports are affected and prices fall, it will translate into weaker prices for palm oil as well. They tend to fall together.â€œTo me, it is a negative. The trade war will have a negative impact on palm oil prices and export values,â€? he says.JF Apex Securities is wary of a further spike in trade tensions between the two giants as both continue to retaliate with more tariffs, which could disrupt global supply chains for technological and industrial products.â€œMalaysia, being an open economy that is highly dependent on international trade, could see great repercussions from the trade conflict. We opine that the market has yet to fully discount the negative impact as the magnitude of the conflict is still hard to determine at this juncture due to the complexity of the global supply chain,â€? it wrote in a recent report.Earlier in the month, Trump announced 25% tariffs on about US$34 billion worth of Chinese imports, which will eventually be widened to cover up to US$50 billion of goods.China has retaliated in kind, placing tariffs on US$34 billion worth of goods from the US, including soybeans, pork and electric vehicles.However, as Trump has indicated plans to impose 10% tariffs on an additional US$200 billion of Chinese imports, the trade war may still have a long way to go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"KUALA LUMPUR (July 2): Malaysian shares started the week lower, along with its regional peers as concerns about the potential for a trade war between the US and China continue to drag down the FBM KLCI.At 5pm, the benchmark index fell by 6.45 points or 0.38% to close at 1,685.05 points, after hitting an intra-day high of 1,697.15 points. The index fell to an intraday low of 1,677.33 points.When contacted, Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd senior research analyst Kenneth Leong told theedgemarkets.com that despite the KLCI opening higher at opening bell today, it gave up all its intra-day gains by market close due to the concerns.'Concerns (on the trade war) would persist in the short term as there will be tariff from US on US$34 billion worth of China goods by July 6, and there might be more to come as indicated by US President Donald Trump,' he said.'Oil price also [saw] some pullback today. Generally, the market was quite bearish today, the silver lining would be the resilience among the consumer product sector as they are defensive in nature,' Leong added.Reuters reported that a renewed slide in Chinese shares and a sobering set of factory surveys dragged down Asian markets today, while the euro and the Mexican peso were both jolted by political developments at home.Regionally, Japan's Nikkei slipped by 2.21% today, together with South Korea's Kospi, which was down 2.35%, while Hong Kong Hang Seng Index rose 1.61%.Trading volume decreased to 1.7 billion shares worth RM1.62 billion compared with Friday's 2.23 billion shares worth RM2.98 billion.

"KUALA LUMPUR (July 18): Former International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamad asked the countryâ€™s new administration today, if it would play a lead role in fighting the scourge of the trade war involving the United States, European Union and China.â€œSeeing that trade tensions between China, the EU and US are getting worse and more serious, would Malaysia assume leadership in this matter via Asean or the World Trade Organisation, as their trade is important to us?â€œWould Malaysia act to ensure that the trade war does not spread further to the extent of impacting the global economy. It seems the other countries of the world are powerless, while the action taken by the (US, EU and China) is rampant,â€? he said at the Dewan Rakyat.Responding to the supplementary question on the trade war's impact on our local industry, Mustapaâ€™s successor Darrel Leiking said Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad would give clarity in a meeting to be held in Singapore soon, to look for a good solution.Earlier, Leiking said although the US is Malaysiaâ€™s largest importer of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells (CSPV), solar products that use the thin film technology are exempted from US protectionist measures.Export value of CSPV to the US rose to US$2.53 billion in 2016, from US$1.25 billion in 2013.â€œApart from the exemption on thin film technology solar products, exemption from duty is also imposed on solar cells less than 2.5 gigawatt,â€?

"President Joko â€œJokowiâ€? Widodo used The Avengers analogy at the World Economic Forum in Hanoi recently to argue that he was among the superheroes opposed resolutely to the idea of trade wars.The comparison is an apt one. Although he declined to identify Thanos in the real-world scenario, the Indonesian leader definitely repudiated the notion â€” embodied in that character â€” that some must die so that others can survive in a world beleaguered by limited resources and population growth.That Malthusian idea belongs to a pretechnological era, in which the survival of the fittest meant just this savage war of each against all. That was all the state of nature made possible. Today, technology has emerged as a source of great empowerment, so that more people can share what the Earth has to offer. But they must maximize the use of technological, human and natural resources.Trade exemplifies the benefits of human competition through cooperation. The international division of labor gives nations a stake in one anotherâ€™s prosperity. The global production chain that runs through countries like a golden thread integrates them into trade and investment networks of prosperity.Thus, China does not rise at the United States expense; each rises because of the other.Admittedly, there are winners and losers in every nation. Those who can make the most of technological know-how profit the most. Those who cannot, do not. Companies and workers in the US that kept up with change prospered. Those who could not suffered. But that holds true of workers in China, India, Indonesia and Singapore as well.However, globalization prevents the emergence of national winners and losers. Would the US be at the vanguard of economic and technological change today but for globalization, a process that it â€” more than any other country â€” unleashed? America is a victor, not a loser, in the contest called globalization.It is true that China would not have taken its unbelievable economic leap forward without access to global markets, but could those markets have become truly globalized in Chinaâ€™s absence? It is Chinaâ€™s competitive presence in global markets that has helped America move even higher. That is the paradoxical consequence of economic competition: It is a form of cooperation.This is why the oncoming trade war between the two global giants is so worrying. It is one thing for nations to spar at the World Trade Organization (WTO), whose dispute resolution mechanism exists precisely to allow them to joust peacefully.Tariffs are a different game altogether. They are the bullets of trade; they kill, maim and destroy the ecosystem, in which international trade can work for the collective good of mankind.Indeed, there is a danger that trade wars will lead to real wars. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act helped trigger the Great Depression, which in turn, led to World War II. Beggar-thy-neighbor policies boomerang ultimately on proponents by shrinking the economic pie and making recourse to arms a natural alternative. If that alternative is tempting enough, great powers go to war and drag smaller nations with them into the quagmire.It happened once. It can happen again.If threats are taken seriously, it might be possible to find a solution to them. In the current global context, which is characterized by the countervailing strategies of the US and China, other economic players must throw their weight behind what they think is best for the global economy.The WTO possesses both the legitimacy and clout to stay the course of globalization. The European Union is no pushover, even with Brexit looming. The Group of Seven and Group of 20 nations, the latter being more representative of the global economy than the former, both play a role in rejecting protectionism among their members.Closer to home, ASEAN must retain its institutional ability to act as a common platform for its members in their dealings with the economic superpowers. This is easier said than done. Faced with the threat of protectionism, and the response to it, severing the links that bind ASEAN nations into global value chains of production, the easy choice is to bandwagon with one power or the other at the expense of ties with fellow ASEAN nations.This would be the economic equivalent of strategic bandwagoning. Once the race to the bottom begins, nations enter a common free fall that negates years of learning to rise through cooperative competition. They compete to weaken others. Sadly, that is the process that the US has inaugurated with China. The victims will include ASEAN countries.The regional grouping must respond to the challenge by displaying its capacity for coherence that was apparent during the Vietnam War and the Asian and global economic crises of the last century and this one. The danger is not that ASEAN would split, but that its members would go their separate ways in all but name.The Avengers is set in fictional terrain. It is possible to watch that terrifying film and still remain calm because its malevolent universe is unlike this one. But art is often a harbinger of reality.President Jokowiâ€™s role remains the most viable one for the rest of us as well.***The writer, a former Cabinet secretary, is a senior analyst at P8 think tank, Jakarta.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"â€œIf I was a US farmer, Iâ€™d be very cranky with Donald Trumpâ€?.Thatâ€™s National Farmersâ€™ Federation (NFF) President Fiona Simsonâ€™s understatement, made after the US President launched his second significant trade salvo is as many weeks; this time directed at the booming Chinese agricultural export market.But Ms Simson says bad news for US agriculture on the back of Donald Trumpâ€™s burgeoning trade wars also represents good opportunity to enhance exports for Australian farmers.Mr Trumpâ€™s announcement late last week that about US$60 billion worth of tariffs would be slammed on Chinese imports arrived shortly after he revealed a 25pc tax on imported steel and a 10pc on aluminium.That move sparked angry backlash and immediate calls to reverse the Presidentâ€™s protectionist policies, for fear of being stranded in the cross fire of a tit-for-tat trade war, from American farmers.But on Friday, Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Commerce announced a list of 128 tariff measures on US farm imports, amounting to about US$3b, in retaliation to the steel and aluminium tariffs.While the US$3b is not seen as being overly significant in terms of the overall trade volume between the two countries at about US500b, a spokesperson said the list targets US farm exports like fresh and dried fruit, pork and pork products, wine and nuts, that now face reciprocal Chinese taxes of 15pc and 25pc.Fears have also been expressed by US grain farming leaders that soybeans will be in the firing line of the new tariff wall Mr Trump announced against China late last week with wheat and corn also set to suffer.American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall said if the trade situation continued to deteriorate, â€œour lives as farmers and ranchers will become more difficultâ€?.He said Americaâ€™s farmers and ranchers exported more than US$20b of farm products to China â€“ more than 15pc of all US agricultural exports.â€œAfter Canada, China is our second-largest customer for ag exports,â€? he said.â€œIn retaliation for what our government says are justified US trade measures against China on intellectual property issues, Chinese officials now have indicated they are prepared to slap tariffs on US pork, wine and fruit.â€œOur farmers and ranchers depend on trade for a living and we are very concerned about retaliation resulting from the tariffs.â€œChina is an important market for US pork, and with about US$1b worth of it going to China and Hong Kong, itâ€™s our second-biggest market.â€œThis will really hurt US pork producers.â€?Mr Duvall said farm income across commodities had fallen by about 50pc over the past four years and retaliation in the trade arena â€œmakes our outlook even worseâ€?.â€œThis could not be happening at a worse time for American agriculture,â€? he said.â€œWe expect all countries to trade fairly and we support enforcement of trade rules.â€œBut we also hope trade disputes can be resolved without harming an industry that is a bright spot on trade and is so important to rural America.â€?China is Australiaâ€™s largest agricultural export market valued at $10.3b in 2016 which has climbed from $6.6b in 2011 led by wine, wool, beef, grains, dairy and sheep and goat meat with those exports boosted by tariff cuts in the free trade agreement that came into play in late 2015.Ms Simson said the US was one of Australiaâ€™s biggest export competitors in major farm commodities like beef and when they pulled out of trade deals like the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) - recently re-signed among the 11 remaining countries including Australia â€“ or imposed tariff barriers on China, it had an upside for local exports.â€œThe very fact that Australian farmers have access to markets, at competitive tariffs, in some cases better than the access thatâ€™s available for some of our biggest competitors, it does mean good things for Australian farmers,â€? she said.â€œThe NFF position on trade is that we should have a level playing field throughout the world when it comes to trade so we welcome competition from the US and we welcome the US coming into markets and opening up markets and we believe opening free trade is the best way to proceed.â€œHowever, it we have preferential access to some of the worldâ€™s biggest markets and US farmers are unable to access those markets, then certainly our farmers will reap some rewards and receive benefits that are not there for US farmers.â€œAsia is one of our biggest markets and the proximity of Asia to Australia makes it one of our preferential markets.â€œTo be able to negotiate lower tariffs into markets like Japan for our red meat, through the TPP, those sorts of arrangements are not open to the US farmers.â€œSo if I was a US farmer, Iâ€™d be very cranky with Donald Trump.â€?Ms Simson said in contrast, the Australian government was doing a â€œgreat jobâ€? in terms of opening up markets.â€œAustralian agriculture is very export dependent â€“ we do need access to markets and we donâ€™t have enough population to sustain our own agricultural industry,â€? she said.â€œWe do a great job of feeding people throughout the world and they love our products because of the provenance and quality of our products so we need to have markets and doors opened to be able to sell those products.â€œAnd if we can do so in a way thatâ€™s preferential to our biggest competitors like the US, thatâ€™s a win for Australian farmers.â€?US farmer backlashThe US Wheat Associates and National Association of Wheat Growers (NAWG) said they understood the need to enforce international trade rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) but â€œwe are very concernedâ€? about the implications of the Trump Administrationâ€™s decision to impose more than $60b in tariffs on Chinese goods.â€œRecent actions including withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and implementing steel and aluminium tariffs on the basis of national security have already undermined US leadership in international trade,â€? a statement said.â€œNow this action further erodes historical support for rules-based trade policies, even though China will likely bring a case against the tariffs within the WTO dispute settlement process.â€œIn addition, USW and NAWG fear that applying unilateral tariffs could invite retaliation that, as recent history shows, would be aimed at US agricultural products.â€œThis could very well include China throwing up road blocks to US soybeans, wheat, corn and other commodity imports, which would cut into already unsustainable farm incomes.â€œWe welcome the administrationâ€™s strong support for enforcing trade rules.â€œWe only wish it would have challenged Chinaâ€™s state-driven policies in ways that complied with and strengthened existing trade rules. â€œGrainGrowers market analyst Luke Mathews said currently there was zero Australian soybean exports to China but canola is exported as a soybean substitute.He said China had historically been an important market for Australian canola but the European Union had dominated in recent years.â€œThere is much excitement that the China-US dispute will further strengthen Aust-China grain trade relationships, particularly for sorghum and barley,â€? he said.â€œChina is already Australiaâ€™s most valuable grain trading partner, and the general feeling from the past few days in China is that both sides have a commitment to further strengthen this relationship.â€?Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Donald Trump had indicated last weekâ€™s tariffs on China were the beginning of a negotiation.â€œHis contention is that trade should be fair and reciprocal - we understand that - that is the reason why Australia has been exempted from the steel tariffs,â€? he said.â€œAs Donald Trump said, trade between Australia and the US is fair and reciprocal with zero tariffs on US imports into Australia.â€œWe have a very close security relationship and America actually has trade surplus with Australia and we donâ€™t complain about that.â€œWeâ€™ve got surpluses with other countries.â€œSo the important thing is no one wins in a trade war, no doubt about that.â€œWe look forward the US and China to being able to negotiate a satisfactory arrangement that suits both sides.â€?Mr Turnbull said Australiaâ€™s focus should be on supporting good constructive negotiations.â€œPresident Trump has talked about how much he respects President Xi,â€? he said.â€œI have been with them and the two men see eye-to-eye in every respect â€“ they are about the same height, both big guys â€“ and I look forward to them being able to negotiate.â€œBut I donâ€™t want to speculate on actions that havenâ€™t been announced.â€œWeâ€™ve got a free trade agreement with China which has been very important for agriculture.â€œWeâ€™ve seen a massiveâ€¦64pc increase in wine exports alone to China since the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement came into play.â€?Mr Turnbull said other markets had opened up through a free trade agreement with Peru recently and the TPP while a free trade agreement with Indonesia was also being worked on and one with the European Union.â€œAll of these things are hard by the way. Free trade agreements, itâ€™s not an easy glide path and you have setbacks, there are hills and hollows in the road you pursue,â€? he said.â€œBut my job as Prime Minister is to make sure that I create the best opportunities for Australian businesses to export, because that means they invest and that means they create more jobs.â€?Mr Turnbull said through the TPP on beef alone Australia had a competitive advantage against US ranchers with a â€œmuch lower tariffsâ€?.â€œIt is my job as Prime Minister to fling open as many doors for Australian exports as I can,â€? he said.â€œThose that are open, get them open even more, because we are the best.â€œWe can compete on the biggest, broadest playing fields around the world (in agriculture) to ensure we can produce the food we require and to take advantage of those opportunities.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many countries in the region will feel â€œknock-on effectsâ€? of rising tariffs because they are tied to supply chains that feed into Chinese exports, World Bank's Sudhir Shetty said. â€” Reuters picJAKARTA, April 12 â€” The World Bank warned that a trade war between the US and China will hurt economies in Southeast Asia since they rely on exports for growth.Many countries in the region will feel â€œknock-on effectsâ€? of rising tariffs because they are tied to supply chains that feed into Chinese exports, Sudhir Shetty, the World Bankâ€™s chief economist for East Asia and Pacific region, told reporters in Jakarta today.â€œA lot of those, although they may finally be assembled and put together and exported as Chinese products, are the result of a value chain that stretches across this region, particularly in some of the largerâ€?

"Harsh V Pantâ€˜This is a high-stakes strategic conflict between a power which wants to preserve the status quo in its favour and one which wants to usurp that throne.â€™â€˜The rest is all theatre,â€™ says Harsh V Pant.It is a full-on trade war between two of the mightiest global powers and both sides are trying to play hardball.After imposing tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods in July, US President Donald J Trump ratcheted up the pressure by going in for another $16 billion worth last month and ordering his administration to prepare to collect tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese trade on top of that.China has responded with its own set of reciprocal sanctions on the US products.There is a possibility that the two sides are getting ready for talks but ahead of those talks, President Trump is planning to impose a fresh round of tariffs on Chinese products to increase pressure on Beijing.Mr Trump has long accused China of unfair trade practices such as subsidies, currency manipulation and, in particular, of stealing American intellectual property in the form of cutting-edge technology.Against this backdrop, Chinese President Xi Jinpingâ€™s flagship â€˜Made in China 2025 initiative is viewed with suspicion as it is aimed at strengthening Chinese foothold in key industrial sectors, including pharmaceutical products, aircraft and robotics.This is reflected in the US trade representativeâ€™s description of the initiative as part of a plan of â€˜seizing economic dominance of certain advanced technology sectors.â€™While one can view these developments as a function of President Trumpâ€™s worldview, there is a wider shift happening in the US in so far as China is concerned.There is a fundamental re-evaluation of Americaâ€™s China policy going on at the moment with questions being raised about the nationâ€™s past posture.As a 2017 report from the US trade representative to the US Congress underscores: â€˜It seems clear that the United States erred in supporting Chinaâ€™s entry into the WTO on terms that have proven to be ineffective in securing Chinaâ€™s embrace of an open, market-oriented trade regime.â€™These concerns about Chinaâ€™s economic behaviour are not Americaâ€™s alone. A number of other leading trade powers, including the European Union, share these concerns.The EU, for example, has been asking China to deal with its excess steel and aluminium capacity, and has even complained to the WTO about the theft of intellectual property and high-end technology.Foreign companies wanting to operate in China have to work with a Chinese partner in a way that means they can easily lose control of their technology. But the EU has refrained from unilaterally imposing additional trade barriers on China like the Trump administration.While China has responded with a tit-for-tat approach in retaliating against the US, the future will be difficult for Beijing because China imports much less from the US than it exports there.There have been reports about the growing criticism of Xi in China as the future economic prospects of the country look tough.Since the end of the Cold War, the American strategy vis-a-vis China was premised on the assumption that the more the US engages China, the faster China would become more like the US and emerge a responsible stakeholder in managing a global order set by the US and its allies after the end of the Second World War.But this strategy has a fatal flaw: Major powers react to their own set of structural incentives, they donâ€™t necessarily respond to the assumptions underpinning the policies of their competitors.The US policy critically underestimated the resolve of the Chinese Communist party to maintain its position in the nationâ€™s domestic politics and its will to global power.This will has been repeatedly manifest in the Chinese behaviour on issues from East and South China Seas to the Belt and Road Initiative and Chinaâ€™s military build-up.Where in the beginning, Chinese leaders were cautious in challenging the US for global hegemony, there is now a real sense in Beijing of having arrived and it wants the global order to reflect its interests and values.This is well recognised in the US today.As compared to the past, there is now a greater awareness of how China has manipulated the international system to serve its agenda. And so the pushback on the economic front is the first major attempt to redirect US-China ties.In global relations, economic order rests on the political order.Under the garb of a trade war, this is a high-stakes strategic conflict between a power which wants to preserve the status quo in its favour and one which wants to usurp that throne.The rest is all theatre!Harsh V Pant is Director, Studies, Observer Research Foundation, New Delhi, and Professor of International Relations at Kingâ€™s College, London.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dr Mayengbam Lalit Singh (Asst Professor, Dept. of Economics, Kha-Manipur College, Kakching)Many economists advocate the essence of free trade for the welfare of consumers across the world. For decades, WTO has been working hard for a world without protective tariff. As a result, various countries formed Free trade Area (FTA) under GATT article XXIV. However, the recent decision by Trump to levy tariff on those imported goods from its partners emerges as paradigm shift in economic history. This article analyses why USA patronised free trade in the past decades and advocates protective tariff recently.According to economists, free trade implies trade without protective tariff on imported items. Free trade increases welfare being of consumers which is measured in terms of consumersâ€™ surplus. However, levying protective tariff reduces the said surplus which is accompanied with revenue collection by government. The worst part of protective tariff is dead weight loss where the said consumersâ€™ surplus is collected neither in the form of revenue nor surplus. After Second World War, the west ie. USA and European countries were witnessed with technological breakthrough in manufacturing sector. Both USA and European Union (the present) rushed up in the formation FTA with their neighbouring countries. USA initiated North Atlantic Free Trade Area (NAFTA) whereas European countries started formation of EU. Despite the end of political and physical colonisation, they tried to colonise economically by setting up GATT, IMF. By virtue of FTA, these countries have free access of their wide ranging manufactured goods to the markets of partner countries vis versa. However, for developing and less developed countries, their access to the markets of developed countries are found limited. For instance, in NAFTA, free access of Mexico to the market of USA was limited to agro products (mainly coffee).In return, Mexico has to offer free market access of thousands of manufactured goods of USA. Similarly, in EU also, western countries namely, UK, France, Germany are the gainers due to their technological superiority whereas, agro based eastern European countries are the losers. There emerges lopsided development in FTA due to difference in market access capabilities across tradable goods. In Asia, Africa and Latin American the situation is found very less. Countries in these continents underwent different phases of industrialisation with the strategy of self sufficiency. They protected their infant industries with tariffs on the goods imported from the above mentioned developed countries and hence less market accessibility. However, these countries are backward in technological development and look for transfer of technology from the west.This was the situation speculated by the western manufacturing firms since long back. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia allowed western firms to set up client branches in their countries with capital. The western countries now need not export to these countries since their overseas branch will produce and supply to their markets. Among Asian countries, China globalised its economy since 1978 and it welcomed Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) especially from USA to its economy.Since then, USA companies started manufacturing items taking advantage of cheap labours and unlimited supply of raw materials. China inked FTA with USA in 1999 and became member of WTO in 2001. Since then China exported wide ranging manufacturing items to USA at cheap price which results in deficit in Balance of Payment (BoP) over the years. China is the only country which creates bubble of deficit in the economy of USA. On the other hand, policies of USA on war again terrorist and unregulated financial systems hamper its economy over the years. According to studies, number of middle class people and unemployed labours has been surfaced tremendously. This class of people turned into consumers of imported Chinese goods since they canâ€™t afford their meagre budget for high priced domestic goods. China on other hand mainly imported agro products from USA which results skewed BoP in bilateral trade.In order to correct it, Trump framed stringent trade policies such as withdrawing of bilateral FTAs. He levies tariff on the manufactured items (mainly steel and aluminium products) imported from China. Not only on Chinese goods, has he also proposed tariff on imported items from Mexico, Canada, EU. This turns into paradigm shift in the history of international trade.Now the world might see two blocks where one block consists of USA, EU, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Newzealand, Saudi Arabia, UAE, etc. Another block is led by BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and friendly developing countries of Latin America, Africa and Asia. Nowadays the second block is not lacking in technological development behind the former. Both Russia and China have technological breakthrough in manufacturing not only consumersâ€™ goods but also high-tech machines such as automobiles, electronic items, fighter jets, civil aircrafts, etc.There is high possibility of free trade among countries in intra block and restricted trade in inter blocks. Many economists opine that return of restricted trade which was prevalent during period before Second World War. If it takes place, this situation will not be favourable to poor consumers across the globe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trumpâ€™s tit-for-tat trade struggle with China may seem distant, but its impact will likely be felt in California.Chinese tariffs already imposed on 128 U.S. exports, along with threatened duties on another 106 products, will affect 2.1 million American workers in 40 industries, according to a study by the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C. nonprofit research group.Although Californiaâ€™s large and diverse economy tends to insulate it from a trade war, it nonetheless counts 287,000 jobs in businesses targeted by Chinese tariffs â€” more than any other state.At the annual California-China Business Summit in Beverly Hills Thursday, California Governor Jerry Brown urged greater cooperation with China, noting that the economies of China and the United States are inextricably linked.â€œGlobalization is here. We are not going to get rid of it,â€? Brown said.â€œAnd a trade war is stupid.â€?Tension between the U.S. and China has escalated in recent weeks as the Trump administration imposed tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports, and China retaliated in kind.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, along with trade advisers Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, traveled to Beijing Thursday for two days of talks to pressure China to cut its trade surplus with the U.S., protect American companiesâ€™ intellectual property and end discriminatory tactics against U.S. businesses.Get tech news in your inbox weekday mornings. Sign up for the free Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter.In California, businesses most affected by Chinese import duties so far include Los Angeles plastics factories, Napa Valley wineries, and Central Valley vegetable, fruit, and berry farms, according to the Brookings study.In agricultural counties such as Colusa and Napa, more than 14% of jobs are in industries targeted by the Chinese tariffs. The impact is more muted in cities and suburbs: In Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, no more than 1.3 percent of the four countiesâ€™ workforces are in affected businesses.â€œTrade diplomacy can often seem an international and faraway activity,â€? wrote Mark Muro, director of Brookingsâ€™ Metropolitan Policy Program, in the organizationâ€™s report.â€œHowever, when it comes down to specific lists of tariffs on particular products that Americans produce, from ginseng to airplanes, the high-level posturing of Washington and Beijing suddenly gets more real.â€?The largest U.S. sectors targeted by China so far are plastics (300,000 jobs), aircraft (230,000), pharmaceuticals (200,000) and fruit and nut tree farming (190,000 jobs). Other vulnerable businesses include wineries (60,000), breweries (58,000) and natural gas extraction (45,000).After California, the next most affected states are Texas with 156,000 jobs in impacted industries and Washington State with 154,000, according to the study.On Wednesday, the California Budget & Policy Center, a Sacramento-based think tank, published a paper warning, â€œThe tariffs adopted and proposed by China, in retaliation for the tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration, could have a significant negative effect on California companies and workers, because China is a key destination for many California exports.â€œMore than $16.4 billion in exports to China originated in California in 2017 (though not all of those goods were produced in California), making China the stateâ€™s third-largest export destination overall, after Mexico and Canada,â€? wrote the policy centerâ€™s senior analyst, Sara Kimberlin.â€œAgriculture is an area specifically targeted by the retaliatory tariffs proposed by China. California farmers exported $2.0 billion in agricultural products in 2016 to China (including Hong Kong), which ranked third as a destination for the stateâ€™s agricultural exports.â€?California technology firms may have been hurt by Chinaâ€™s predatory intellectual property practices, which Trump seeks to curb. However, most tech executives oppose protectionism, arguing it is likely to harm US workers and consumers.â€œUltimately, as tariffs reduce demand or profit margins for specific products, their effects will be felt most strongly at the local level, among the companies that produce those goods and the workers they employ,â€? Kimberlin wrote.Trumpâ€™s protectionist initiatives began in January with tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels, a key China export. In March, the administration announced levies on steel and aluminum, also partly targeted at China.China retaliated by imposing tariffs on 128 U.S. products to take effect on April 1.Trump then threatened new tariffs on 1,300 Chinese exports, worth $50 billion, especially machinery and high-tech components.China responded by proposing tariffs on 106 U.S. exports, including soybeans, cars and chemicals worth $50 billion.Finally, in early April, Trump announced the U.S. would consider more tariffs on another $100 billion in Chinese products. And last week, the administration indicated it may restrict imports of Chinese telecom equipment based on national security concerns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Americaâ€™s government declares â€œwarâ€? promiscuously â€” on poverty, on drugs, on cancer, etc. â€” except when actually going to war, which the nation has done often since it last declared war (on June 5, 1942, on Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary). But the incipient war du jour is being postponed. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says the Trump administration is â€œputting the trade war on hold.â€? The one with China, that is. Others can continue.The armistice-before-the-war is good news for farmers, who could use some. USA Today reports that the net income of U.S. farmers has fallen by more than half since 2013, to its lowest point since 2006, the steepest decline since the Depression. For this, blame productive farming around the world (supply outpacing demand), rotten weather in America, and perverse government in Washington. China and Mexico, responding to uncertainties caused by U.S. indignation (about China selling too much to consenting American adults, and about NAFTA enabling mighty Mexico to exploit America), are finding alternative sources of soybeans, pork and beef.There is nothing like a calamity for taking oneâ€™s mind off oneâ€™s troubles, and anti-immigration Republicans have another affliction for American farmers. The Wall Street Journal reports that about half of agriculture workers are undocumented immigrants. Because more Mexicans have left than entered the United States between 2009 and 2014, the immigrant agriculture labor force is aging â€” and moving to higher-paying construction jobs. The Journal: â€œAs farmers struggle to find workers, more production has moved abroad. Avocado imports have doubled over the last eight years while U.S. production (measured by acreage) has declined by about a quarter. Since 1999, domestic production has fallen for oranges (by 36 percent), grapefruits (61 percent) and asparagus (69 percent). Imports of fresh fruits and vegetables have swelled. â€¦ This hurts workers in related industries like transportation and food processing.â€? This is the Republicansâ€™ approach to succoring â€œvictims of globalization.â€?Mortgage rates have risen to the highest level since 2011, they are far from done rising, and a National Association of Realtors economist says that every percentage-point increase can reduce home sales 7 to 8 percent. Simultaneously, the administrationâ€™s protectionism is further increasing the cost of homeownership with tariffs on imported Canadian lumber (framing lumber is about 18 percent of the average new homeâ€™s selling price). Bloomberg Businessweek says this adds an average of $1,360 to the cost of building a single-family home, the price of which has risen $6,388 since January 2017. Steel can sometimes be used as a substitute for lumber, except â€¦In the 1830s, in Grand Detour, Illinois, a young blacksmith designed a self-scouring steel plow that could turn the Midwestâ€™s heavy black topsoil. John Deere then started a company and now his name is on big green machines everywhere. Today, however, the administrationâ€™s steel tariffs are causing Deere & Co. to raise prices, which will injure its competitiveness, unless the demand for American machinery is price-inelastic. Perhaps the Trump administrationâ€™s protectionists, who know so much (how much Americans should consume of this and that import, and at what prices), know this about the machinery market.â€”â€”George Willâ€™s email address is georgewill@washpost.com.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US president Donald Trumpâ€™s tit-for-tat trade war with China appears to have caused a significant slump in Chinese visitors to the US that could cost the American tourism sector dearly this year, according to ForwardKeys.Weekly bookings from China to the US were up 2% from the last week of February (after the Chinese New Year holiday) to March 23 when the first tariffs took effect.Since then, ForwardKeys data shows the year-on-year figure to August is down by 8.4%, falling further as new rounds of tariffs have been announced.ForwardKeys said the negative impact on the Chinese currency, which has fallen 7.5% against the US dollar since tariffs were introduced â€“ meaning touristsâ€™ money buys less â€“ and warnings from Beijing about US travel security risks, have likely further influenced the trend.ForwardKeysâ€™ data reveals that for the rest of the year, Chinese outbound bookings to the US are 9.6% behind where they were at the same time last year, whereas Chinese outbound bookings worldwide are ahead by 5.5%.This pattern of growth worldwide but slowdown to the US is consistent in every month except October. A general setback in October is due to this yearâ€™s Mid-Autumn festival falling at the end of September, which draws departures at the start of the busy National Day Golden Week holiday into September from October.The biggest impact has been on bookings for group travel (six or more passengers) from China to the US, currently behind for the rest of 2018 by 34.4% compared to last year.FIT bookings are behind 3.9%, with leisure travel being worse affected than travel for business or travel to visit friends and relatives, ForwardKeys pointed out.By way of a benchmark, Chinese bookings for travel to Canada were up 4.8% to the end of July and are currently ahead 8.0% for August to December.ForwardKeys CEO and co-founder, Olivier Jager, said: â€œOur findings strongly suggest that president Trumpâ€™s trade war has had a significant impact on Chinese tourism to the US. Looking at the year to date, we see a setback in Chinese tourism arrivals of just under 5%. If that continues to the end of the year, we estimate that the cost to the US economy will be north of half a billion US dollars in 2018.â€œChinese spending in this sector is significant â€“ it amounts to the largest category of US services exports to China. It is unquestionable that the Chinese appetite for visiting the US is diminishing, and that is bound to worry the US travel industry.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"WASHINGTON â€” The escalating trade war between the United States and China poses crucial, though unanswerable, questions: Is this the beginning of the end of the post-World War II international trading system or will the present arrangements survive, as they have for 70 years?Almost certainly, historians will judge favorably the postwar expansion of trade (it has never been completely â€œfreeâ€? but has been liberalized substantially by removing many tariffs and quotas). It helped lift hundreds of millions of people from abject poverty and cemented the Cold War alliance of democratic societies against communism.Now, however, two problems cloud its future.First, global economic growth has slowed considerably, while inequality has increased. International trade and investment â€” aka â€œglobalizationâ€? â€” are now blamed (often unfairly) for these setbacks.Second, China has burst onto the global economy, rising from a backward country four decades ago to the worldâ€™s second largest economy. But its ascendancy, aside from challenging the United States (still No. 1), has been controversial, because China practices mercantilism: government policies intended to give its companies an advantage on global markets.President Trump portrays these policies â€” subsidies, trade preferences and the illicit acquisition of foreign technologies â€” as monstrously unfair to U.S. workers and firms. Unless China overhauls its economy to make competition more even-handed, Trump vows to do the job himself by imposing stiff tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States (in effect: taxes on Chinaâ€™s U.S.-bound exports).Thatâ€™s where we are now. Trade negotiations between the two countries have broken down, and Trump has announced 25 percent tariffs on a long list of Chinese exports, from soybeans to semiconductors to plastics. When fully phased in, the affected exports would total about $50 billion. The Chinese said they would retaliate with similar tariffs on the same amount of U.S. exports.Trump responded by asking the U.S. trade representative to prepare a further list of $200 billion of Chinese exports to be hit with 10 percent tariffs. If China retaliated, Trump threatened to add another $200 billion of Chinese exports.Nothing like this has happened since World War II. If this isnâ€™t a â€œtrade war,â€? what is it?Whether it portends an end to postwar trading system is unclear. Many economists are skeptical. They also doubt the trade war will plunge the U.S. economy into recession. The direct effect of the tariffs â€” which will raise prices, inspire retaliation and dampen some production â€” is â€œtiny,â€? says Nariman Behravesh, chief economist for IHS Markit, a consulting firm.Do some simple arithmetic, he says. A 25 percent tariff (tax) on $50 billion of Chinese exports totals $12.5 billion; another 10 percent on $200 billion of exports is $20 billion. Together, thatâ€™s $32.5 billion, not much in a $20 trillion U.S. economy.Economist Mark Zandi of Moodyâ€™s Analytics agrees but warns that imposing tariffs on most Chinese exports (around $500 billion in 2017) could cause a recession. So could some of his other trade proposals. These include, a 25 percent tariff on car imports and a repudiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada. The car tariffs alone could cost as many as 550,000 jobs, he says.There is a real dilemma: Chinaâ€™s mercantilist policies are bad, but so are Trumpâ€™s proposed remedies.The view that the present trade war wonâ€™t become more destructive assumes that China and the United States will find a middle ground that allows both to declare victory. But this is hardly guaranteed. â€œEven though itâ€™s an authoritarian country, public opinion [in China] matters,â€? says economist David Dollar of the Brookings Institution. Chinaâ€™s leaders canâ€™t be seen as capitulating to Trump. Trump probably feels the same way toward China.The defining characteristics of the postwar trading system have been reductions in trade barriers and the adoption of jointly-agreed upon rules, now enforced through the World Trade Organization (WTO), about whatâ€™s fair trade and what isnâ€™t. The United States played the leading role in this global project, though there has long been frustration with the rulesâ€™ complexity and their slow-motion operation.â€œThe United States seems to be giving up on the WTO rules â€” which we helped create. Other countries may do the same,â€? says economist Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College and author of â€œClashing Over Commerce: A History of U.S. Trade Policy.â€?This would signal an unraveling of the postwar trading system and its replacement by a hodgepodge of bilateral and regional trading agreements â€” many already exist â€” with what consequences no one knows. The history of warfare is a long string of miscalculations by combatants on all sides. The same may also be true of trade wars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Trumpâ€™s bold â€˜protectionistâ€™ move of introducing import duties of 25% and 10%for steel and aluminum, respectivelyâ€“ and possibly more to come â€“ maybe more than just â€˜populismâ€™ and fulfilling a campaign promise. And why is the term â€˜populismâ€™ always used with a derogative slant? As if it was way below the intellect of those who deride it as addressing the thoughtless and primitive behavior by the people? Arenâ€™t politicians supposed to work for the people? Educate them with the truth instead of ridiculing them; giving them real news instead of â€˜fake newsâ€™ â€“ and giving them jobs and decent livelihood? â€“ Is that addressing â€œpopulismâ€??President Trump, or whoever directs him, may have noticed the steady decline of the American economy into a hollow war and service machine, with rising unemployment at the tune of more than 20% (though the fake statistics pretend otherwise, putting git below 5%); a country gradually choking on junk consumption, anti-Russia propaganda and a rapidly deterioration physical infrastructure and civil society.This unexpected protectionist decision may also be a genuine move against globalization â€“ which, as we know, is controlled by neoliberal economics and has in fact nothing to do with real economics. It is sheer criminalizing of economics. It has done enormous harm to the 99.9 % and benefitted only the 0.1% (or less). â€œMake America Great Againâ€? is supposed to address this fallacy. Bring production and jobs back, primarily for the domestic market and second only, for international trade, for trade that doesnâ€™t harm the local economy. This is a recipe which would also suit many European countries â€“ Greece is a case in point, but Spain, Italy, Ireland and even France would fall into the same category. â€œLocal production for local marketsâ€? is indeed the model that helped rescuing the US from the depression of the 30â€™s and Europe, in particular Germany, after WWII.The so-called Free Trade Agreements (FTA) and multi country Trade Agreements like, NAFTA, TTIP, and TPP â€“ the former being renegotiated and the latter two suspended â€“ are quite different from â€œlocal production for local marketsâ€?. They all, without fault, favor US corporationsâ€™ maximizing profit objective, but not the United States local economy. In so far Trump is right, when he says that all these trade deals have been bad for his countries. They were and are a bonanza for US corporations, but indeed bad for the US national economy, because they are incentives for more and more outsourcing of production and services into low labor cost countries.By granting corporations tax breaks and incentives to invest at home rather than in low-wage countries, and by levying import duties, President Trump is taking a decisive step â€“ maybe willy-nilly â€“ to rehabilitate a faltering US economy. Will it work? It might. Itâ€™s too early to say. Economy is no precise science, but rather the result of the dynamic interaction between different at times unpredictable elements. True economics are certainly not based on a set of blueprints;they are not black and white, as neoliberal theories would like us to believe. Real economicsdo not fit todayâ€™s most popular teachings of â€˜modellingâ€™ â€“ a complex linear approach of algorithm which produces desired results for propagating neoliberal ideas â€“ that depart from reality by a long shot. The fact of reestablishing trust in local labor, may have power way beyond that of capital investments.Trump capitalizes on this momentum and, simultaneously, may set a signal for the rest of the world to follow â€“ and for the end of globalization. Interestingly, he said at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos in January this year, that all the American partner countries should think, â€œMake my country great againâ€?. Isnâ€™t this a slap in the face of globalization?Of course, there will be noises of â€˜retaliationâ€™ by Europe, China, Japan â€“ so what? â€“ Steps of retaliation may actually trigger a political rethinking of globalized WTO propagated trade. It may reveal who are the winners and losers. It may have taken 30 years to realize that the winners are an ever-smaller corporate elite, while the bedrock of national economies, local labor, is the big loser. That is precisely the direction into which the neofascist West is moving â€“ towards selling the national economy out to corporate profits.The people are understandably unhappy.Todayâ€™s economists are in shock, whenever somebody dares questioning the mainstream globalizedeconomic models, depicting a linear right or wrong vision of the world. Remember George Bush â€“ â€œyou are eitherfor us or against usâ€?; the phrase that set the eternal war on terror in motion; the war that brought death to millions, intimidation to hundreds of millions and billions of profits to the war industry.Yet, we were and are still indoctrinated with the neoliberal norm, which consists of open-border trade, limitless cross-border transfer of capital â€“ but very restricted transfer of labor. And worst of all, today and for the last 100 years, is our (western) dollar-based monetary system (born from the Federal Reserve Act of 1913) that shapes and manipulates the western boom â€“ bust economy. Logic would rather dictate a reverse monetary system, where a nationâ€™s economic output is the basis for its monetary system, not the other way around.This monetary anomality has been driven to extremes with the US-dollarâ€™s offspring, the euro, which has zero connection with the European economy, let alone with the economy of each member country. The western monetary system on which international trade is based is a fraud, a mere house of cards, a Ponzi scheme, the collapse of which is inevitable.The Donald is a largely unpredictable character. As a war monger, he screams â€œfire and furyâ€? at North Korea, threatening to wipe out the entire country; yet is willing to sit down to negotiate with Kim Jong-un â€“ under certain conditions â€“ debating whose Red Button is bigger, Kimâ€™s or the Donaldâ€™s. At the same time, driven by Netanyahu, the same Donald has only slander and insults left for Iran, threatening the country with annihilating war and imposing more sanctions, knowing quite well that Europe, mainly France and Germany, has established billion euros worth of trade relations since the lifting of the original sanctions after the signing of the â€˜nuclear dealâ€™ in July 2015.So, letâ€™s not get this wrong. Trump is no panacea for the good of the world. By a very long shot. He is a loose cannon, shooting from the hips, he may have hit the target by declaring unilateral import tariffs on steel and aluminum. This may be just the beginning, a trial balloon so to speak, for more protection measures to follow. His neocolonial trained chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, canâ€™t see the logic and quit. Trump is unmoved and stays the course. He knows these tariffs wonâ€™t affect consumer prices at home, butthey may be a boost for the US rust-belt â€“ reviving investments, including the local car industry, a key economic indicator, creating thousands of much needed jobs and reestablishing laborâ€™s trust in Washingtonâ€™s leadership â€“ to â€œMake America Great Again.â€?[Peter Koenig is an economist and geopolitical analyst.

"COLUMBUS â€” Ohio farmers and soybean producers should be very worried about the possible trade war with China, in addition to the ongoing concerns about trade with the NAFTA re-negotiations, according to Dr. Ian Sheldon, Ohio State Professor and Andersons Chair of Agricultural Marketing, Trade and Policy.â€œWe are failing to follow logical processes of dealing with China and influencing the way trade occurs,â€? Sheldon said Monday. â€œTariffs are not a good way of doing it.â€?Last week, President Donald Trump signed an executive memorandum that would impose tariffs on Chinese imports of up to $60 billion. China retaliated Friday with its own set of levies, drawing up a list of 128 U.S. products that could be possible retaliation targets.When asked about China accusing the U.S. of breaking international rules, Sheldon said that the U.S. has appealed to the argument that steel and aluminum imports are undermining national security. He said that national security is a subjective concept and is a â€œdangerous track down which to go.â€?â€œThe more we ratchet up our tariffs the more [China] will respond,â€? said Sheldon. â€œThe national security argument is a dodgy one. The World Trade Organization is not working well in controlling China.â€? He said that the more the US increases tariffs, the higher the potential for China to target specific commodities, including soybeans.On Monday, however, there were reports that trade tensions between the U.S. and China may be easing â€” slightly.The Financial Times reported China has offered to buy more semiconductors from the U.S. to help cut its trade surplus with the U.S. The Wall Street Journal also reported that U.S. and Chinese officials are working to improve U.S. access to Chinaâ€™s markets, according to CNBC.Investors â€œhave apparently recognized that a trade war is in no oneâ€™s best interests and therefore extremely unlikely,â€? said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, in a note. â€œSpecifically, the President merely wants to fulfill a campaign promise while China will only enact token countermeasures to appease its citizens.â€?Any trade taxes or tariffs between the two countries would go into effect in April, at the soonest.Highland County farmer Nathan Brown said he has faith that President Donald Trump knows what he is doing in the present trade-tariff showdown.â€œI hope our president knows what he is doing,â€? Brown said Monday. â€œAs a farmer and part of the rural community that supported the president, if this tariff ends up hurting the farmers, it would be a slap in the face. If prices fall it could be really detrimental to the agriculture community.â€?Brown pointed out that as president, â€œWhat he (Trump ) has done so far has been favorable to the farming community.â€?Brown, a member of the Ohio Farm Bureau Board of Trustees, has been to China to see just where his soybeans go. Several years ago, as part of a U.S. Soybean Export Council tour, Brown toured Asian markets where American and Ohio soybeans are sold, including China and Viet Nam.â€œAs a soybean producer, it does make me a little leery,â€? he admitted. He pointed out that most of his soybeans head south to Cincinnati where they then head to China.But Brown is an optimist. This spring he will be planting grain on about 800 acres in Highland County, and 80 percent of it will be soybeans.He said that if the Chinese market does become more restrictive for American soybean producers, â€œThis could hinder us, or it could open up new markets and new opportunities for us.â€?Last last year, Rural Life Today reported that many Ohio grain producers were shifting their ratio of corn to soybean planting this season because of flat corn prices and relatively more profitable soybean prices.Beijing had previously indicated it will take action against the soybean and corn industries in retaliation for any U.S. tariffs on China. China is the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, taking $14.6 billion worth in the last marketing year â€” more than a third of the entire crop.China is also the American farmerâ€™s biggest customer, followed by Canada and Mexico in U.S. agriculture exports.On March 22, President Trump granted exemptions on steel and aluminum tariffs to the EU, South Korea, Australia, Brazil and Argentina â€” but not China.â€œNow that the U.S. has backed away from the other countries, it looks discriminatory against China,â€? said Sheldon. And he added that according to the World Trade Organization (WTO), thatâ€™s against the rules.WTO is the organization designed to regulate trade. Dr. Sheldon posed the question: why we are undermining the very institution mechanism that is made to deal with these issues?Sheldon said that if the true concern is the claim that China is stealing U.S. intellectual property, then the U.S. should file a proper dispute through the WTO. â€œThe U.S. should go through the proper international process before taking unilateral action to China,â€? Dr. Sheldon said.Sheldon added that another way the U.S. was trying to deal with this issue was the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) between 12 countries, which President Trump backed out of when he was elected.â€œThat agreement was going to put in place rules that are not in the WTO,â€? said Dr. Sheldon. â€œThe idea was to put in place a trade agreement that if China was to ever join it, they would have to play by those rules.â€?He said that by backing away from TPP, weâ€™ve given up an influence or a say of how China can trade with these with other countries.â€œWe would definitely be affected (by a trade war)â€? said Fayette County farmer Wes Montgomery.Montgomery and his family farm about 1,500 acres split between soybeans and corn. â€œIâ€™d say it is definitely a concern by us.â€? He added that it appears soybean prices have taken a hit since the tariff news spread last week.â€œAgriculture is pretty dependent on the export market.â€? Montgomery pointed out. Last season, he said they took a lot of their beans to Cincinnati, â€œAnd thatâ€™s where they go for export.â€?He said he and fellow farmers are keeping an eye on the trade situation, adding that Chinaâ€™s pork market depends on soybeans for their feed meal, and â€œthey would like to be less dependent on the U.S. for that meal.â€?Sheldon also touched on the possibility of Mexico and Canada dropping out of North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) if they donâ€™t accept the USâ€™s proposals. â€œThis could do a lot of damage to US agriculture because with prices being quite low, exports matter a lot,â€? he said.Sheldon said that this would lead to U.S. losing import market share and would drive down immediate prices, causing both medium and long-term effects.Nathan Brown https://www.urbanacitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2018/03/web1_Nathan-Brown.jpg Nathan Brown Jim Zhang of the U.S. Soybean Export Council, holds a handful of fish feed at an aquaculture facility on the outskirts of Shanghai, China in April, 2016.

"In the last few months, the US and China have been going back and forth over tariffs on numerous products, such as agricultural goods, automobile, chemicals, machinery, metals, and medical equipment. Further retaliatory tariffs are under consideration by both countries. This trade dispute between the two biggest economies in the world would have a cascading effect on other countries, including Vietnam, which already faces higher tariffs on steel from the US. The US and China are amongst the top trading partners for Vietnam, and the trade war could have a direct or an indirect impact, as Vietnamâ€™s products are part of Chinaâ€™s value chain.Impact of tariffsPositive impactsIf the tariffs are strictly restricted to China and do not affect the cross-border supply chain, Vietnamese exporters will be more competitive and will see an increase in demand for their products, especially textiles and garments.Vietnam could also serve as an alternative to China for investors. Already, the country is benefitting from China plus one strategy that involves investors in China shifting or expanding to other countries to increase market access, diversify risks, and reduce labor costs. The growing trade war will only hasten the shift, especially for labor-intensive consumer goods industry such as clothing, footwear, electronics, and electronics.Vietnam, an export-oriented economy, with the FDI sector accounting for the majority of the exports will attract more investors as manufacturers continue to restructure their supply chains to reduce the impact from the US tariffs on China.For most of the emerging economies, especially in Southeast Asia, the short-term effect may hurt some industries, but in the longer run, these economies will benefit.Negative impactsBeing an export-oriented economy has its advantages but also has its flaws, such as heavy reliance on foreign direct investment (FDI) and exposure to volatility in global markets. FDI firms in Vietnam dominate the exports, while domestic manufacturers continue to struggle.In addition, if the US imposes broader tariffs on China, it will affect the cross-border supply chain, which will affect Vietnamese exports to China that act as inputs for Chinese exports. This will be true for every economy that is part of the US-China value chain.China-based firms facing higher tariffs will redirect their raw materials exports towards Vietnam to maintain the balance, which will affect the local industries in Vietnam.Going forwardTo minimize the risks arising from trade disputes, Vietnam has to focus on increasing their market access. The country is already part of numerous free trade agreements (FTA), with two more major FTAs coming in effect in the near future, Comprehensive Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and EU-Vietnam free trade agreement (EVFTA). This will give Vietnam an opportunity to increase their exports to alternative markets.However, Vietnam suffers from under-developed supply chains, heavy reliance on imports of raw materials, and lack of supporting industries and it has to focus on removing these obstacles to not only survive such trade wars but also fully realize the benefits of its upcoming FTAs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US-China TRADE WAR Some will win, but many will lose on both sidesBiggest casualty: American agricultureAssociated PressBEIJINGChinaâ€™s threat to raise tariffs on U.S. exports could be a disaster for American soybean farmers but a boon to their Brazilian and Argentine competitors, European aerospace companies and Japanese whiskey distillers.Regulators picked products China can get elsewhere when they made a $50 billion list including soybeans and small aircraft for possible retaliation in a trade spat with Washington.That should help minimize Chinaâ€™s losses if U.S. President Donald Trump goes ahead with a planned tariff hike and Beijing responds, said economist Lu Feng at Peking Universityâ€™s School of National Development.â€œCompared with the U.S. list, which focuses on high-tech, Chinaâ€™s list is more diversified,â€? said Lu. â€œThe impact to Chinaâ€™s overall economy is under control.â€?The two sides have not set a date for raising duties. Trump has approved higher duties on Chinese telecoms, aerospace and other technology goods but left time to negotiate by announcing a comment period through May 11. Beijing says its timing depends on what Trump does.Already, the threat of disruption has jolted the business world. Share prices of American exporters of aircraft, farm equipment and grain sagged Wednesday after Beijing announced its list of 106 products.Others picked for a possible 25 percent rise in Chinese import duty include beef, electric vehicles, industrial chemicals, orange juice and tobacco.Losers, including Chinese consumers who might face higher food prices, will likely outnumber winners.While importers that buy big volumes of American soybeans and other goods might struggle to fill the whole gap, those shortfalls could create business opportunities for rival suppliers.â€œThe obvious â€˜winnersâ€™ would be the other major suppliers of these products,â€? said Adam Slater of Oxford Economics via email.The biggest impact of higher Chinese duties would fall on American soybean farmers. China accounted for almost 60 percent of their exports and $12.4 billion in revenue for the year that ended on Aug. 31.Farmers in Brazil, Argentina or Australia might step up to supply Chinese buyers who use soybeans as animal feed and to produce cooking oil.A 25 percent price hike for American pork, whiskey and tobacco could make sources in Europe, Russia, Japan and elsewhere more attractive.Itâ€™s unclear whether Beijing might try to make an exception for Chinese-owned U.S. exporters such as pork producer Smithfield Foods, whose owner, WH Group, opened a facility in Zhengzhou to produce its brands but uses meat imported from the United States.At the same time, American meat producers might save money if weaker Chinese demand depresses the price of soybeans they use to feed cows and pigs.Higher prices for American small aircraft and aviation technology also could give French and German competitors a chance to gain market share.U.S. aviation-related exports to China totaled $13.2 billion in 2016. That accounted for 58 percent of Chinese imports, giving potential rivals plenty of room to grow.â€œWe will continue in our own efforts to proactively engage both governments,â€? said Boeing Co. in a statement. â€œA strong and vibrant aerospace industry is important to the economic prosperity and national security of both countries.Other potential winners include developing countries that might replace China as a supplier to American markets, according to William Jackson of Capital Economics.Mexico produces many of the goods targeted for U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports such as televisions and electrical circuits, he said in a report. South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand export semiconductors and other technology.â€œTo the extent that the tariffs do result in the U.S. importing from elsewhere, other emerging markets might stand to benefit,â€? wrote Jackson.â€”â€”â€”AP Writer Sam McNeil and AP researcher Yu Bing contributed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"New York Farmers are generally celebrated at the New York State Fair. But today some of those farmers made a call from the fairgrounds to end tariffs and a trade war they say is hurting them and local economies.New York farmers hope for more open markets to increase their revenue.Johanna Fox-Bossard of Barbland Dairy Farm in Fabius says sheâ€™s losing up to $3000 dollars a day due to tariffs on cheese and would like to see more open markets.â€œWe did get some good news this week that the United States and Mexico have reached a deal in principle on NAFTA. But it isnâ€™t a done deal yet. And we need Canada at the table. We need to get Ag Markets to where they were before the tariffs and trade wars ever began.â€?State Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets Richard Ball worries about both the cost and lost relationships, when tariffs cause other countries to buy elsewhere.â€œThe national Milk Producers Federation estimates that across the country the retaliatory tariffs with Mexico are costing dairy producers $1.8 Billion. So with New York State representing nearly 7% of dairy exports of the countryâ€™s milk production, New York State dairy farmers are realizing $125 million challenge.â€?The tariffs are not just on dairy; theyâ€™re also impacting New York soybeans, wine, maple and apples. Further, tariffs on steel are driving up the cost of farm equipment. Farm Bureau President David Fisher adds the recent trade tensions come at a time that was already tough.â€œNet farm income was already down about 50% before the trade wars began. When times are tough, this is when the country needs to be looking for new opportunities to expand our markets.â€?Farmers for Free Trade joined the announcement, along with representatives from corn and maple growers.

"China's ambassador to the United States says his country is 'ready to make a deal' to end a trade war with the United States â€” if they could find a trustworthy partner in Washington.Cui Tiankai accused the United States of shifting positions and passing up opportunities for agreement. The United States has been escalating tariffs on imports from China, and China he responded with taxes on U.S. goods.Amid rising tension, the veteran Chinese diplomat sat for a wide-ranging interview at NPR headquarters Wednesday. He offered a window into some of the frustrations of the world's most important international relationship, as a dominant power spars against an increasingly powerful one. The fight pits China's deeply entrenched leader Xi Jinping against the unpredictable President Trump.Cui, elegantly dressed and silver-haired, asserted that the trade war could be resolved through 'good faith.''We are ready to make some compromise,' he said, but in recent negotiations 'the U.S. position keeps changing all the time, so we don't know exactly what the U.S. would want as priorities.'The Chinese government, he said, is willing to take steps to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, which is a central complaint of President Trump. He asserted that China is also willing to commit to 'reforms' to China's economy, where state-supported firms often compete for business with built-in advantages against foreign competitors. The U.S., he said, must clarify what it wants.'More than once' in recent months, the ambassador said, 'we had some tentative agreement between the two working teams, then just overnight, the tentative agreement was rejected, and the demand from the U.S. changed. So this is very confusing.'White House officials have not described China as so accommodating. In an interview last month on NPR, presidential trade adviser Peter Navarro insisted that ending the trade war 'is all up to China,' and that 'if China stops their unfair trade practices, it's over.' Navarro said China 'basically cheat[s] us,' and he repeated demands that have been made, with little success, by administrations from both parties, such as better protection of intellectual property rights in China. The U.S. especially wants China to allow American firms to do business there without being forced to share technology.Ambassador Cui said he, like other diplomats, has tried every means to better understand Trump. Deeming U.S. policy statements inconsistent ('If people tell you one story one day and a different story a different day, then you're confused'), he has turned to the president's Twitter feed. 'If it's written by the president, it has to be meaningful,' Cui said.China's chief diplomat also obtained the Bob Woodward book Fear, which chronicled chaos and dysfunction in the White House. 'I certainly have a copy,' he said. 'I have talked to many other ambassadors here. We all share the same concern. All of us want to have a better understanding of what is happening here, and what it would mean for us.'Cui urged the White House not to follow up on a reported idea to bar Chinese students from American universities, which he called 'very dangerous,' saying that 'people-to-people contacts' offer a 'foundation of friendship.'But he demurred when asked if China would allow more openness: welcoming more journalists or scholars to sensitive areas of his country, such as the Xinjiang region, home to majority-Muslim Uighurs, and traditionally Buddhist Tibet.Xinjiang, he insisted, faces a threat of 'terrorism,' while journalists must stay away from Tibet because of its 'very high altitude.'Copyright 2018 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.DAVID GREENE, HOST:China's ambassador believes the United States needs to make up its mind. Cui Tiankai says the United States doesn't seem to know what it wants on trade in the middle of this escalating conflict. Cui is China's man in Washington, this elegantly dressed, diplomatic veteran, and he sat down with Steve Inskeep for a rare interview.STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: What is preventing an end to the trade war with the United States?CUI TIANKAI: We certainly don't want to have a trade war with the United States or with any other country.INSKEEP: You have one.CUI: Yeah. This is very unfortunate. But we want to solve it. We do need goodwill and good faith from both sides.INSKEEP: Are you seeing goodwill or good faith from the United States?CUI: Well, tell you the truth, not sufficiently.INSKEEP: What is the evidence of that?CUI: Well, for instance, the U.S. position keeps changing all the time so we don't know exactly what the U.S. would want as priorities. We are ready to make a deal. We are ready to make some compromise, but it needs the goodwill from both sides.INSKEEP: Ambassador, you used the word priorities. I'm reminded that a few months ago, the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin went to China for some negotiations, and it was said that the United States made a very wide range of demands that were rejected out of hand by China. Is that what you mean by priorities, that you want the United States to pick a few items rather than demanding every complaint be fixed at once?CUI: Well, actually, in the last few months there have been contacts between the two governments. And we offered to reduce the trade deficit of the United States, for instance. And we also present a very good proposal to the U.S. side about the further reform and opening up in China. I think more than once we had some tentative agreement between the two working teams. Then just overnight, the tentative agreement was rejected and the demand from U.S. changed. So this is very confusing.INSKEEP: That, perhaps, leads to another question. What is your method for trying to determine what the president of the United States thinks?CUI: Well, we'll have to look at the policy statements. We have to look at what the U.S. team will tell us on the negotiating table. But I think that we still need more good faith. If people tell you one story one day and another story, a very different story, another day, then you are confused.INSKEEP: Do you follow the president's Twitter feed?CUI: Well, I think many people are following all the Twitters...INSKEEP: Millions. Sure.CUI: ...So we are just doing the same.INSKEEP: But do you find meaningful information there? Some of his political allies will say, disregard that, his actual policies are something else.CUI: Honestly, I think if it's written by the president, it has to be meaningful.INSKEEP: There was a news story here suggesting that foreign embassies and consulates were buying large numbers of copies of a Bob Woodward book about the inner workings of the White House. Is the Chinese embassy filled with copies of Bob Woodward's book?CUI: Naturally, people would like to get a copy and see what happens, what is written in the book.INSKEEP: Is that a yes? You have lots of copies of 'Fear' around the Chinese embassy?CUI: I don't know.INSKEEP: How about you?CUI: It's really up to the individuals whether they want to buy it or not. I certainly have a copy. So I have talked to many other ambassadors here. We all share the same concern. All of us want to have a better understanding of what is happening here and what it would mean for us.INSKEEP: Do you feel you understand the president at this point?CUI: Well, I hope that we could have a better understanding.INSKEEP: What have you thought about as there have been news reports that the administration has considered proposals to ban Chinese students from studying at American universities?CUI: If this is true, I think that this is a very dangerous situation because so many Chinese students are studying here, and a growing number of American students are studying in China. Such people-to-people contact would be the real foundation of friendship and the cooperation between the two great countries. And I could give you very specific examples. In the state of Indiana...INSKEEP: Indiana. Indianapolis, where I'm from.CUI: Yeah. There's a children's museum.INSKEEP: Sure. It's a great one.CUI: It's a great one. And a few years ago, the museum hosted a big, big event on Chinese culture, and I was invited to address the opening ceremony. And I had a meeting with then-Governor Mike Pence. Governor Pence was a great supporter to such people-to-people, intercultural exchanges. So why should we cut off all these ties, all the natural ties between our two peoples?INSKEEP: Would you encourage greater openness going the other way? If American scholars who may have controversial opinions want to visit China, if American journalists want to go to sensitive areas, like Tibet, would you encourage greater openness on China's part?CUI: You see, we are open to American students, professors, journalists or scholars. Of course, for some of the places, like Tibet, because it's very high altitude and the climate could be very tough there...INSKEEP: Very high altitude?CUI: Yeah.INSKEEP: I think American journalists and scholars could handle the altitude. I mean, we have high altitudes in the United States.CUI: Well, not everybody could quickly get used to such climate and natural conditions. Even for Chinese, many of them would not feel very well once they are there.INSKEEP: What about Uighur areas in far northwest China?CUI: Well, this is part of China. So the whole country is open to the rest of the world. Certainly, this part is also open. But, honestly, in this part of China, we have a particular problem that is terrorism. There are violent extremist groups. I'm sure some people, or there's some attempt to create a situation like the ISIS in that part of China.INSKEEP: What have you thought about as the United Nations has said that hundreds of thousands of people in Uighur areas have been put into camps?CUI: You see, very often, widespread stories may not be the true stories. I think whatever we are doing in that part of China is for the well-being and safety and security of the people there.INSKEEP: Are you putting people in camps to do that?CUI: It's not - you see, first of all, we have to take a measure to make sure that groups like ISIS will not be spreading in that part of China. Secondly, we have to make sure that people have a means to build a better life. For instance, they have to learn more skills. They have to learn techniques to develop themselves. And also we have to maintain local stability.INSKEEP: People will be listening carefully to your words.

"China said Sunday that it will not initiate a trade war with the United States, but vowed to defend its national interests in the face of growing American protectionism.â€œThere are no winners in a trade war, and it would bring disaster to our two countries as well as the rest of the world,â€? Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan said at a briefing on the sidelines of Chinaâ€™s annual parliamentary session.Advertisementâ€œChina does not wish to fight a trade war, nor will China initiate a trade war, but we can handle any challenge and will resolutely defend the interests of our country and our people,â€? he said.It was Beijingâ€™s latest statement on â€œproblems in Sino-U.S. economic trade and cooperation,â€? alluding to President Donald Trumpâ€™s plan to impose heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. The U.S. leader said Thursday that he was slapping tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum, temporarily exempting big steel producers Canada and Mexico.Chinese leaders have threatened in the past to retaliate against raised trade barriers, but have yet to take direct action following Trumpâ€™s announcement.Citing Chinese researchers, Zhong said the U.S. has been overstating its trade deficit with China by about 20 percent every year. He gave no details on how this figure was reached, but the U.S. and Chinese governments generally report widely differing trade figures because Beijing counts only the first port to which goods go instead of their final destination.The U.S. reported a $375 billion deficit with China last year, so a 20 percent reduction would still be among the largest trade gaps that the U.S. has with any country.Zhong blamed the trade imbalance in part on controls over U.S. high-tech exports to China, repeating a Chinese claim that Washington could narrow its trade deficit if it allowed China to buy more â€œdual useâ€? technology such as supercomputers and advanced materials with military applications.U.S. officials have said such sales would make up only a small percentage of the deficit while possibly threatening American national security.The Trump administration earlier approved higher tariffs on Chinese-made washing machines, solar modules and some other goods, prompting Beijing to accuse Washington of disrupting global trade regulation by taking action under U.S. law instead of through the World Trade Organization.Liu He, Chinese President Xi Jinpingâ€™s top economic adviser, visited Washington earlier this month in an attempt to smooth strained ties.Zhong said China would continue to â€œrelax market accessâ€? to China and said China would also attach greater importance to intellectual property rights, another point of tension with the U.S.China absorbed $136.3 billion in foreign investment last year. The country has long been among the top global destinations for investment, but foreign enthusiasm is cooling. Surveys by business groups show companies are shifting emphasis to other Asian economies seen as more profitable or less restrictive.â€œWe have noticed that some foreign-funded businesses have complained about Chinaâ€™s investment environment,â€? Zhong said. â€œThe fact that they have complaints indicates that they are still paying attention to Chinaâ€™s development and have confidence in Chinaâ€™s market.â€?The commerce minister reiterated Premier Li Keqiangâ€™s promise on Monday to liberalize the manufacturing industry and expand the opening up of sectors such as medical care, education and new energy vehicles. Specific details were not given, but Zhong pledged to give equal treatment to domestic and foreign businesses alike while continuing to curb â€œirrational overseas investmentâ€? from within China.AlertMe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"BRUSSELS (AP) â€” The European Union says itâ€™s ready to retaliate against the U.S. over President Donald Trumpâ€™s proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum â€” with counter-measures against iconic U.S. products like Harley Davidson motorcycles, Leviâ€™s jeans and bourbon.The EU threat and Trumpâ€™s insistence that the tariffs will go ahead escalate the risk of a trade war, in which countries try to punish each other by increasing taxes on traded goods. In the end, that tends to hurt all sides as exporting producers suffer but so do consumers who face higher costs, experts say.There was some hope that free trade proponents in the White House, like economic adviser Gary Cohn, would dissuade Trump from going ahead with the tariffs. But Cohnâ€™s resignation Tuesday dealt a blow to that expectation.EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem said Wednesday that the EU is circulating among member states a list of U.S. goods to target with tariffs so that it can respond as quickly as possible.The list so far includes U.S. steel and agricultural products, as well as other products like bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries and orange juice.She did not say what level of tariffs the EU would set, leaving it unclear what the economic impact would be.â€œThis is basically a stupid process, the fact that we have to do this. But we have to do it,â€? EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had said Friday. â€œWe can also do stupid.â€?The EU considers itself to be caught in the crossfire of this particular trade dispute, in which Trump has mainly singled out China for being unfair in its commercial deals.Trump last week said his government would levy penalties of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum imports, but did not say whether traditional allies like the EU and Canada would be exempt. On Wednesday, Cabinet members suggested Canada and Mexico might escape and that the announcement was due at the end of this week.Once Trump officially announces the tariffs, they would start almost immediately, experts say.So the EU has moved ahead with preparations for the worst.Malmstroem said that the EU, the worldâ€™s biggest trading bloc, rejects Trumpâ€™s reasoning that the tariffs are backed by the international legal right to protect national security.â€œWe cannot see how the European Union, friends and allies in NATO, can be a threat to international security in the U.S.,â€? Malmstroem told reporters. â€œFrom what we understand, the motivation of the U.S. is an economic safeguard measure in disguise, not a national security measure.â€?The EU itself already has tariffs on many imports. But Malmstroem said Trumpâ€™s motives in this case do not appear compatible with World Trade Organization rules and that this means the EU can activate safeguards to protect its own markets.The WTO said Wednesday that, so far, 18 members â€” including China, Australia, Brazil, the EU, India, Japan, Norway and Russia â€” have expressed concerns about Trumpâ€™s proposed tariffs.At the origin of the problem is overproduction by China, which has flooded world markets with steel and aluminum, driving prices down and intensifying pressure on producers in the U.S. and Europe. Nearly half the steel produced globally in December, for example, came from Chinese mills, according to the World Steel Association. China accounted for more steel production than the United States, Russia, Japan and 28 countries of the EU combined.But the U.S. has already thrown up barriers to Chinese imports. As a result, China ranks only 11th in steel and fourth in aluminum imports to the United States. Trumpâ€™s tariffs appear far more likely to hurt a staunch ally, Canada, which is No. 1 in both supplies of steel and aluminum to the U.S.Chad Bow, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, estimates that Trumpâ€™s tariffs would cost Canada $3.2 billion a year and the EU $2.6 billion. By contrast, they would cost China only $689 million.EU Council President Donald Tusk, who chairs summits of presidents and prime ministers, said the blocâ€™s leaders will discuss the issue at their next meeting on March 22-23.He rejected Trumpâ€™s assertion in a tweet that trade wars are good and easy to win. â€œThe truth is quite the opposite: trade wars are bad and easy to lose,â€? said Tusk.Fragkiskos Filippaios, of the University of Kentâ€™s business school in England, says that the damage from a trade dispute will depend on whether the sides try to resolve their differences through the arbitration of the WTO, whose verdicts have so far always been accepted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Posted: Aug. 7, 2018 4:25 pmPALMYRA, Mo. -- U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill fears the tariffs that are sparking a trade war with China and other U.S. trading partners could hurt farmers for years to come.McCaskill found several farmers who felt the same way during a visit to the Lowell Schachtsiek farm near Palmyra on Monday. She said between one-quarter and one-third of all soybeans from Missouri have been sold to China in recent years.Tariffs announced earlier this year by President Donald Trump have been answered by China with tariffs against U.S. products including soybeans, pork and other items.'Let's assume we work out a deal in six months. By then China's got somebody else supplying their soybeans. They're already buying from Brazil, and China is paying their own farmers to plant soybeans,' McCaskill said.The two-term senator from Missouri agrees that the United States needs to go after China and other cheaters on international trade. But she said the tariff war that has brought the price of beans down was more like 'a 2-by-4 when we needed a scalpel.'One farmer said $8 soybeans represent a loss for some producers, depending on their input costs.Another farmer said Smithfield Foods, which is owned by China, operates many of the large pork farms in Monroe County and will be paying the big tariffs charged by the Chinese.A $12 billion subsidy for farmers has been announced by the White House to help ease the pain caused by the trade war. McCaskill said that will put the administration in the position of 'picking winners and losers.'Joe Maxwell, a farmer from Mexico and former lieutenant governor in Missouri, urged McCaskill to look for ways to boost farm profitability. Maxwell said consolidation of markets and the trade war leave farmers with few good options.Maxwell said next year farmers will have to decide what to plant based on the farm programs, rather than commodity markets.During a question-answer session in Schachtsiek's shop, McCaskill fielded some questions about why the U.S. doesn't expand Medicare to citizens of all ages.'When I ask how many people get health insurance through an employer, about two-thirds of the (audience members) raise their hands. Then when I ask whether they would like to trade that health insurance in for a policy where the government decides, well, guess what? They don't want to lose their coverage through the employer,' McCaskill said.She does, however, believe that Medicare should be offered to every American who reaches the age of 55, rather than the current enrollment age of 65.McCaskill also wants to see the federal government negotiate medicine costs.At this time Medicare and similar programs account for 40 percent of medicine purchases in the nation. Most large groups are able to negotiate lower prices, but federal law doesn't allow the government programs to do the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Published: Wednesday, April 04, 2018 @ 2:28 PMUpdated: Wednesday, April 04, 2018 @ 2:42 PMâ€” As the soybean industry assailed President Donald Trump today for launching a trade war with China, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said Trump assured him that farmers in Ohio and across the country â€œwill not be allowed to be the casualty in a trade dispute.â€?After an appearance before farmers here, Perdue acknowledged â€œthere is legitimate anxiety out hereâ€? because of Chinaâ€™s announcement it plans to impose a 25 percent tariff on imports of soybeans, a move which could cripple Ohio farmers who exported nearly $700 million of soybeans to China last year.Speaking to reporters, Perdue cautioned that the new tariffs unveiled in the past two days by the United States and China â€œare announcementsâ€? which â€œare not going to take effectâ€? immediately.â€œOur goal frankly is to get China to the table to discuss some of the unfair trading practices,â€? Perdue said.Sonny Perdue and SBA Administrator McMahon examine the sprinkler system at Amherst Greenhouse in Harrod on Wednesday morning.â€œWhile people have to be obviously concerned aboutâ€? the possibility of tariffs on soybeans, Perdue said â€œall I can do today is to tell you â€“ which I think is a pretty good assurance â€“ that the president of the United States has told the farmers of America that they will not be the causalities in this trade dispute.â€?Perdue was in Ohio as the threat of a trade war between China and the United States has rattled the markets. In a sharply worded statement, the American Soybean Association said â€œit should surprise no one that China immediately retaliated against our most important exports, including soybeans.â€?â€œWe have been warning the administration and members of Congress that this would happen since the prospect for tariffs was raised,â€? the statement said.Ohio farmers export about 60 percent of the soybeans they grow, meaning a trade war with China will hit them particularly hard.â€œIt has a potential to have a very negative impact on the soybean industry,â€? said Jennifer Coleman, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Soybean Council.The Chinese announcement took place just one day after the Trump administration vowed to increase tariffs on as many as 1,300 Chinese products. The actions by the United States and China raise fears that a trade war is looming which would damage the economies of both countries.The American Soybean Association said â€œsoybean futures are already down nearly 40 cents a bushel as of this morning. At a projected 2018 crop of 4.3 billion bushels, soybean farmers lost $1.72 billion in value for our crop this morning alone. Thatâ€™s real money lost for farmers, and it is entirely preventable.â€?â€œWe regret that the administration has been unable to counter Chinaâ€™s policies on intellectual property and information technology in a way that does not require the use of tariffs,â€? the statement said.Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who has supported a tougher trade policy against China, said â€œChina cheats - thatâ€™s what these tariffs are all about. So itâ€™s no surprise theyâ€™re playing dirty when we try to enforce the rules and we need to support industries that are hurt, including Ohio soybean farmers.â€œBut we canâ€™t be bullied out of standing up for American jobs by Chinaâ€™s threats,â€? Brown said â€œWe should use these tariffs to force China to the negotiating table and secure changes that benefit all U.S. industries.â€?Joe Cornely, senior director of communications for the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation, said one of every two rows of soybeans in the state gets exported â€œand a large share goes to China.â€?â€œItâ€™s not like we didnâ€™t see this coming,â€? he said. â€œEvery time there is a trade dispute, the first place they go for retaliation against the United States is agriculture. It happens literally every time, and thatâ€™s understandable because thatâ€™s the one place that they know will hurt.â€?China previously slapped tariffs on U.S. pork, which will also hurt. The U.S. produces 22 percent of Chinaâ€™s pork market. With prices on U.S. imports of pork escalating, Cornely predicts other countries will be happy to take the United Statesâ€™ share. â€œOther countries will probably be more than happy to ramp up their pork production,â€? he said.The impact, he said, will be felt throughout rural Ohio.â€œA hog farmer may be losing a lot of money , but there will be ripple effects as well,â€? he said. â€œThe local Ford dealer will not sell as many pickup trucks. The grocery will not sell as much food. People wonâ€™t go to as many movies. Because agriculture is such a driver of local economies in rural areas, this hurts more than just farm families.â€?(Jack Torry of the Washington Bureau contributed to this story.

"If a trade war is coming, the cheesemakers of Wisconsin are standing in the line of fire. So are the farmers of the Great Plains and the distillers of Kentucky. And the employees of iconic American brands like Harley-Davidson and Levi Strauss.The likelihood of a trade conflagration leapt closer to reality last week after the United States imposed tariff on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Infuriated, the jilted U.S. allies vowed to retaliate with tariffs of their own. And in a separate dispute, China is poised to penalize $50 billion in U.S. goods â€” many of them produced by supporters of President Donald Trump in the Americaâ€™s agricultural heartland.â€œTheyâ€™re going to hit the farmers,â€? said Bryan Klabunde, a farmer in northwestern Minnesota. â€œWe want things fair for all industries, but weâ€™re going to take the brunt of the punishment if other countries retaliate.â€?â€?Donald Trump, who entered office promising to rip up trade deals and crack down on unfair trading practices, is clashing with trading partners on all sides. To the north, heâ€™s battling Canada; to the south, Mexico; to the east, Europe; across the Pacific Ocean to the west, China and Japan.â€œThe president seems to be creating trade (and other) disputes with everyone â€” allies and adversaries alikeâ€”and itâ€™s difficult to discern any coherent strategy,â€? said Rod Hunter, a former National Security Council staffer under President George W.

Jeff Schwager, president of Sartori, a cheese company in Plymouth, Wisconsin, said of Mexico. Retaliatory tariffs â€œwill reduce sales â€” thereâ€™s no question.â€?â€œThe hard-earned sales weâ€™ve secured in Mexico could be at risk given the potential for retaliation,â€? the National Milk Producers Federation warned in a statement.The EU is threatening to penalize Kentucky bourbon and the motorcycles of Wisconsin-based Harley-Davidson. The potential tariffs pack a political punch: Theyâ€™d hurt constituents of House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican.Reporters in Louisville, Kentucky, asked McConnell if he thought the Europeans were trying to get his attention.â€œWell,â€? the Senate leader said, â€œthey got my attention. They didnâ€™t need to do that. These are our friends. These are not enemies. Canada and Mexico, Europe â€” these are our allies, and we need to work this out in a way thatâ€™s comforting to everyone.â€?Harley-Davidson has already absorbed higher steel and aluminum costs since Trump first announced the metals tariffs three months ago.

All of those products are vulnerable because we export significant amounts in those markets.â€?The milk market has been depressed for about three years, and farmers have struggled to break even. About 14 percent of U.S. milk production is exported; the largest customer is Mexico.â€œThis is the worst possible thing to have for our milk market, and itâ€™s the same for every other commodity,â€? Steffen said. â€œ These are important relationships.â€?In Stockton, California, Jeff Colombini is worried about the financial damage a trade war would bring to his 1,800-acre farm. His company, Lodi Farming, exports walnuts, cherries and apples to Mexico, Canada, the European Union and other countries.â€œWith these tariffs, itâ€™s going to make the product too expensive for the consumers in Mexico and in Canada and in the EU,â€? Colombini said. â€œWeâ€™re not going to be able to sell all of our crop. And so some of it is probably going to go unharvested or just dumped ...

"Written by Ken Thomas and Paul Wiseman/Associated Press | Mar 1, 2018 6:47 PMPresident Donald Trump speaks to reporters while touring H&K Equipment Company to promote his tax and economic plan, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2018, in Coraopolis, Penn. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)(Washington) -- Ordering combative action on foreign trade, President Donald Trump declared Thursday the U.S. will impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, escalating tensions with China and other trading partners and raising the prospect of higher prices for American consumers and companies.With 'trade war' talk in the air, stocks closed sharply lower on Wall Street.Trump said firm action was crucial to protect U.S. industry from unfair competition and to bolster national security. However, his announcement came only after an intense internal White House debate. It brought harsh criticism from some Republicans and roiled financial markets with concerns about economic ramifications.Overseas, Trump's words brought a stinging rebuke from the president of the European Commission. Though the president generally focuses on China in his trade complaining, it was the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker who denounced his plan as 'a blatant intervention to protect U.S. domestic industry.'Juncker said the EU would take retaliatory action if Trump followed through.Canada, the largest source of steel and aluminum imports in the U.S., said it would 'take responsive measures' to defend its trade interests and workers if restrictions were imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products.Should restrictions be imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products, Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers.'Trump, who has long railed against what he deems unfair trade practices by China and others, summoned steel and aluminum executives to the White House and said next week he would levy penalties of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum imports. The tariffs, he said, would remain for 'a long period of time,' but it was not immediately clear if certain trading partners would be exempt.'What's been allowed to go on for decades is disgraceful. It's disgraceful,' Trump told the executives in the Cabinet Room. 'When it comes to a time when our country can't make aluminum and steel ... you almost don't have much of a country.'The president added: 'You will have protection for the first time in a long while, and you're going to regrow your industries. That's all I'm asking. You have to regrow your industries.'Increased foreign production, especially by China, has driven down prices and hurt U.S. producers, creating a situation the Commerce Department has called a national security threat.However, critics raised the specter of a trade war, suggesting other countries will retaliate or use national security as a reason to impose trade penalties of their own.Trump's move will likely raise steel and aluminum prices here. That's good for U.S. manufacturers. But it's bad for companies that use the metals, and it prompted red flags from industries ranging from tool and dye makers to beer distributors to manufacturers of air conditioners. The American International Automobile Dealers Association warned it would drive prices up 'substantially.''This is going to have fallout on our downstream suppliers, particularly in the automotive, machinery and aircraft sectors,' said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official who is now vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute. 'What benefits one industry can hurt another. What saves one job can jeopardize another.'Steel-consuming companies said steel tariffs imposed in 2002 by President George W. Bush ended up wiping out 200,000 U.S. jobs.The decision had been strenuously debated within the White House, with top officials such as economic adviser Gary Cohn and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis raising concerns.The penalties were pushed by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, an economist who has favored taking aggressive action.Mattis, in a memo to Commerce, said U.S. military requirements for steel and aluminum represent about 3 percent of U.S. production and that the department was 'concerned about the negative impact on our key allies' of any tariffs. He added that targeted tariffs would be preferable to global quotas or tariffs.Plans for Trump to make an announcement were thrown into doubt for a time because of the internal divisions. The actual event caught some top White House officials off guard and left aides scrambling for details. Key Senate offices also did not receive advance notice.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the decision 'shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone,' noting that the president had been talking about it 'for decades.'But some Republicans in Congress were plainly upset.'The president is proposing a massive tax increase on American families. Protectionism is weak, not strong,' said Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska. 'You'd expect a policy this bad from a leftist administration, not a supposedly Republican one.'GOP Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said, 'Every time you do this, you get a retaliation and agriculture is the No. 1 target.' House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said through a spokesman he hoped Trump would 'consider the unintended consequences of this idea and look at other approaches before moving forward.'Trump met with more than a dozen executives, including representatives from U.S. Steel Corp., Arcelor Mittal, Nucor, JW Aluminum and Century Aluminum. The industry leaders urged Trump to act, saying they had been unfairly hurt by a glut of imports.'We are not protectionist. We want a level playing field,' said Dave Burritt, president and chief executive officer at U.S. Steel.Trump last year ordered an investigation into whether aluminum and steel imports posed a threat to national defense. Ross said last month that the imports 'threaten to impair our national security,' noting, for example, that only one U.S. company now produces a high-quality aluminum alloy needed for military aircraft.Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president has the authority to restrict imports and impose unlimited tariffs if a Commerce Department investigation finds a national security threat.Commerce recommended a number of options. The president's plan is more stringent than any of them.It was the latest move by the president to engage in trade actions after campaigning to revitalize the 'forgotten' workers of the country. Trump earlier raised duties on Chinese-made washing machines, solar modules and some aluminum and steel products to offset what he said were improper subsidies.___Associated Press writers Lolita C.

(WIVB) - - The Erie County Executive is teaming up with leaders across the border to fight the potential for a trade war with Canada.Mark Polancarz says the tariffs will have a negative impact on the economy on both sides of the border.He says the tax will drive up the costs for both manufacturers and consumers as well as threaten job growth.Teaming up with the President of the Hamilton Chamber of Commmerce and the Buffalo-Niagara Partnership, these leaders say almost 500 thousand American jobs are at risk.In May, President Trump imposed a tax on steel and aluminum from Canada, Mexico and the E.U.This move comes as the U.S. tries to renegotiate NAFTA with both Canada and Mexico.Now they want to send a message to Washington and to Ottawa: stop the trade war before it starts:Leaders say it's not only the steel and aluminum industries either. Poloncarz spoke about how much both economies are integrated:He said, 'Food based products. General mills. We sell lots of cereal, and those types of products are included on the tariff list as well. It's not just tubes and pipes and steel. People need to understand that everything from chocolate, to maple syrup, to soy sauce, to ketchup to mustard. Just slapping tariffs is not going to solve the issue. It's only going to create a much greater problem that is going to have to be alleviate in the long run.'There's almost no overlap between New York's 25 largest exports and the products set to be hit by tariffs.Only one, as we mentioned, aluminum plates, shows up on the list of Canada's proposed tariffs.The E.U. retaliation would actually hit New York the hardest.Four of the top 25 products appear on the 10-page list.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By Jethro MullenWASHINGTON â€” The United States and China are acting tough over trade, but theyâ€™re also busy talking to try to stop the situation spiraling out of control.President Donald Trump ramped up tensions last week by ordering tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese goods just weeks after announcing of sanctions on steel and aluminum imports. Beijing has responded with plans to target $3 billion worth of US products and warnings that itâ€™s ready to inflict more pain.The moves have fueled fears that the situation could escalate into a full-blown trade war between the worldâ€™s two largest economies. But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that heâ€™s been talking to Chinese officials in an effort to prevent that.â€œWeâ€™re not afraid of a trade war, but thatâ€™s not our objective,â€? he said in an interview on Fox News.â€œWe are going to proceed with our tariffs â€¦ weâ€™re also working on investment restrictions,â€? Mnuchin said. â€œBut we are simultaneously having negotiations with the Chinese to see if we can reach an agreement.â€?The US government wants China to do a lot more to open up its vast economy to US businesses and bring down the massive trade deficit between the two countries.Trump has set a target of cutting the deficit in goods with China by $100 billion. It soared to $375 billion last year, according to US figures.Mnuchin said the United States wants China to do away with rules that require foreign companies to set up joint ventures with Chinese firms in many industries, such as automobiles, and to stop forcing American businesses to hand over valuable intellectual property in order to operate in China. Intellectual property theft is the reason the Trump administration gave for the planned $50 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods.Mnuchin and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer detailed the US requests in a letter to a top Chinese economic official late last week, according to the Wall Street Journal. They included asking Beijing to reduce tariffs on American cars, increase spending on US semiconductors and provide greater access to the Chinese financial sector, the Journal reported, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.A Treasury Department spokesperson declined to confirm the report.â€œWe are having very productive conversations with them,â€? Mnuchin told Fox, adding that he was â€œcautiously hopefulâ€? that the two sides could reach a deal. But in the absence of â€œan acceptable agreement that the president signs off on,â€? the Trump administration will press ahead with the tariffs and other measures, he warned.Chinaâ€™s point man for the talks is Liu He, a Harvard graduate who is one of President Xi Jinpingâ€™s most trusted advisers. Liu was in Washington for talks with US officials the week that Trump announced plans for the tariffs on steel and aluminum and was recently appointed to the position of vice premier.Mnuchin and Liu spoke as recently as this weekend.â€œSecretary Mnuchin called Liu He to congratulate him on the official announcement of his new role,â€? the Treasury spokesperson said. â€œThey also discussed the trade deficit between our two countries and committed to continuing the dialogue to find a mutually agreeable way to reduce it.â€?Chinaâ€™s official news agency Xinhua also reported the conversation, saying that Liu criticized the US allegations of Chinese intellectual property theft and warned Mnuchin that China â€œhas the capability to safeguard its national interest.â€?But Liu also said that China â€œhopes to see both sides remain sensible and work together to preserve the overall stability of China-US trade relations,â€? according to the Xinhua report.Some experts are skeptical that Beijing will give Trump what he wants.â€œChina may be able to come up with some big ticket imports to allow it to appear to be trying to reduce the bilateral trade imbalance,â€? Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at research firm Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. â€œBut China wonâ€™t be able to reduce the annual imbalance by $100bn as Mr Trump has demanded.â€?And â€œthe chances of China making substantive changes to its practices on intellectual property are also low,â€? Williams said, adding that the practices are seen in Beijing as â€œa key elementâ€? of efforts to develop the Chinese economy.â€” CNNâ€™s Donna Borak and Steven Jiang contributed to this report.The-CNN-Wire â„¢ & Â© 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

"For the past few weeks, all the presidentâ€™s talk about trade wars has been an abstract notion for most of us â€“ a concern for policymakers in Washington but nothing that would come home to disrupt our daily lives.But when China announced Monday that itâ€™s slapping a 25 percent tariff on pork products in retaliation to President Donald Trumpâ€™s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the global became local. It may be just a little sting, but weâ€™re worried about what will happen if this is only the first round of a trade war soon to escalate.North Carolina is the second-biggest pork-producing state in the country and most of the producers are in eastern North Carolina. According to pork industry statistics, Sampson and Duplin counties are the top two pork-producing counties in the country. Between them they raise more than a third of the more than 9 million hogs produced annually in this state. Thatâ€™s a lot of spare ribs.And in the case of China exports, thatâ€™s a lot of pigsâ€™ feet, ears and stomachs, the primary products that China buys from American pork producers. According to a report this week by WUNC, North Carolina exported about $100 million in pork products to China last year. Itâ€™s unclear whether the new tariffs would kill that business. Equally puzzling is why China first targeted pork, since the Chinese company WH Group owns Smithfield Foods, this countryâ€™s largest pork producer, which also operates the worldâ€™s largest pork processing facility, just down N.C. 87 in Bladen County.But then, China raises most of its own pork supply, importing only 3 percent of its pork products from the U.S. The biggest American pork importers are Canada and Mexico, a fact that should touch off big what-if concerns if the president makes good on his threats to blow up the North American Free Trade Agreement.But thatâ€™s only the beginning of our worries. Trump and China are both making noises about escalating a trade war, and China is signaling that agricultural imports will be the earliest targets for new tariffs. Corn and soybeans â€“ big business for North Carolina farmers â€“ have already been mentioned.The agricultural focus of Chinaâ€™s first wave of retaliatory tariffs makes it clear that the country is aiming a spear at the rural, agricultural parts of this country where the president has had the greatest support. If business is hurt and this causes Trumpâ€™s popularity to decline, there surely will be smiles in Beijing.But if the trade war escalates, this state can be hurt in many more ways. North Carolinaâ€™s economy did $32.6 billion in export business last year and China was our third-biggest trading partner â€“ trailing only Canada and Mexico. Overall trade with China last year brought $2.3 billion into this stateâ€™s economy. Chemicals are by far this stateâ€™s biggest export product, followed by transportation equipment, machinery, computer and electronic products and textiles and fabrics (yes, weâ€™re still in that business, to the tune of $1.9 billion in exports last year). Again, weâ€™re worried more about the fall of NAFTA here than a tariff battle with China, however painful that might be.Given the delicate balance of a global economy, we doubt the presidentâ€™s assurances that a trade war is easy to win, with few consequences for the American economy. But given the huge trade imbalance between the U.S. and China â€“ we import from China vastly more than we export to it â€“ itâ€™s likely survivable.But weâ€™re much more worried about the presidentâ€™s threats to tear up other trade agreements, especially NAFTA, which has turned the U.S., Canada and Mexico into what in many ways is a unified economy â€“ much to the benefit of all three countries.The Fayetteville Observer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THOMPSONVILLE -- The possibility of a trade war between the United States and other countries concerns Southern Illinois farmers.'Well, my first thought is it scares me to death,' said Larry Miller, a Thompsonville farmer.Increased competition from Argentina and Brazil, rising expenses and lower commodity prices have already made their jobs harder in recent years.'There's a lot of challenges out here in agriculture right now and so you really don't want to see anything else to cause you to stay awake at night,' said Miller.More sleepless nights could be in his future, if the U.S. winds up in a trade war.President Donald Trump wants to slap a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum.The president says it's about putting America first.'You know, when we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad,' said Trump. 'When we're down by $30 billion, $40 billion, $60 billion, $100 billion, the trade war hurts them doesn't hurt us. So we'll see what happens. We're going to straighten that out and we'll do it in a very loving way. In a loving, loving way. They'll like us better and they will respect us much more.'Larry McClerren with the Franklin County Farm Bureau says if other countries retaliate against the U.S., as they've promised to do, it would make it more difficult -- and expensive -- for American farmers to get their crops into vitally important markets.'Most everything that's grown in this area probably leaves this country,' said McClerren. 'We do not need a trade war.'McClerren and Miller said Trump appears to be fulfilling a campaign promise.'He said he was going to look at what he believed to be unfair trade relationships with foreign countries and he's definitely doing that I guess,' said McClerren.McClerren said he wants the president to know that decisions he makes makes impacts all Americans, and to consider that before taking action.On Wednesday, the White House announced Mexico, Canada and other countries may be exempted from the tariffs under national security 'carve-outs.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Wyoming lawmakers are sticking by President Trump as he escalates his global trade war even as fear is growing that it will soon be felt from the state's oil fields all the way down to the electronics you rely on.Wyoming oil and gas companies are already facing a labor shortage, but now those companies may soon get hit with another sucker punch: the increased cost of buy buying the steel they rely on every day. Steel is used from everything to the pipes used to drill wells to the pipes used to carry that black gold and even natural gas to market. As those costs of doing business go up, it will either mean fewer jobs, or you'll be paying more money at the pump. Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney admitted she's hearing about it but she's being patient for now.'We've got to wait and see. It's the one area - I just met with some chamber of commerce folks this morning - and the economy is going great and everybody is very pleased about that, but the one area where you do begin to hear a little bit of nervousness is trade.'Like Wyoming's senators, Cheney said she's a proud free trader. Still, she's giving the president room to negotiate - and she believes most of the people's she's talked to back home are too.'So far, people have - the perspective has been, we understand that this is an effort to get better trade deals to help improve the situation.' They're giving the president support still in terms of let's let him run the negotiations out here.'Wyoming Senator John Barrasso serves on the Foreign Relations Committee. A couple months ago they held a hearing on the potential impact of the tariff - or trade war - and he voiced his concerns about the potential impact of what many experts now say has become a full-blown, tit for tat trade.'You know, I'm concerned just as everyone is at the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs on businesses and consumers.'Back in July Barrasso and Wyoming senior Senator Mike Enzi were two of just eleven GOP senators to oppose a bill meant to signal to Trump that the Senate is watching his trade war and that they'll intervene if it escalates. Pennsylvania Republican Senator Pat Toomey - a staunch conservative and reliable Trump ally - sponsored the bill. He says it was important because it states that the president can't use the national security designation, known as section 232, to levy tariffs without the approval of Congress.'To put senators on record either supporting or opposing the idea, then Congress should have some say in invoking section 232 tariffs. This would be new and it's very important, I think, as a first step to doing something.'While Barrasso is worried about the impact steel tariffs may have on Wyoming's oil and gas industry, he's been pushing the administration to use that 232 authority to launch an investigation into uranium imports, which he argues are hurting Wyoming's large uranium industry.'Because what we've been seeing for years is that uranium producers owned by the government in Russia, in Kazakhstan and in Uzbekistan, they've unfairly flooded our American markets with cheap uranium to the point that today American producers fulfill less than 5% of our US demand for uranium.'But a growing number of Republicans are getting restless with the trade war and want it wound down, not ratcheted up. Virginia Republican Rob Wittman has a large farming, seafood and manufacturing base in his district. He says patience is starting to wear thin in his district.'Listen, I understand the president wanting to have greater leverage in negotiating with China, but he's got to understand the long-term impact it will have back here, so that means they've got to get something done. The longer it goes on the bigger impact it has.'But Congresswoman Cheney said, at least for now, Wyoming's agriculture community has been largely shielded from the brunt of the trade war. So for now, she's getting briefed by the Trump administration and remaining optimistic that Trump's hard nose tactic will end up working.'I understand what he's doing, but I share the concern of my constituents, that we want to make sure that we don't end up having more pain, and frankly, slowing down the economy. We've had tremendous economic recovery and we want to make sure we keep that going.'Still, Cheney added that Wyoming business owners do have a breaking point.'They're not to the point yet where folks are saying they don't like the policy, but they're sort of raising some cautionary notes about 'this is an area where we're a little nervous.''Nervousness in the business community often means holding off on investments, which has most every Republican worried that the trade war will be felt by their voters soon. And they're hoping they don't feel it ahead of November's elections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The first official gauge of Chinaâ€™s economy in October showed manufacturing activity continued to worsen, as the effects of an ongoing trade war with the U.S. hit home. The first official gauge of Chinaâ€™s economy in October showed manufacturing activity continued to worsen, as the effects of an ongoing trade war with the U.S. hit home.The manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 50.2 this month, lower than projected in a Bloomberg survey of forecasters. A gauge of new orders for export, which gives an indication of demand, fell further into contraction territory, dropping to the lowest reading since early 2016.A level of 50 marks the dividing line between expansion and contraction. Most sub-indexes in the data declined from September, indicating that the slowdown was widespread.Chinaâ€™s government is trying to balance competing forces, attempting to support growth while also continuing the policy of slowing debt expansion which has made credit to companies more scarce. Domestic economic growth is slowing, sentiment has followed the stock market down, and while exports are still strong now, they are expected to slow as higher U.S. tariffs kick in.â€œTodayâ€™s PMI confirms that Chinaâ€™s economy is under strain and this is despite policy easing, export front-loading, a still-strong housing market and a relaxation of the anti-pollution campaign,â€? said Rob Subbaraman, head of emerging markets economics at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Singapore. â€œWe believe the worst is yet to come. Payback from export front-loading, continued deleveraging and a property market correction will lead to a sharper deceleration in the economy in the first quarter next year.â€?Government SupportThe government and central bank this month introduced a raft of measuresto stabilize sentiment, adding to steps to boost liquidity in the financial system, tax deductions for households and targeted measures aimed at helping exporters. Those measures have yet to have much effect, and in particular the export orders gauge signals that the economy will see more downward pressure in the months to come.Japanese and Korea industrial output in September both fell more than expected, with a series of natural disasters in Japan cutting production and the autumn holidays in Korea reducing the number of days factories were open.Chinaâ€™s non-manufacturing PMI, which reflects activity in the construction and services sectors, also worsened to 53.9 from Septemberâ€™s 54.9 reading. The service-sector component dropped 1.3 points to 52.1, the lowest level since mid-2016, while the construction component rose to 63.9, matching the December 2017 record high.Officials Talk Up MarketTop officials including President Xi Jinping have also sought to bolster investor confidence, commenting on the fundamental strength of the economy and attempting to talk up the stock market, which has fallen 9 percent this month.A set of early indicators compiled by Bloomberg Economics prior to the official PMI report suggested that sentiment among executives and investors continued to deteriorate in October.â€œChina-U.S. trade tensions have impacted some industries,â€? said Wen Tao, an analyst with China Logistics Information Center, which releases the PMI data. â€œLooking ahead, with the environment cleanup campaign in winter set to kick in, and no positive shift in China U.S. trade frictions, domestic demand will be relatively stable in November, but external demand will continue to decline,â€? Wen said in a statement on the organizationâ€™s website.On Tuesday, Chinaâ€™s currency slid to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar in more than a decade following a report that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to expand tariffs to cover the full range of imports from China if he is unable to extract concessions from Xi during a Group of 20 summit of world leaders in Argentina at the end of November.The yuan traded onshore at 6.9659 per dollar at 10:56 a.m. in Shanghai.

"The Trump Administration's tariffs on Chinese goods are now in effect, and China is firing back.China calling this the largest trade war in economic history, saying they were forced to respond with their own tariffs.China's target list of American goods includes electric cars, whiskey, poultry and soybeans.For the U.S., Friday's tariffs on $34 billion dollars worth of Chinese exports are affecting more than 800 Chinese products.This includes machinery, medical devices and auto parts.Local businesses and consumers are now preparing for rising prices.As China puts tariffs on U.S. goods effective immediately, businesses say it's a game of wait and see.â€œThe goal is to develop more American jobs by buying less from overseas and having it produced domestically. Thatâ€™s a lot easier said than done,â€? said George Conboy, Chairman of Brighton Securities.Conboy says a trade war and tariffs is rarely good for consumers, and if it lasts more than a few months, it will hurt both the U.S. and China.â€œWeâ€™re gonna find out whether China needs us more than we need them. Itâ€™s a game of chicken right now,â€? Conboy explained.Washing machine prices are already going up, some brands by $50. Car dealerships say tariffs could affect what vehicle you buy.â€œItâ€™s really hard to say what this is going to look like,â€? said Brad McAreavy, President of Rochester Auto Dealers Association. â€œIt could apply to parts, it could apply to a vehicle in its entirety.

Some are going to be winning, and some consumers are going to pay a little more. Itâ€™s too early.â€?Trump and his advisers argue the tariffs are necessary to pressure China into abandoning unfair practices.But Senator Charles Schumer says the president should have focused on China aloneâ€œGo after China, but don't treat China the same as Canada, who we have a lot of good relationships with and we need to be far more careful. Don't treat them the same as Europe,' he said.Conboy says, watch and wait. â€œNationwide, China needs us more than we need them. So in the end the tactic might actually work,' he said.While it's unclear how long these tariffs will last, there is the possibility of more tariffs at the end of the summer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"FILE PHOTO: Snow covered transfer lines are seen at the Dominion Cove Point Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal in Lusby, Maryland March 18, 2014. Gary Cameron/File Photo via VCGAs China closes in on becoming the top liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer in the world and the U.S. ramps up its LNG exports, a marriage seemingly made in energy heaven is still at risk of getting annulled.LNG nearly became one of the biggest casualties in an increasingly acrimonious trade war.Beijing put U.S. LNG imports on its list of products subject to tariffs, only to reconsider the move. China has the problem of responding to a major likely increase in American fees with less effective options in response.I have been a vocal critic of U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s tariffs. They are simply bad policy. Better ways exist for handling trade disagreements. Even disregarding the contribution to geopolitical tension levels, they will cost more jobs and economic growth in the downstream American market than they are worth.Thatâ€™s even before the price tag of subsidizing U.S. farmers and others hurt are figured into the equation.Trump unveiled the latest $16 billion of Chinese goods subject to 25% tariffs earlier this month, while threatening to up the ante to $200 billion. China responded in kind, initially putting LNG on the list (along with an extension of levies against imports of U.S. oil products). U.S. crude oil was already subject to tariffs, part of the response to the initial Trump tariff move announced in March.The problem from the Chinese policy standpoint is now two-fold. First, the U.S. imports about four times as much from China as it exports there. That means Washington has far more leverage in selecting tariff targets. Chinese economic considerations, on the other hand, mean Beijing has more limited options in the tit-for-tat trade spat.Second, applying tariffs to LNG will almost certainly price U.S. exports out of the Chinese market and deal a blow to the American export prospects. Until coming to a screeching halt in August, China had imported at least 17% more U.S. LNG in the first seven months of 2018 than it had for all of 2017. About 15% of all U.S. LNG had been going to China with the market prospects for significantly higher volumes in the offing.But it also occasions a significant problem for China in developing a ready source of gas in its pursuit of an energy policy less dependent on coal.Thatâ€™s the basic reason why U.S. LNG appeared on Chinaâ€™s tariff list only to be withdrawn a few days later. As demand for natural gas grows, China has been evenly dividing imports between LNG and piped gas.But throughput volume on the main Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline (CAGP) â€“ the primary transit route for gas from Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan â€“ is now at more than 93% of capacity.That means plans had called for an even greater increase in LNG imports. Yet pricing is an increasing problem. The recent Asian heat wave spiked what should have been off-peak prices in Japan and South Korea, the other of the top three LNG global importers. That wave hit the Chinese market.As the peak price for both contracted and spot market, prices annually hit in October, the attempt by Beijing to engineer flexible demand policies will become more difficult if U.S. LNG consignments are priced out of the domestic market.Having to rely upon the spot market for winter deliveries is very expensive. S&P Platts estimated that last winter China had to pay as much as $11.70 (80.40 yuan) per million BTUs. Put in perspective, that is more than 400% higher than Henry Hub prices (the benchmark for U.S. gas futures contracts) at close of trade on August 28.Such a spread certainly explains why U.S. LNG exporters had eyed the Asian market generally, and China in particular, with so much anticipation. Meanwhile, Australia, where additional capacity is available at the four online northwestern projects, Papua New Guinea (offset by American company involvement there), Qatar (the worldâ€™s leading LNG exporter), and even Russia are already jockeying to pick up the available volume needed in the Chinese market.For Beijing, the pricing balance between pipelines and LNG will become more difficult to maintain, while increasing uncertainty on export prospects will dampen U.S. prospects. Both sides are likely to experience some adverse impact on economic growth as this geopolitical game of chicken intensifies.Unfortunately, neither side shows any indication of crying â€œUncle.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"HONG KONG (Nikkei Markets) -- Hong Kong shares headed for their fourth decline in five trading days on Wednesday as investors took little comfort from U.S. President Donald Trump's signal that he may not impose new restrictions on Chinese investments.The Hang Seng Index slipped 0.6% to 28,713.80. China Construction Bank (CCB) shed 1.1%, Ping An Insurance Group gave up 2% and Tencent Holdings lost 0.8%. Energy producers provided a counterweight, with CNOOC gaining 4.5% and China Petroleum & Chemical (Sinopec) adding 1%. Nymex crude oil futures climbed back above $70 a barrel overnight following reports that the U.S. was seeking to halt imports of Iranian crude by Japan and other allies.President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that the U.S. would rely on existing tools rather than new restrictions to control Chinese investments in U.S. technologies. Uncertainty over trade relations between the world's two largest economies has dragged down global equities in the past several weeks, pushing the Shanghai Composite Index into a technical bear market on Tuesday as it fell to 20% below its January high.'Trump's reversal on imposing limits on Chinese-linked investments is unexpected, yet offers little reassurance to the Hong Kong stock market, as investors can only put 50% trust in his words,' said Kenny Wen, a wealth management strategist at Everbright Sun Hung Kai in Hong Kong.

"Tom Adams, founder and CEO of Maine Coast, a lobster distributor in the U.S. East Coast state, will never forget the moment China authorized tariffs on his product on June 16. (Photo by Mariko Hirano)SHANGHAI -- More than a week has passed since the U.S. and China fired the opening shots in what is turning out to be an escalating trade war that has yet to produce any visible winners in either of the world's two biggest markets.When President Donald Trump's White House initiated 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods on July 6, China immediately retaliated with a 25% duty on $34 billion of U.S. imports.Among the items targeted by Beijing are Tesla Motor's electric autos, which are prized items on the mainland. Two days after the tariffs were implemented, a crowd of customers worried about larger sticker prices stormed a Tesla dealership in central Shanghai.'Once the present inventory is depleted, we will immediately raise the price,' said a sales manager. The popular Model S is due to sell by the end of this month, at which point the price will go up about 140,000 yuan ($20,900). 'If you don't reserve one now, you will lose out,' said the dealer.Because CEO Elon Musk has yet to build his planned assembly plant in Shanghai, all Tesla vehicles are American imports. Last year, the automaker sold about 15,000 units in China, but the tariffs will likely dent that performance. One person at the Shanghai dealership was worried that the business will hardly sell any vehicles imported past July 6.A Tesla showroom in Shanghai. The tariff war has taken a direct hit on prices. (Photo by Yu Nakamura)On top of that, the trade war will be asymmetrical. While the U.S. imported roughly $500 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2017, China only took in about $130 billion. Even one round of tit-for-tat tariffs will paralyze exports in both directions. The first casualty of that phenomenon is the interruption of U.S. exports to China.Tom Adams, founder and CEO of Maine Coast, a lobster distributor in the U.S. East Coast state, will never forget the moment when China authorized tariffs on the seafood on June 16. 'I was at home, and it was a blow in the first day,' he saidThanks to China's burgeoning middle class, Maine Coast enjoyed Chinese demand that rose between 20% and 30% annually. The company had just finished a $1.5 million plant expansion when the good times came to an abrupt halt.'July 1 was when [Chinese] customers started holding off buying from us. Completely ceased,' said Adams. The company has set lofty sales projections and 'a big part of that growth expectation is China,' he added.Another victim of the trade war is the American soybean farmer. China imported roughly 96 million tons of soybeans last year, making it the largest importer of the commodity. China only produces about 15 million tons of soybeans domestically, illustrating its dependence on imports.The U.S. is China's second-biggest source of soybeans at 34% of the imports, after Brazil, which ships 53%. The staple is used to make cooking oil and seasoning, and soybean meal is found in pig feed.Iowa soybean farmer Tim Bardole is now worried about next year's crop. (Photo by Yoko Noge Dean)Now the tariffs have taken the bottom out of U.S. soybean prices, delivering a gut punch to farmers like Tim Bardole. He was already $100,000 in the red last year due to a yearslong slump in cereal prices, and the current predicament has driven him into a corner.'I'm not sure if I can get a loan from the bank to finance our next year's crop,' said Bardole.In China, there are signs that the country is having a difficult time filling the hole left by the U.S. The local government serving the northeast city of Changchun issued a notice in late April announcing lavish subsidies for farmers who grow more soybeans.But a visit to a village outside of Changchun last month revealed sprawling fields of corn and hardly any soybean to be seen. 'We already planted corn when the notice came, so there was no time' to switch to soybeans, said a farmer.China could expand soybean imports from Brazil or Russia, but even those options would not be enough. At the end of the day, the Chinese will have to meet demand with U.S. soybeans with the tariffs in place, and pass the extra costs to consumers.The price hikes will hurt ordinary citizens -- something the one-party state seems to recognize. A state media outlet went as far as to say Chinese will 'gladly' accept a temporary setback, which sparked online 'flaming' of government officials on China's highly regulated internet.A farm in Changchun, of China's Jilin Province. The government instructed farmers to grow soybeans, but most had already planted corn. (Photo by Issaku Harada)The trade war has grim implications for Chinese employees as well, since the country sits in the middle of the global supply chain. Components and intermediates from Japan, South Korea and elsewhere are pieced together at the 'world's factory,' which ships out end products to America.The Trump administration provided a sneak preview of what could come when it imposed emergency tariffs on solar panel imports in January. The impact rippled through China's coastal Jiangsu Province, suspending operations or lowering capacity utilization at a number of solar-power companies concentrated there.Experts say 2.5 million workers were negatively affected. GCL group employees staged a large protest at a factory July 2 demanding jobs and protection of workers' interest.In Zhongshan, a city in the south, a mid-tier industrial machinery manufacturer was pressed by U.S. clients to ship all the inventory on hand before the tariffs kicked off on June 6. 'I wonder what we'll do from here on out,' said an executive.After being slapped with a U.S. import ban in April, ZTE was left unable to produce smartphones and telecommunications equipment, which nearly drove it out of business. Other manufacturers on both sides of the Pacific are bracing for similar cutoffs to the supply chain.Of course, U.S. consumers will not be immune. The White House announced Tuesday it is preparing a 10% levy on $200 billion worth of additional Chinese goods, which could go into force in September. Included on the blacklist are daily consumables, and a jump in prices could depress U.S. consumption.According to a study published in May that was commissioned by the Consumer Technology Association and the National Retail Federation, a then-proposed tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports would cost 134,000 Americans jobs. 'Protection is not good for anybody,' said Wayne Fredericks, a soybean farmer in Iowa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"TOKYO -- The U.S. and China seemed like a good match, at least in terms of liquefied natural gas supply and demand. Beijing was determined to clean up its smoggy air by shifting away from coal, and America had LNG to sell.Then the trade war broke out.The tariff battle has touched off a domino effect in the energy industry, with major geopolitical implications far beyond the world's two biggest economies.China became the second-largest importer of LNG last year, after Japan, and in doing so shipped in 500% more of the fuel from the U.S. The volume exceeded 100 billion cu. feet, accounting for under 10% of China's total purchases, and the ratio was expected to rise further.After U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a third round of tariffs against China on Sept. 24, however, the Chinese side hit back the same day with levies on $60 billion worth of American goods. The retaliation included a 10% tariff on LNG.This has sparked nervousness on the street. 'I'll be in trouble if the price of natural gas goes up due to the trade war,' said a taxi driver in the Chinese city of Chongqing. Roughly 100,000 taxis and other vehicles in the city run on natural gas.But Beijing does have options. It is deepening ties with a pair of countries also at odds with the White House -- Russia and Iran. Meanwhile, faced with the prospect of losing its lucrative foothold in China, the U.S. is pushing hard to sell more gas to Europe and Japan.The new reality crystallized in September, at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. Russian President Vladimir Putin described Chinese President Xi Jinping, who was attending the event for the first time, as the most important guest. In a show of camaraderie, the two leaders dined on Russian crepes together.Their talks reportedly covered expanded cooperation in energy, including natural gas.Also at the forum, state-owned China National Petroleum Corp. and Russian gas producer Novatek discussed LNG projects in the Arctic Ocean. A number of such endeavors are underway in the frigid region, and funds from China are crucial.Yet another key project is the Power of Siberia pipeline for transporting gas from a field in eastern Siberia to China. Construction was delayed from the original plan, as China was counting on LNG from the U.S., but the momentum appears to be picking up again.'We must complete negotiations on additional supplies before the end of this year and, before Dec. 20 next year, launch deliveries through the Power of Siberia pipeline,' Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak said on Sept. 17.Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian host, President Vladimir Putin, show camaraderie over crepes on the sidelines of the 2018 Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok in September. (Getty Images)As for Iran -- like Russia, a target of U.S. economic sanctions -- CNPC has taken over French oil giant Total's rights to part of the development of the South Pars field in the Persian Gulf, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported in August.The field is one of the world's largest, and Iran ranks No. 1 globally in proven natural gas reserves. This does not mean the gas can be exported immediately, but the arrangement should help China prepare for a future demand surge.Beijing's next move could be to procure gas produced in Iran and Turkmenistan through a pipeline.China is reportedly thinking about joining a pipeline project involving Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, known as TAPI. In August, Pakistani media quoted Mobin Saulat, the chief executive of Pakistan's Inter State Gas Systems, as saying that China has expressed interest in TAPI as a complement to the Belt and Road Initiative.For other gas producers, China is simply too large to ignore. In the coming years, the country looks destined to become the world's biggest market.Qatar's state-owned LNG producer, Qatargas, announced on Sept. 10 that it had sealed a contract to provide PetroChina with 3.4 million tons of LNG annually for 22 years. At the end of that month, state oil company Qatar Petroleum unveiled a plan to raise its LNG production capacity to 110 million tons a year, from 77 million tons.Australia and Canada are also eyeing opportunities in the Chinese market.None of this bodes well for the U.S. energy industry. The trade war could undermine American competitiveness and boost projects in places like Canada, Russia and Qatar, according to Samuel Phillips of Barclays. Production and export of LNG requires massive capital investment in lengthy construction projects, and the tit-for-tat tariffs mean China is less likely to invest in U.S. developments.Pessimism was running high at a conference hosted by the United States Association for Energy Economics, a nonprofit organization, in Virginia at the end of September. Many participants questioned the prospects for LNG initiatives in the U.S.'For the long-term market, the consequences are likely to be felt on new supply developments,' said Giles Farrer, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy research and consulting company. The trade war 'restricts the target market for developers of new U.S. LNG projects trying to sign new long-term contracts.'Large LNG projects, worth around $60 billion, have been planned in Texas and other parts of the U.S. in anticipation of increased demand from China. Their fate is unclear.The irony is that Trump sees energy exports as an effective tool to reduce America's trade deficits with other countries.The shale gas revolution transformed the U.S. into a natural gas exporter. And last year, China was the No. 3 buyer of U.S. LNG after Mexico and South Korea, taking in 15% of the total exports.As China looks elsewhere, Trump is desperate to fill the void quickly, partly to protect American energy jobs. This is where Europe and Japan come in: They appear to be making concessions on LNG to keep Trump's anger over trade imbalances at bay.'If you look at the miners in coal, if you look at energy, LNG -- Japan just gave us some numbers that are incredible,' Trump said after a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in New York on Sept. 26. 'They're doubling the amount that they are going to be buying for Japan.'Boasting of his deal-making prowess, the president added: 'I said, 'You have to do me a favor. We don't want these big deficits. You're going to have to buy more.''Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corp. in September entered into discussions on procuring more LNG from Texas. A company operating a processing facility in the state plans to turn out about 2 million tons of LNG per year for Sumitomo, over a 20-year period starting in 2023. The plan is to use a new plant currently under construction.The shale gas revolution turned the U.S. into a natural gas exporter, but the trade war is seen as a threat to the industry's competitiveness. Â© ReutersEarlier, in July, Trump met with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and agreed to start negotiations on boosting exports of U.S. LNG to the European Union. Then, in September, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier announced that the site for a new LNG import terminal would be decided by the end of the year as 'a gesture to our American friends.'The upshot? As more countries gain ground as gas suppliers and emerging economies become bigger consumers, the energy market of tomorrow may look nothing like it did yesterday.'The impact on the value might be limited for now,' said Dave Ernsberger of S&P Global Platts. 'But there is the potential to completely re-engineer the flow of the world because of this trade war.'U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry met his Russian counterpart, Alexander Novak, last month and told him that while competition is welcome, Moscow can no longer use energy as a weapon because the U.S. is now positioned as an alternative supplier to Europe and Asia.But energy is never far removed from geopolitics. According to Reuters and other media, China completely stopped importing crude oil from the U.S. in September. And as the trade war rages, natural gas, too, is becoming a more prominent form of diplomatic ammunition.Shunsuke Tabeta in Beijing contributed to this article.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports officially came into effect last Friday and China responded with tariffs of the same value on US goods, The Straits Times reported.While experts have said that the initial tariffs are unlikely to do significant damage, a full-blown, prolonged trade war could harm both countries â€“ and the global economy.Here is how a trade war could impact four countries across Southeast Asia, and how some of them are gearing up to combat the threat.SingaporeSingapore has been identified as one of the Asean members likely to suffer the most from a trade war. OCBC economists have warned that an all-out trade war between the worldâ€™s two largest economies could reduce the city stateâ€™s GDP by 0.3 percentage points this year, The Straits Times reported. As an export-heavy nation, Singapore is especially vulnerable to the effects of a trade war, which will be felt most in export-dependent sectors like transportation and storage, wholesale and retail, Channel News Asia reported, quoting Oxford Economicsâ€™ lead Asia economist Sian Fenner.DBS chief economist Taimur Bag also pointed out that trade openness and exposure to the electronics supply chain means that there will be no respite for Singapore or neighbouring Malaysia.MalaysiaLocated just across the border from Singapore, Malaysia is another Asean nation that is expected to suffer in the event of a major trade war. China is Malaysiaâ€™s biggest trading partner, and the economy, once heavily dependent on exports of crude and palm oil now derives more than $341 billion from its sale of electronics and machinery and its parts to China, according to Forbes.ThailandThailand stands to be hit directly as well as indirectly, having been slapped with tariffs on washing machines, solar cells, steel and aluminium products, The Nation reported.Tisco Economic Strategy Unit (ESU) has analysed the potential impact of both the direct tariff as well as the effect of the US-China battle and has concluded that the impact is quite limited, as the four products subjected to the US tariffs only made up $885 million or 0.37 per cent of Thailandâ€™s exports last year.They are also optimistic that the indirect effect of the trade war will be mild. The list of goods hit by the first $50 billion will affect the countryâ€™s exports of machinery, plastics, vehicles and parts â€“ products Thailand exported for a total of 8.8 billion last year. An estimate of the amount of products re-exported by China to the US suggests that only $590 million or 0.25 per cent of Thailandâ€™s total exports will be affected.IndonesiaThe US is a key market for Indonesian exports, with knitted apparel, woven apparel, rubber, electrical machinery, footwear, fish and seafood being the countryâ€™s seven top exports to the US, The Jakarta Post said in an editorial. A trade war would hurt the countryâ€™s exports both directly and indirectly.The Indonesian government plans to introduce measures to minimize the potential risks posed by a trade war, including strengthening local industries, curbing raw material import demands by developing basic industries, and boosting tourism by encouraging budget airlines to expand and renovate airports across the archipelago, The Straits Times reported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China, fueling an already heated trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies.Trump said in a statement the further tariffs were being considered 'in light of China's unfair retaliation' against earlier U.S. trade actions that included $50 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods.He added that the U.S. Trade Representative had determined that China 'has repeatedly engaged in practices to unfairly obtain Americaâ€™s intellectual property.'U.S. stock index futures fell in reaction to Trump's latest statement. Financial markets have swung wildly over the past few days in response to fears of escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.'Rather than remedy its misconduct, China has chosen to harm our farmers and manufacturers,' Trump said.The tariffs are aimed at forcing changes to Chinese government policies aimed at transferring U.S. intellectual property to Chinese companies.The USTR's 'Section 301' investigation authorizing the tariffs alleges China has systematically sought to misappropriate U.S. intellectual property through joint venture requirements that often cannot be negotiated without technology transfers, something China denies.The tariffs have stirred fears that the two countries will spiral into a trade war that will crush global growth.The Trump administration this week proposed 25 percent tariffs on some 1,300 Chinese industrial and other products. China shot back with a list of similar duties on American imports including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals.The retaliatory tariffs have left Republican lawmakers from Western and Midwestern states fearful of a big hit to U.S. farming exporters.(Reporting by Eric Beech and Caren Bohan in Washington; Editing by Peter Cooney)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Fears of an escalating trade war hit the share prices of Asian steelmakers and manufacturers supplying US markets particularly hard on Friday following a rough night on Wall Street.Trump said the duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium would be formally announced next week, although White House officials later said some details still needed to be ironed out.'The imposition of a tariff like this will do nothing other than distort trade and ultimately, we believe, will lead to a loss of jobs,' Australian trade minister Steven Ciobo told reporters in Sydney.'My concern remains that on the back of actions like this we could see retaliatory measures that are put in place by other major economies.

ReutersAustralia, which has championed the free-trade Trans Pacific Partnership that Trump pulled the United States out of, has sought an exemption for its steel and aluminium to the United States, Ciobo added.Steel has become key focus for Trump, who pledged to restore the US industry and punish what he sees as unfair trade practices, particularly by China.Although China only accounts for 2 percent of US steel imports, its massive industry expansion has helped produce a global glut of steel that has driven down prices.'The impact on China is not big,â€? said Li Xinchuang, vice secretary-general of the China Iron and Steel Association.

'I donâ€™t think exports of steel and aluminium from Japan, which is a US ally, damages US national security in any way, and we would like to explain that to the US.'A worker takes a sample of molten alumnium in a shop of Kazakh mining company Eurasian Resources Group's (ERG) Kazakhstan Aluminium Smelter JSC (KAS) factory in Pavlodar, Kazakhstan Feb 20, 2018.

"With US declaring war on trade deficits, international trade has come under a cloud. The resulting uncertainty is forcing countries to re-evaluate their strategic options and hedge their bets. Carlos Gutierrez, former US secretary of commerce and co-chair of the Albright Stonebridge Group, spoke with Rudroneel Ghosh about the fate of global trade and changing international equations:Given the US administrationâ€™s war on trade deficits, whatâ€™s the future of global trade?We are headed into a period of time when things will be very messy. In the short term, global trade has unfortunately taken a step back. I say short term because it will become obvious very soon that restricting trade by applying tariffs usually backfires. So whether itâ€™s China, US or European Union, the numbers will show this. And that will be the trigger for change. But it will take time to get back to where we were.When China joined WTO in 2001 it was hailed as a grand success. However, that sentiment has reversed in the US. Why?I personally believe that having China in WTO and world trading system is good for everybody. Thereâ€™s a sense from this administration that China has taken advantage of the US. That is President Trumpâ€™s view and the metric that they look at is the trade deficit. So if a trading partner has a surplus then that trading partner is winning. Ironically, this year the deficit is increasing. But if you talk to businesses they are not thinking of the trade deficit. They are thinking of China 2025, data localisation, IPR, technology transfers â€“ all the things that China wants to do. Thatâ€™s what worries business. So there is a lack of synchronisation between the business community and the administration. Which is why we tell companies that they need to have their own foreign policy.Where will the tit-for-tat tariff retaliation between the US and China end?Itâ€™s a trade war. Itâ€™s hard to see there will be a surrender ceremony like in a war. Itâ€™s more likely there will be a negotiated settlement. But something that could be the outcome of this trade war is that we find a way for two different systems to co-exist. Up until now, the policy and thrust has been to change China. The key issue is how much will China change. China has changed and it will continue to change. But does that mean China will have a system like the US? I donâ€™t think so. So there could be this recognition that these two different systems have to co-exist in this world and we negotiate how they co-exist without having breaches of IPR or having policies that go against international trade and investment.Even EU has been impacted by Trumpâ€™s trade policies. Is a re-orientation of the trans-Atlantic relationship in the offing?The US and EU have been talking about a trade agreement for quite a while. There are big differences that need to be ironed out between the two. I donâ€™t see that happening today, particularly because the Trump administration doesnâ€™t like multilateral agreements. In the short term there have been some positive statements by Germany regarding automobiles. So thereâ€™s a sense that EU would like to have things settled.Was it a mistake for the US to pull out of TPP? And do you see the US coming back into the agreement at some point?I would have advised against pulling out. But the fact that Japan has picked up the mantle and is championing TPP-11 is a positive thing for Asia. In fact, itâ€™s interesting that Japan chose that route rather than an FTA with the US. So the TPP is alive and they have kept a carve-out for the US. Will the US join one day? I would say yes. When? I am not sure. The US cannot be shut out of Asia and its only agreements today with the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Australia are not enough. We are woefully under-represented in Asia. Meanwhile, China is moving ahead with RCEP. So American companies will be shut out unless the US adopts a different trade policy towards Asia.India and the US share a growing strategic relationship. However, there are differences on the economic front. How can the two be reconciled?Our systems and markets are different. But over the years India has been steadily progressing in terms of opening up and becoming a part of the international trading system. Itâ€™s asking too much of India to get to where the US is after 230 years when India has been at it since the 1950s. In that regard, we will continue trading, we will have differences, we will negotiate those differences, and then look back 10 years from now and see the progress we have made. It will require patience, a common vision and understanding of each otherâ€™s aspirations. But our relationship will continue to grow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON (AP) â€“ President Donald Trump is embracing the potential for a trade war after announcing his intent to place tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, as he rebuffs allies who have pushed to be exempted from the stiff duties.The protectionist policy will be made official in the next two weeks, White House officials said Sunday, as the administration defended the decision from critics in Washington and overseas.Trump appeared unbowed Sunday, as he tweeted that American â€œSteel and Aluminium industries are dead. Sorry, itâ€™s time for a change!â€?Trumpâ€™s pronouncement Thursday that he would impose tariffs of 25 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, on imported steel and aluminium, roiled markets and rankled allies. While his rhetoric has been focussed on China, the duties will also cover significant imports from Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Japan and the European Union (EU).Speaking on CNNâ€™s â€˜State of the Unionâ€™, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said, â€œAt this point in time thereâ€™s no country exclusions.â€?The across-the-board action breaks with the recommendation of the Pentagon, which pushed for more targeted tariffs on metals imports from countries like China and warned that a wide-ranging move would jeopardise national security partnerships. But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose agency oversaw reviews of the industries that recommended the tariffs, said Sunday ABCâ€™s â€˜This Weekâ€™ that Trump is â€œtalking about a fairly broad brushâ€?.Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said the sweeping action would let China â€œoff the hookâ€?, adding the tariffs would drive a wedge between the US and its allies.â€œChina wins when we fight with Europe,â€? he said on CBSâ€™s â€˜Face the Nationâ€™. â€œChina wins when the American consumer has higher prices because of tariffs that donâ€™t affect Chinese behaviour.â€?Trump has threatened to tax European cars if the EU boosts tariffs on American products in response to the presidentâ€™s plan to increase duties on steel and aluminium.British Prime Minister Theresa May raised her â€œdeep concernâ€? at the tariff announcement in a phone call with Trump Sunday.Mayâ€™s office said she â€œraised our deep concern at the presidentâ€™s forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacityâ€?.But Ross rejected threats of retaliation from American allies as â€œpretty trivialâ€? and not much more than a â€œrounding errorâ€?.Few issues could blur the lines of partisanship in Trump-era Washington. Trade is one of them.Labour unions and liberal Democrats are in the unusual position of applauding Trumpâ€™s approach, while Republicans and an array of business groups are warning of dire economic and political consequences if he goes ahead with the tariffs.Trade politics often cut along regional, rather than ideological, lines, as politicians reflect the interests of the hometown industries and workers. But rarely does a debate open so wide a rift between a president and his party â€“ leaving him almost exclusively with support from his ideological opposites.â€œGood, finally,â€? said Sen Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat and progressive as he cheered Trumpâ€™s move. Sen Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, a Democrat who has called for Trump to resign, agreed.â€œI urge the administration to follow through and to take aggressive measures to ensure our workers can compete on a level playing field,â€? Casey tweeted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Speaking at a conference in early June, Vancouver-based Teck Resources Ltd.â€™s chief executive Don Lindsay raved that his company invested â€œin the right commodities at the right time,â€? with a nod to one of its biggest bets â€” copper.Lindsay predicted copper soon would hit US$3.50 per pound, at which point his companyâ€™s long-planned Quebrada Blanca 2 project â€” a 300,000-ton per year copper mine to be constructed in northern Chileâ€™s high desert â€” would add $1 billion dollars per year in cash flow.â€œThat price is not far off,â€? he said at the June conference in Chicago, organized by Deutsche Bank, at a time when copper had experienced nearly a year of gains.But instead of increasing, at the end of June, copper prices started a free fall, dropping 15.7 per cent from US$3.29 per pound to a new one-year low of US$2.77. Benchmark copper fell 1 per cent to US$6,174 per tonne, hovering near one-year lows. Prices are down about 14 per cent in 2018.Now CIBC Capital Market analysts have pinned Quebrada Blanca 2 â€” which Teck had suggested could begin construction this year, depending on permitting and other factors â€” as a likely casualty if a trade war erupts between U.S. and China. It represents one of the ways in which growing fears of a trade war are already hitting the mining sector.Such fears took hold in mid-June when the U.S. raised US$50 billion in tariffs on China, and an additional US$200 billion this week.Base metals from copper to zinc have dropped, and itâ€™s rubbing off on mining companies. Base metal producers have already lost $3.5 billion in market capitalization, according to a CIBC analysis of one group of North American companies.â€œWe expect cooler heads to prevail because an all-out trade war could sink the global economy into recession,â€? CIBC analysts wrote.Teck Resources is down 14.6 per cent to US$24.56 on Friday morning from US$28.75 on June 14.Throughout presentations during the past year, Teck management cited Quebrada Blanca 2 as a top means the company will achieve growth in coming years, and analysts have viewed its largest transactions, including the $1.3 billion sale of Waneta Dam to B.C. Hydro, expected to close later this year, as a means to raise capital for the copper mine.A Teck spokesman called Quebrada Blanca 2 the companyâ€™s â€œpriority growth project,â€? but acknowledged that expected commodity prices, both in the short and long term, play a role in whether the mine will be built.The long-term outlook for copper had been nearly exuberant at the start of the summer, with Lindsay and many others predicting a structural deficit, in which demand exceeds supply, by 2020.Such a deficit could help copper projects weather a slowdown caused by a trade war. Stephen Gill, managing director of Pala Investments and a director of Nevada Copper, said earlier this summer, that based on his review of global copper projects, a significant copper deficit will emerge by 2025 even at two per cent global growth per year.â€œThe thesis of copper is lack of supply,â€? Gill said.Indeed, his company, which is building an open pit and underground mine in Nevada, closed an oversubscribed $96 million offering this week at 60 cents per share â€” above its current 58 cent per share price.Still, mining industry executives, from companies big and small, said they are already feeling the effects and fallout from a possible U.S.-China trade war â€” a battle that by disrupting the normal flow of the market is leaving Canadian companies as collateral damage.Jack Stoch, chief executive of strategy of Globex Mining Enterprises Inc., a Toronto-based company which develops mining projects â€” from precious metals, to base metals and rare earths and sells them to larger companies â€”, lamented the market conditions.Stoch said one deal to sell a property recently fell apart after the buyerâ€™s stock price declined to the point that the company could no longer afford to front enough shares to match the agreed upon purchase value.â€œWe had a deal all worked out,â€? he said. â€œThey paid a $100,000 down payment and while they were doing their due diligence, which took several months, the metal prices kept going down, and their stock price went down to the point the exchange refused to approve the deal because it would have been too dilutive for the company.â€?â€¢ Email: gfriedman@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GabeFriedz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is the first instalment in Access Denied, a four-part series on protectionism in Canada and beyondIn 2002, a former Brazilian engineer born into a family of cattle ranchers and sugar farmers took on the United States government. Pedro Camargo, who had joined Brazilâ€™s Department of Agriculture following a mid-life career change, believed the U.S. was unfairly subsidizing its cotton industry. At his urging, the Brazilian government lodged a complaint at the World Trade Organization and a dispute panel in 2005 ruled in its favour.What followed is one of the more outlandish entries in the annals of global trade. After a long string of failed appeals, the U.S. was told to eliminate all subsidies for its politically influential cotton growers. Congress balked.Brazil threatened retaliatory tariffs on a laundry list of U.S. goods: tires, intellectual property, pharmaceuticals and cars. American industry balked.The U.S. government then made an offer: it would pay $147.3 million per year to Brazilian farmers if Brazil dropped its complaint.â€œIt was very bizarre because (the U.S.) only had about 5,000 farmers then,â€? Camargo said in an interview. â€œIt was a payoff and they were paying, basically, to get out of the rules.â€?The cotton dispute, while unusual, is a good illustration of just how far countries will go to support politically sensitive industries. Itâ€™s also proof of what every trade negotiator knows: almost every country, including Canada and the U.S., has a contentious policy or two, not necessarily hidden, but largely unnoticed until another country wags an accusatory finger.Of the $900 billion in annual trade flowing between Canada and the U.S., the vast majority of it is tariff free under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Dig a little deeper, though, and youâ€™ll find the aberrations, the policies that aggravate, frustrate or otherwise irk relations between the trading partners and, on occasion, prompt accusations of protectionism.In Canada, it might be courier services or telecommunications, where restrictions are among the toughest in the developed world. In the U.S., it might be the heavily regulated maritime transport industry or insurance services. Both countries might have a bone to pick with each other â€” and others â€” on agricultural policy.â€œThereâ€™s certainly no clear case to be made that Canada is more protectionist than the United States,â€? said Alan Deardorff, a professor of international economics at the University of Michigan. â€œThatâ€™s just nonsense. That doesnâ€™t mean individual tariffs are the same, not at all. Each country has particular objectives and sectors it protects more than other sectors.â€?In tweets, U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Canada of having â€œall sorts of trade barriers on our Agricultural products,â€? treating U.S. agricultural businesses and farmers â€œvery poorly,â€? and being â€œhighly restrictive on Trade!â€?Some form of government aid, be it subsidies, tariffs, price supports or other interventions, contributes 9.6 cents of every dollar that goes to Canadian agricultural producers, according to 2017 data compiled by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development. Thatâ€™s just slightly below the U.S. at 9.9 cents per dollar.Both countriesâ€™ rates are below the OECD average, though Canadaâ€™s share of aid delivered through market price supports â€” one of the policies considered most â€œdistortive to tradeâ€? â€” is higher.The main recipient of that largesse: Dairy.Between 2015 and 2017, the government contributed 44.7 cents of every dollar going to Canadian dairy producers, almost all of it coming from market price supports, according to the OECDâ€™s measure of single commodity transfers (STCs), which provides an estimate of the total dollar value transferred via government policy from taxpayers and consumers to agricultural producers.Dairy farmers receive the most support of any Canadian agricultural sector, through a complex supply management system that employs production quotas, fixed prices and hefty import duties, said Jared Greenville, senior agricultural policy analyst at the OECD. After dairy, support for most other Canadian food, including soybeans, barley, oats and rapeseed, drops to a few pennies at most.â€œIf it werenâ€™t for dairy, Canada would be, I guess, one of the champions of better access and freer access in world agricultural markets,â€? he said, noting that Canada is a member of the Cairns group of 19 countries seeking to liberalize global trade in agriculture. â€œIn fact, if you were to take dairy out of it, Canada provides less distortionary support to agriculture than the U.S.â€?Yet Canada isnâ€™t the only country whose support for the dairy industry â€” one of the most protected group of commodities globally â€” has been called out by other countries. Between 2015 and 2017, 19 cents out of every dollar that went to U.S. dairy producers came from government support, all of it via market distorting measures, according to the OECD.If it werenâ€™t for dairy, Canada would be, I guess, one of the champions of better access and freer access in world agricultural markets, Jared Greenville, senior agricultural policy analyst at the OECDNew Zealand and Australia, which demanded greater access to Canadian markets during talks to form the Trans-Pacific Partnership, also took issue with the U.S.â€œThis was a big issue for the U.S., too, in the TPP,â€? said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C.And dairy isnâ€™t the only agricultural product that the U.S. supports with trade-distorting measures. At nearly 54 cents on every dollar, U.S. sugar producers received the most relative support between 2015 and 2017, with 32 cents of that coming from market price support. Likewise, nine cents of every dollar going to sheep meat producers is through SCTs, all of it from market-distorting measures, the OECD noted.â€œThe point is that everybody is doing something on agriculture,â€? said Debra Steger, a law professor at the University of Ottawa and a former senior trade negotiator for the Canadian government. â€œWhat I donâ€™t think is fair is to just pick on Canada for dairy and act like the U.S. isnâ€™t doing anything.â€?Countries have plenty of motivations for supporting agricultural producers. Some hope it will slow the rate of rural decline and postpone the problem of how to employ large quantities of labourers when farms disappear. Developing countries, in particular, often cite food security as a concern.There is also evidence that as populations become wealthier and more urban, they are more willing to pay to protect their agricultural sectors for nostalgic reasons, Hufbauer said. In many cases, he added, the political lobbying power of agricultural producers can throw off reform.Ironically, one of the main reasons agriculture supports have stubbornly remained in place can be traced back to the U.S., which led the global charge to liberalize trade coming out of the Second World War.Following the 1930s imposition of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs â€” generally believed to have exacerbated the Great Depression â€” it was hoped that a low tariff agenda would cement bonds between Western nations and promote shared prosperity. But U.S. Congress insisted on an exemption for agriculture.Until the Uruguay round, the multilateral negotiation that began in 1986 and ultimately formed the World Trade Organization, â€œcountries could basically do whatever they wanted in terms of agriculture,â€? Hufbauer said.In general, countries that have remained open to trade, that haven't erected barriers including tariffs, have grown faster, they have higher incomes, higher productivity, Jerome Powell, U.S. Federal Reserve chairmanEconomists have long championed freer trade, arguing that lower tariffs encourage countries to specialize in what they produce best and most efficiently, while allowing other countries to buy those products at better prices, reserving their own labour and capital for more productive means.â€œIn general, countries that have remained open to trade, that havenâ€™t erected barriers including tariffs, have grown faster, they have higher incomes, higher productivity,â€? U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in Senate testimony on Tuesday. â€œCountries that have gone in a more protectionist direction have done worse. I think thatâ€™s the empirical result.â€?Removing tariffs might be better for an economy overall, but it also exposes companies that canâ€™t compete and, in practice, politicians have allowed protections to hang around rather than deal with the fallout of lost jobs.A look at the services trade suggests Canada and the U.S. are both less restrictive than most countries, scoring below average in the 22 sectors covered in the OECDâ€™s Services Trade Restrictiveness Index. But, here again, each country has its sacred cows.No. 1 for Canada: telecommunications, where policies on foreign ownership are among the most restrictive of all OECD countries.Foreign ownership is limited to no more than 20 per cent of a companyâ€™s voting shares and no more than 33.3 per cent of the voting shares of a carrierâ€™s holding company. In addition, 80 per cent of the board members must be Canadian nationals. These rules, however, do not apply to telecoms with less than 10 per cent of the market share.Postal and courier service is another area of tight control, with Canada Post Corp. holding a monopoly on all letters weighing less than 500 grams, which is heavier than most other countries.In the U.S., maritime law states that goods can only be transported between U.S. ports if they are carried on U.S.-built ships that are flying U.S. flags and crewed by Americans. The shipping company must have at least three-quarters U.S. ownership, and the chief executive, chair of the board and majority of directors must be U.S. citizens.The U.S. also places unusually tight restrictions on foreign involvement in the insurance industry, freight forwarding and customs brokerage.â€œThese policies carve out a large portion of the market for domestic players and the result is that consumers pay more because there is less competition,â€? said Hildegunn Nordas, a senior economist at the OECD.Yet in services, as in any form of trade, there is a fine line to be drawn between barriers that exist for public policy reasons and those that are purely designed to disguise protection, said Daniel Trefler, a trade economist and Canada Research Chair in Competitiveness and Prosperity at the University of Torontoâ€™s Rotman School of Management.The airline industry, Trefler points out, is one of the most protected sectors in the world. The limitations on foreign ownership of Canadian airlines was recently raised by the federal government to 49 per cent from 25 per cent, although no single international investor can hold more than 25 per cent of the voting shares. The U.S. has similar restrictions.Countries will often argue that protecting the airline industry ensures a certain amount of control over the movement of people, particularly in remote areas. Were a U.S. company to take over Air Canada, for instance, it might find it more profitable to cancel a route between two less populated cities in the North in order to focus resources elsewhere.â€œCompetition has a massive impact on the price charged to consumers,â€? Trefler said. â€œSo when Air Canada has a route that competes with Porter, prices are much lower. I mean substantially lower. I understand if the government wants to help a portion of the population who are in difficult-to-access areas of Canada. The easiest way to do that is any airline that flies that route, you will give them $100 to $200 for each passenger. But donâ€™t disrupt the competitive environment to reach that goal.â€?Restrictions in other industries can also be severe, but serve a different purpose. For example, Canadian banks wield enormous power over the market and limit consumer choice, but Trefler said that completely opening the sector could be risky.â€œWe run the risk of having our financial sector, which is systemically important to the country, being taken over by American companies,â€? he said. â€œIt could open us up to massive financial instability.â€?The same argument applies to Canadaâ€™s screening system for foreign direct investment, Trefler said.The Investment Canada Act evaluates foreign purchases of more than $1 billion to determine if they are a â€œnet benefitâ€? to Canada, either in terms of providing jobs or offering other opportunities. By comparison, the U.S. selectively screens purchases and evaluates whether they are a risk to national security. In both cases, the impact comes down to how the laws are exercised.â€œYou can say those are restrictive, I guess,â€? Trefler said. â€œBut in China, for instance, even though there are likely clear rules on foreign investment, crony capitalism means the situation is far different on the ground.â€?Tariffs and border measures are just one way to protect industry, and there have been growing concerns since the late 1980s that trade-restricting non-tariff barriers â€” or NTBs â€” have risen as tariffs have fallen, said Dan Ciuriak, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, Ont.NTBs can include licensing requirements, regulations and delaying inspections of products at the borders, and their effects are difficult to quantify. Evidence suggests the use of anti-dumping and countervailing duties that use tariffs to protect domestic industry from imports being sold at less than a fair price have also increased, Ciuriak said.â€œThere are tools for safeguards under trade agreements, but often it takes too long to get approval under the rules to use them,â€? he said. â€œSo these other tools have come into greater use as safeguards.Who benefits from all these policies? Not the consumer. Canadaâ€™s system of dairy supply management, for example, costs families an extra $444 a year, according to a recent study by the University of Calgary.â€œBehind every tariff wall, you see the emergence of inefficient practices,â€? Ciuriak said. â€œThe optimal outcome is free trade. This is a theoretical target, of course. We donâ€™t live in a perfect world, but what we do know is the more trade we have, the better off we are. And when tariffs are not there for corrective reasons â€” for example, to correct for a subsidy â€” they drive a wedge between countriesâ€™ cost structures and ultimately cost consumers more.â€?But if you are going to call another country out on its trade policies, trade economists say, youâ€™d better be ready to defend your own.Financial Postâ€¢ Email: npowell@nationalpost.com | Twitter: naomi_powell",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON, United States â€“ President Donald Trump on Monday effectively broadsided one of the worldâ€™s largest trade relationships, announcing plans to proceed with tariffs on another $200 billion in US imports of Chinese goods.Taken with the $50 billion in tariffs already in place, this means roughly half of everything Americans buy from China â€” their largest source for imports â€” is now subject to punitive import duties.ADVERTISEMENTWhole industrial sectors stand to feel the effects, including agriculture, manufacturing, textiles and retail.Meanwhile, China, which is Americaâ€™s third-largest export market, has vowed to counter-attack with plans to slap tariffs on another $60 billion in US exports, meaning about 80 percent of US exports to China would be subject to retaliation.Here is a rundown of some of the products in question.Half of Chinese exportsThe Trump administration says its aggressive stance is to pressure Beijing to change policies that allow for the theft of US technology and undercut American producers.Trump started out in July and August with a more modest $50 billion round of tariffs targeting aircraft parts, computer hard drives, machinery and appliances, optical and surgical equipment as well as autos â€” goods Washington said had benefited from unfair trade practices.But Mondayâ€™s announcement moves things up by an order of magnitude. According to a preliminary list released in July, the administration is now targeting $8.4 billion in plastics, $64.8 billion in electrical machinery, $55.1 billion in appliances and $25.8 billion in furniture as well as broad ranges of seafood and meat.Other items that have been on the US target list since the summer include milking machines for dairy cows, incubators for baby chicks, flight data recorders, x-ray tubes, bulldozers and arc lamps as well as motorcycles and mopeds.China hits backChinese imports from the United States grew by nearly 500 percent over the past five years, such that as of 2017 Chinese buyers accounted for almost one in every five dollars in US export revenue.Beijing has since accused the United States of starting the â€œlargest trade war in economic history.â€? In retaliating, China in July announced tariffs on American agricultural goods and autos. Also in Beijingâ€™s crosshairs are exports like hybrid electric and off-road vehicles, coal, dump trucks, asphalt, MRI machines and motorcycles, among other items.ADVERTISEMENTHarley-Davidson will have to bump up the Chinese price of its iconic motorbikes at least 20 percent, a store representative in Beijing said. That adds to the American beef, pork, many types of fish, and dozens of fruits and nuts that were taxed in July.The most painful perhaps is the tariff on US soybeans, which chokes off a key export market for American farmers, who shipped $14 billion of the beans to China last year.If China then slaps tariffs on another $60 billion in US goods, this will bring total US exports subject to Beijingâ€™s retaliation to $110 billion, at 2017 sales levels.Where Washington pulled its punchesWith 50 days to go before crucial mid-term elections and many in Trumpâ€™s own Republican party are queasy about Trumpâ€™s trade wars, which have drawn loud objections from senior figures within the party.American officials said Monday they were conscious of the need for American businesses to find alternative suppliers before the tariffs hit.â€œIf the tariffs go to 25 percent at the beginning of the year, you will have had almost six months to get your business ready for that,â€? a senior administration official told reporters on Monday.In a further attempt to cushion the blow, Washington canceled plans to put tariffs on about 300 product categories, including hot consumer items like smart watches and Bluetooth-enabled devices, chemicals for manufacturing, agriculture and textiles, as well as bicycle helmets, and childrenâ€™s high chairs, car seats and play pens. /cbbRead Next",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Asian markets rally as Xi soothes fears of a China-US trade war 35 SHARES Share it! Share TweetBy Agence France-PresseAsian markets rallied Tuesday after Chinese President Xi Jinping eased worries over a simmering US trade conflict by promising new measures to open his countryâ€™s massive economy â€œwider and widerâ€?.In a closely watched speech at the Boao Forum â€” dubbed the Asian Davos â€” he pledged a â€œnew phase of opening upâ€?, adding that Beijing â€œdoes not seek a trade surplusâ€? and wants to boost imports.After starting the day cautiously, dealers pounced on the comments as a sign that a possible trade war between the worldâ€™s top two powers can be averted.Markets have been roiled in recent weeks as the White House has announced a series of tariffs mostly on Chinese goods as part of his â€œAmerica Firstâ€? protectionist agenda, fuelling fears of potentially devastating tit-for-tat measures that could hammer the global economy.Chinaâ€™s massive surplus with the US is a key complaint of Trumpâ€™s who accuses the country of unfair trade practices that hurt American jobs.His latest measures on Friday battered US stocks, though hopes the issue can be resolved saw Asia post gains on at the start of this week.â€œXiâ€™s speech sends a positive signal to the market since he backs globalisation and the opening up of China market,â€? Linus Yip, a strategist at First Shanghai Securities, told Bloomberg News.â€œInvestors were very worried about trade disputes, while his speech calms the nerves a lot. The concern about trade disputes in near-term are still here however, since what Xi pictures is a very long-term picture.â€?â€“ Fresh Trump probe woe â€“Shanghai climbed 0.5 percent, Hong Kong jumped 0.9 percent and Tokyo added more than one percent by the break.Sydney â€” where a number of firms are listed that rely on China trade â€” rose 0.8 percent, Singapore put on 0.2 percent and Seoul added 0.3 percent.There were also healthy gains in Wellington, Taipei and Indonesia.After last weekâ€™s plunge, all three main indexes on Wall Street ended in positive territory Monday but eased from earlier highs after it emerged the FBI had raided the offices of Trumpâ€™s long-time personal lawyer.Michael Cohen has admitted to paying porn actress Stephanie Clifford $130,000. Clifford, who goes by Stormy Daniels, claims she received the money to cover up a sexual encounter with Trump more than a decade ago.The move is the latest volley in special counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s probe into possible Russia collusion with Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign.It adds to the sense of turmoil on Pennsylvania Avenue and Trump slammed the raid as â€œdisgracefulâ€?, a â€œwitch-huntâ€? and â€œan attack on our countryâ€?.Adding to uncertainty for traders are geopolitical worries after an alleged toxic gas attack that killed dozens in a rebel-held Syrian town, which prompted Trump to indicate a decision could be taken imminently on military action.Russia, which backs the Syrian regime, has warned against such a move, saying it could have â€œgrave repercussionsâ€?.Tensions in the Middle East have buoyed oil prices, which extended Mondayâ€™s rally, with gains also helped by speculation the US will tear up the Iran nuclear deal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"EU slaps tariffs on US as trade war erupts 93 SHARES Share it! Share TweetBy Agence France-PresseThe European Union slapped revenge tariffs on iconic US products including bourbon, jeans and motorcycles on Friday in its opening salvo in a trade war with President Donald Trump.The tariffs, which took effect at midnight (2200 GMT Thursday) according to the EUâ€™s official journal, will further fuel jitters on world stock markets that are already alarmed by trade tensions between the United States and China.Customs agents across the Europeâ€™s colossal market of 500 million people will now impose the duty, hiking prices on US-made products in supermarkets and across factory floors.Brussels imposed the raft of duties on US products worth 2.8 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in a tit-for-tat response to Trumpâ€™s decision to slap stiff tariffs on European steel and aluminium exports.EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said this week that the 28-nation bloc was â€œleft with no other choiceâ€? but to impose tariffs of its own after the â€œunilateral and unjustified decision of the US.â€?Together with US tariffs against Mexico and Canada, the trade battles have raised the specter of a global trade war, spooking financial markets that fear major consequences to the global economy.â€œWe have a trade war â€” and itâ€™s an escalating trade war,â€? SEB chief economist Robert Bergqvist told AFP in an interview.Brussels first drew up the list in March when Trump initially floated the 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminium, which also target Canada, Mexico and other close allies.The list does not specifically name brands but European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker spelled out in March that the bloc would target â€œHarley-Davidson, bourbon and Leviâ€™s jeansâ€?.Cranberries, cranberry juice, orange juice, sweetcorn and peanut butter are among the other food products targeted.The list also hits clothing along with bed linen and menâ€™s leather footwear, eye make-up and lipsticks, plus a host of steel products.â€˜Against all logicâ€™Juncker said on Thursday that the US decision to impose tariffs â€œgoes against all logic and historyâ€?.â€œOur response must be clear but measured. We will do what we have to do to rebalance and safeguard,â€? he said.European consumers would be able to find â€œalternativesâ€?, European Commission Vice President for trade Jyrki Katainen said.â€œIf we chose products like Harley Davidson, peanut butter and bourbon, itâ€™s because there are alternatives on the market. We donâ€™t want to do anything that would harm consumers,â€? he said on Thursday.â€œWhatâ€™s more, these products will have a strong symbolic political impact.â€?Analyst Bergqvist argued that his â€œmain concernâ€? over a trade war was the impact on stock markets â€” and the subsequent knock-on effect for the world economy.â€œAll these kind of things going on right now could trigger that kind of behavior and initiate a correction in the stock markets, and that could also trigger a slowdown in the global economy,â€? he said.Relations reach new lowsTransatlantic ties are at their lowest level for many years due to rows over a host of issues including the tariffs, the Paris climate agreement, the Iran nuclear deal and the new US embassy in Jerusalem.Relations plumbed new depths at the recent G7 summit when Trump abruptly rejected the joint statement and bitterly insulted his Canadian host, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Trump claimed America had been obliged to levy the metals tariffs as it has been exploited as the worldâ€™s â€œpiggy bankâ€?. He is also targeting EU auto imports with a US probe now underway.Trumpâ€™s outbursts were the latest in which he has clashed with Americaâ€™s closest allies, even as he has had warm words for autocrats like North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, with whom he had a historic meeting last week, and Russiaâ€™s Vladimir Putin.But US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs Wess Mitchell said on Thursday that Trumpâ€™s approach towards his allies was about â€œstrategic renovationâ€?.â€œStrengthening the West means making hard decisions today when we initially disagree, rather than continuing to accept the appearance of transatlantic unity for the sake of avoiding disagreement,â€? he told the Carnegie Europe think-tank in Brussels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is all going to end up like life after Ronald Reagan â€” higher taxes for working stiffs to bail out Uncle Sam. â€” Linda LewandowskiWhatâ€™s the tab for expressway marches?The Rev. Michael Pfleger led a protest march that shut down the north-bound lanes of the Dan Ryan Expressway earlier this month. Now, Rev. Gregory Livingston has planned a march for Aug. 2 down Lake Shore Drove and to Wrigley Field, just about when a Cubs night game starts.The obvious question that no one wants to answer: How much did it cost taxpayers to provide law enforcement and other security measures for Pflegerâ€™s march?

"President Donald Trump has moved forward with new tariffs on imported metals, despite negative reactions from Republican lawmakers and manufacturers. However, he has reserved the right to make changes to the tariffs moving forward on a country-by-country basis.Canada and Mexico will be at least temporarily exempted from Trumpâ€™s 10% tariff on imported aluminum and a 25% tariff on imported steel as NAFTA negotiations continue, and other allies could see reduced tariffs, according to Trump.While the current trade balance may not be favorable to the U.S., updating existing trade agreements could help fix that imbalance without inviting a trade war of retaliatory tariffs or boosting prices for consumers.â€œA trade war is not a productive path, so what has been proposed requires substantial revision,â€? Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, Senior Associate Dean for Leadership Studies at the Yale School of Management told Chief Executive. â€œAt the same time, there are some profound asymmetries which have been unfair to the U.S. and much of the west from China, and with unequal terms with Europe in key products. As with NAFTA, updating, rather than open war, is the way to go.â€?â€œ[Tariffs] are going to invite retaliation from our trading partners and allies, and theyâ€™re going to erase much of the benefit of tax reform.â€? â€“ Global Automakers CEO John BozzellaLawmakers including House Speaker Paul Ryan have raised concerns over the tariffs, and are worried they could have a negative impact on the economic gains provided by the recent tax reform law.U.S. manufacturers have also spoken out against the plan, including the automotive and beverage industry, which could be heavily impacted by tariffs.Global Automakers CEO John Bozzella told Fox News that he is â€œvery concernedâ€? about the tariffs and what it will mean for auto prices and consumers.â€œThese tariffs will raise prices on American consumers for cars and trucks that are actually built in America,â€? Bozzella said. â€œTheyâ€™re going to invite retaliation from our trading partners and allies, and theyâ€™re going to erase much of the benefit of tax reform. Tax reform benefits that would have been used to invest in plants and equipment now are going to be used to pay for higher steel and aluminum [costs].â€?United Steelworkers International has shown strong support for the tariff plan.â€œFor the USW, the objective has always been to restore market-based economics that ensure that our domestic producers can achieve a fair return as they invest in facilities, equipment and people, and contribute to the strength of our nation,â€? United Steelworkers International President Leo W. Gerard said in a statement. â€œThe objective should also be to reduce the negative impact of steel and aluminum imports that have decimated production in the United States. The tariff levels the President announced will help to achieve that objective.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I owe President Trump an apology. I made the mistake of taking him seriously.See, earlier this month when the president pledged to implement steel and aluminum tariffs worldwide, I wrote:These tariffs are gonna happen. I seriously doubt there will be any scaling back. And contrary to the airy dismissals of advocates such as Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, theyâ€™re a big frigginâ€™ deal.â€¦ this is not an issue on which Trumpâ€™s beliefs are protean. Trump is not and never has been a fan of free trade, particularly multilateral free trade agreements like the World Trade Organization. Trump may be poorly informed on trade but his beliefs on this issue are very deep â€¦.These tariffs are going to happen. I seriously doubt there will be any exemptions for allies and partners. Itâ€™s basically a tax on consumers and corporate welfare for aluminum and steel producers. And the whole thing is very, very stupid. Just three weeks later, the picture looks very different. As it turned out, the Trump administration exempted a fair number of allies: Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, the European Union and South Korea. With those countries representing more than half of Americaâ€™s steel imports, suddenly the announced tariffs did not seem quite so punishing.Of course, those exemptions were temporary, and the Trump administration hoped to negotiate significant trade concessions in return for permanent relief. The hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts had its doubts that this would work.The first new trade deal was announced Monday, with South Korea. The New York Times reported that the renegotiated United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) â€œappeared to be an early vindication of the White Houseâ€™s efforts to use the penalties as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations.â€?Most other reports suggest, however, that this is a poor interpretation of the new deal. The Wall Street Journalâ€™s Kwanwoo Jun looks under the hood and reports the details:Under the concessions negotiated with Seoul, the US will be allowed to retain a 25% tariff on pickup trucks for an additional 20 years. The truck tariffs had been set to expire in 2021, so the deal significantly expands the protection applied to US trucks. And South Korea would double the import quota for American-made cars meeting US safety rules â€“ but not Korean ones â€“ to an annual 50,000 units per carmaker, up from 25,000 units currently.But US carmakers donâ€™t export enough to hit the quota of 25,000 that exist now, and the move to maintain truck tariffs could also have limited impact. Kia Motors Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. both have developed pickup trucks â€“ the Mohave and the Santa Cruz â€“ but neither has entered the US market. The Korean carmakers are mostly focused on producing sedans for North America. â€œI donâ€™t think the KORUS deal is particularly significant economically,â€? said Tami Overby, a longtime Washington-based advocate for US businesses with interests in South Korea â€¦.South Korea also agreed to a limit on the amount of steel it can export each year to the US â€“ 2.68 million tons, or 70% of its annual average for the past three years.This interpretation jibes with coverage from other sources, as well.So, to sum up: The revised trade deal makes changes that have zero effect on the current flow of goods and services between the two countries, except that it imposes a voluntary export restraint on South Korean steel exports to the United States. That, frankly, hurts American steel-consuming industries just as much as it hurts the Korean steel sector.This is not a great outcome: Voluntary export restraints are a truly stupid trade measure, and the switch from free trade to managed trade is regrettable. That said, this deal does not distort the pattern of bilateral trade all that much, and it forestalls a bigger trade war. One reason the stock market soared Monday was that the fears of an escalating trade war seem less likely.Over the past few weeks, I have not been the only trade analyst who has been gloomy about the coming trade wars. A week ago the Peterson Institute for International Economicsâ€™ Adam Posen warned: â€œ[Trumpâ€™s] launching a trade war would prove, however, to be his economic Afghanistan â€“ costly, open-ended, and fruitless.â€? The Financial Timesâ€™ Shawn Donnan made a similar argument:While there is a broad consensus in Washington that the US needs a more muscular response to a rising China, there is real concern that the Trump administration appears to lack a strategy for ending the war it is about to start â€¦.Mr Trumpâ€™s supporters argue that the president is trying to force exactly that by creating real consequences for China rather than engage in the endless talks and World Trade Organization litigation that embroiled previous administrations.There is another possibility, too. Mr Trumpâ€™s military-style trade bombast replicates the â€œfire and furyâ€? rhetoric he employed with North Korea. Together with toughened sanctions that, he believes, led to Pyongyang caving. Emboldened, Mr Trump is about to launch a trade war he believes he can win. The Korea deal suggests that many trade analysts â€“ myself included â€“ were overly pessimistic. If this negotiation proves to be the norm, then the administration is more cynical on trade than I previously thought. The Trump team appears comfortable pocketing token concessions and claiming victory rather than implementing tariffs. Like the president, the administrationâ€™s trade negotiators are phony-tough. Which is fine by me, because real trade wars are expensive and produce no winners.By now it is clear that this administrationâ€™s trade policy is at least a decade out of date. But it also appears to recognize that it does possess a strong bargaining position. Trade wars are easy to win if your definition of victory is modest changes to deals and more managed trade. And on trade, this administration is far more modest than they have teased.Published in Daily Times, April 2nd 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Soybean prices have plunged about 20 percent since April when China first announced the 25 percent tariff on US soybeans.Itâ€™s not just US farmers feeling the pain of lower prices since Canadaâ€™s soybean prices are closely tied the Chicago futures market.Canadian growers could benefit later this year, however, when Brazil supplies slow to a trickle and China needs non-US beans.ina unleashed a retaliatory tariff exactly one week ago on US soybeans, but Canadian growers havenâ€™t been able to escape the fallout.Soybean futures are down nearly 20 percent since early April when Beijing first disclosed plans for the 25 percent duty. Canadaâ€™s soy prices are closely tied the US futures market so farmers from Quebec and Ontario to the Prairie provinces have taken a hit in terms of pricing along with American growers.â€œThe China-US dispute is a negative for Canada in many, many ways because we are being caught in the crossfire,â€? said Benjamin Tal, the deputy chief economist of CIBC World Markets in Toronto.Soybean futures for August delivery plunged as much as 2 percent to near decade lows Friday a day after the US Department of Agriculture forecast record stockpiles of beans in the 2018-19 crop year due to lower anticipated exports as a result of the trade war with China. It also hasnâ€™t helped that talks have not produced any thaw in the trade war with China.â€œWeâ€™re back on the trade fears once again here today,â€? said Ted Seifried, vice president and chief market strategist with Zaner Ag Hedge in Chicago. â€œIt doesnâ€™t seem like thereâ€™s any end in sight and things continue to escalate. And thatâ€™s why soybeans have continued to be under pressure.â€?A net negativeOn the one hand, Canadian soybean farmers could see increased market share selling to China, but experts say the price aspect is much more significant. So the net result is a negative for producers.â€œIf the US price falls, our price basically is the same â€“ it goes down with them,â€? said Ken Ball, a senior commodities future adviser at PI Financial Corp. in Winnipeg. â€œNorth America has really become one large agricultural market with virtually no border, so all of the soybeans produced by a grower in southern Manitoba or Ontario are priced basically directly off the US futures market.â€?Ron Davidson, the executive director of Soy Canada, was quoted last week by the Canadian Press news agency as indicating that prices, since the tariff was announced by Beijing, have essentially given back any gains local growers may have seen from exports to China.â€œCertainly the negative side far outweighs the opportunities for some potential small amount of gain on the positive side,â€? Davidson was quoted as saying.A different scenario could unfold later this year for Canadian producers, however, when Chinaâ€™s soybean shipments from Brazil begin to decline.Possible relief from ChinaBrazil remains the largest seller of soybeans to China, but its exports to China tend to be exhausted in the fall months or December. Canadian soy producers, meanwhile, traditionally begin harvesting their crop in September and have one obvious advantage over Americans: no 25 percent retaliatory import tax.â€œIâ€™m sure Canada will export as much as they can to China,â€? said John Baize, president of John C. Baize and Associates, a consultant for the US Soybean Export Council. â€œThey can do it very easily and even ship all their soybeans to China and then buy US soybeans to supply Canada.â€?As part of its escalating trade tussle with Washington, the Chinese government has been encouraging importers to look for non-US agricultural and food products. Beijing also has sought to assure domestic users that there are sufficient state reserves of soybeans but the actual size of stockpiles is unknown.China buys about two-thirds of the worldâ€™s soybean exports, using most of it for soy protein to feed roughly 700 million pigs in the country or to make cooking oil. The soy also is used for feeding poultry and to support the countryâ€™s fish-farming sector.According to Reuters, Chinese buyers have so far this year accounted for less than 20 percent of all the early purchases of the US fall soybeans, or well below the 10-year average of 60 percent. Instead, the current â€œbargainâ€? prices appear to have sparked interest from other buyers, including Mexico.The Canola alternativeChina has forecast its total soybean imports will be down for the next crop year due to the new tariffs. Another factor is the government is encouraging the use of alternative animal feeds.Experts say Canadaâ€™s canola farmers stand to benefit since the product is used as an alternative livestock feed to soy, although it contains less protein. Canola generates roughly one quarter of all farm cash receipts in Canada.China is already one of the large buyers of Canadian canola, particularly the raw seed, according to the Canola Council of Canada. And Canola prices have been holding up better than soy prices and some of that could be on the expectation of more China buying.Still, Baize said shipments of Canadian soy to China should be able to get a premium price over the US beans since thereâ€™s no tariff involved but probably wonâ€™t fetch as much as Brazilian beans since the protein content is lower. As of this week, Brazilian soybeans were getting premium of about $1.50 a bushel compared with US beans.â€œAs things get tighter in China on soybean supplies, they will bid up the price and Canada could benefit,â€? Baize said.Nonetheless, Canada would likely only be able to fill a small portion of the soybean supplies available from the US market.â€œEven if you look at the most optimistic scenario, it is not even close to replacing the US market,â€? said CIBCâ€™s Tal.Published in Daily Times, July 15th 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The mainstream media focuses its attention on the Trump Administrationâ€™s most colorful characters, even if they are rendered ineffectual by their passion for infighting and talent for exacerbating scandals, like the recent Rob Porter debacle, with poorly coordinated and easily refuted misinformation campaignsBut the executive branch is still staffed with a handful of talented bureaucrats, chief among them U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, who has spent the past year doggedly pursuing the Trump Administrationâ€™s central promise to renegotiate NAFTA to win more favorable terms for U.S. companies and workers, or to withdraw from the trade bloc altogether.Lighthizer is, unlike many of his colleagues, no political neophyteâ€”he served as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative under Ronald Reagan, during the time period when the 40th president, despite his reputation as a staunch free trader, thwarted free-market forces to bring down the U.S. trade deficit through a series of diplomatic negotiations with Japan and other major trade partners, known as the Plaza Accords.For the past twelve months, Lighthizer has been engaged in hard-nosed negotiations with Mexico and Canada, hoping to force the U.S. neighbors to accept new rules that require NAFTA-compliant automobiles to be 50% comprised of parts made in the U.S., and to cut back on the ability of Canadian and Mexican companies to win U.S. government procurement contracts. Publicly, Canadian officials have been optimistic about progress made in the penultimate round of talks held Montreal last weekend, with chief Canadian negotiator Chrystia Freeland saying that the round of talks â€œsurpassed expectations,â€? despite calling U.S. demands â€œunprecedented.â€?Such happy talk is even being dispensed by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who spent the last weekend mounting a charm offensive in California, hoping to build public support for maintenance of the trade agreement. The lefty Trudeau even stooped so low as to lavish praise on the right-wing icon, U.S. president number 40, during a visit to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute in LA last Saturday. But behind the scenes, Canadian officials have been leaking to the press a much grimmer picture, with Reuters reporting last month that negotiators north of the border are â€œincreasingly convinced that President Donald Trump will soon announce the United States intends to pull out of NAFTA.â€?From a strictly political point of view, pulling out of NAFTA makes sense. Criticism of the deal was a cornerstone of Trumpâ€™s 2016 campaign, and polls show that more than 80% of Trump voters see NAFTA as a bad deal for America. Whatâ€™s more, as Trumpâ€™s poll numbers sink, he has been increasingly concerned with keeping his base happy, as their avid support is what gives the president leverage over Capitol Hill Republicans, who in turn can protect him, for the time being, from aggressive Congressional oversight, which could well be his undoing.It was this dynamic that led the President to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accords over the objections of Corporate America and more moderate elements in his own administration, and reporting by Axiosâ€™ Jonathan Swan over the summer indicates the president is desperate to make a big splash on the trade issue as well, demanding that his otherwise reluctant economic team to bring him significant tariffs for him to institute.The best argument that Administration moderates like Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin, who have been pressing for a cautious approach on trade reform have been able to make is that new tariffs, or rash moves like pulling out of NAFTA would cause stock marketsâ€”the presidentâ€™s preferred measure of successâ€”to fall. Indeed, a recent analysis by Oxford Economics predicts that a U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA would cause the S&P 500 to fall by 5%.But Oxford also points out that the U.S. has much less to lose from the dissolution of the trade union than either Cananda or Mexioco, because the American economy relies much less on international trade than its neighbors. This is the sort of leverage the president delights in, and itâ€™s entirely possible that Lighthizer and other hardliners in the administration could convince the president that walking away from the pact is the best way to both play to his base, and to ultimately secure better terms down the road.Christopher Matthews is a writer who splits his time between New York City and Accra, Ghana, with an interest in the intersection of markets, the economy, and public policy.

"The latest tariffs in Donald Trumpâ€™s trade war go into effect, with US duties on another $200 billion in Chinese goods and Beijing responding with levies on $60 billion more in American products.Donald Trump announced the additional tariffs last week, adding to those in May on $50 billion in Chinese imports as he pinned his political hopes to an economic battle with China and US allies such as Canada and the European Union.The Administration now has placed duties on almost half of Chinaâ€™s products, and Trump has threatened to extend them to all imports if Beijing does not make concessions. The latest tariffs will rise from 10% to 25% on January 1.Chinaâ€™s total levies on $110 billion in US products cover almost 80% of American imports.TrumpWatch, Day 606: Trump Steps Up Trade War With ChinaIn the wake of Trumpâ€™s announcement last week, trade talks were suspended. On Monday, Beijing accused the Administration of committing â€œtrade bullyismâ€? and â€œattempting to impose its own interests on China through extreme pressureâ€?.State media reported, â€œIt has brazenly preached unilateralism, protectionism and economic hegemony, making false accusations against many countries and regions, particularly China.â€?The Chinese have also postponed defense-related conversations, after American sanctions were imposed last week on Beijingâ€™s military personnel for buying combat aircraft and missile supplies from Russia.US economists have said the tariffs will cost the US 0.2% in growth, more if Chinese retaliation has an effect. Manufacturers, consumer groups, and many American businesses have criticized the measures, saying they will increase costs of production and thus prices for consumers.A coalition of more than 80 industry and agricultural groups protested on Monday: â€œAmericans are waking up today to a tax increase on the things they rely on to provide for their families.

"US President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade war doesnâ€™t seem to have curtailed American appetite for foreign goods â€” at least not yet.Despite the imposition of tariffs and counter-tariffs in July, the US trade deficit increased to $50.1 billion, a 9.6per cent increase from the previous month, according to the US Census Bureau. The increase came on the back of a 0.9per cent increase in imports to a record $261.2 billion, as US domestic demand remains strong. Exports, on the other hand, slipped 1per cent.For the year, the trade deficit increased to $338 billion, compared to $316 billion in the first seven months of 2017.Trump has repeatedly pointed to the large US trade deficit as one of the primary reasons his administration has embarked on trade fights with China, the European Union , Canada, Mexico, and more.But in addition to the overall deficit, the goods trade deficit with both China and the EU hit record highs in the month of July: a) The goods trade deficit with China increased to $36.8 billion, as imports jumped 5.6per cent and exports tumbled 7.7per cent, andb) similarly, the deficit with the EU hit $17.59 billion, as imports ticked up 2.5per cent and exports collapsed 15.7per cent.Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies, said the worsening trade deficit with two of Trumpâ€™s main trade war targets could lead to more attacks from the president.â€œThese record deficits are likely both be a partial consequence of the ongoing trade/ tariff war and a likely catalyst for increase trade tensions between the US, EU and China,â€? McCarthy said in a note to clients.McCarthy also pointed out that the trade deficit with Canada increased to $3.15 billion, a 58per cent increase from the month before and the highest since January.Of particular note, exports of soybeans fell by $700 million in the month of July, a 16.2per cent drop. Soybeans are the largest US agricultural export, and China is by far the largest destination for the crop. China imposed tariffs on US soybeans in July, and the pre-tariff surge in soybean exports appears to be reversing. But soybean exports through the first seven months came above the same time period a year ago.The data show that while the tariffs may be having some marginal effect on exports, the surge in imports is mostly due to the internal strength of the US economy. The US consumer is in a healthy financial spot, especially compared to many other countries, and the strong US dollar makes exports cheaper.Add all of this up and you have a recipe for a growing deficits.Ian Shepherdson, the chief economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that given the variety of factors at work, the second quarterâ€™s decline in the trade deficit will most likely be erased in the current quarter.â€œThe trade deficit likely will be flat-to-higher over the next couple of months, reversing most or all of the second quarterâ€™s drop, which the President has cited as evidence of the success of his trade policies,â€? he said. â€œIt wasnâ€™t.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a trade war looms, one of Chinese President Xi Jinpingâ€™s biggest weapons could be boycotts of American brands by his countryâ€™s legion of consumers.But Xi would also be risking collateral damage at home: The China operations of all-American brands ranging from Coca-Cola Co. and McDonaldâ€™s Corp. to Walt Disney Co. are co-owned by state-backed Chinese firms.One of Cokeâ€™s main China partners is government-backed COFCO Corp.; Shanghai Disneyland is part owned by a local consortium, and McDonaldâ€™s franchisee in the country is controlled by state-backed conglomerate Citic Ltd. and private-equity firm Citic Capital Holdings.â€œThe perfect Stars-and-Stripes corporate victim doesnâ€™t exist,â€? said Tom Orlik, chief economist in Beijing with Bloomberg Economics. â€œThe number of big clean wins in terms of striking against the other guy -- without accidentally punching your own guy in the face -- is extremely small.â€?Even when Chinese companies donâ€™t have direct ownership links with U.S. brands, Orlik said, boycotts or other non-tariff retaliation would hit the local partners of those American companies.Early shots in the trade war are set to be fired on Friday, with the U.S. scheduled to impose tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese exports. Beijing has said it will place levies on an equal value of U.S. goods, a move that Trump said would lead to additional penalties. This week, the U.S. moved to block China Mobile Ltd. from entering its telecommunications market, citing national security risks.â€œBy now there is no backing out,â€? Pauline Loong, managing director at research firm Asia-Analytica in Hong Kong, said on Bloomberg Television on Monday.Unlike overt actions like tariffs, boycotts by Chinese consumers appear suddenly and usually follow angry rhetoric by government-controlled publications and social media. In earlier conflicts with foreign countries, Chinese citizens inflamed by nationalistic news coverage, boycotted high-profile international brands like Toyota Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co., hurting corporate profits and boosting Chinese leverage.Imports of Chinese goods into the U.S. totaled $505 billion in 2017 while China only imported $130 billion from the U.S., limiting Xiâ€™s ability to respond with tit-for-tat penalties. However, American companies sold $280 billion of goods and services in China last year through their local subsidiaries, according to Deutsche Bank AG. That creates a big target.â€œNo U.S. product sold in China, or U.S. company invested in China, can be considered safe from its retaliation,â€? said Yanmei Xie, a China policy analyst for Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing.Besides boycotts, Beijing could consider creating costly administrative bottlenecks for U.S. imports or impose punitive measures against U.S. companies operating in China, analysts at research firm TS Lombard wrote in a June 20 note.So far government-controlled media have said little on how consumers should respond to a trade war with the U.S., although an editorial in the Global Times highlighted anti-U.S. sentiment in Europe as well as calls by Canadians to boycott American goods because of Trumpâ€™s penalties on imported steel and aluminum. Xiâ€™s government last month said China would retaliate immediately and forcefully to U.S. tariffs.Prominent consumer brands like McDonaldâ€™s and KFC have in the past been easy targets, with thousands of restaurants across the country.But since anti-U.S. demonstrations in 2016 targeted them with calls for boycotts, the U.S. owners of both fast-food giants have sold their controlling interests in their Chinese operations.Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonaldâ€™s owns only 20 percent of its Chinese namesake, having sold the rest last July to state-backed conglomerate Citic Ltd. and other investors.Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum! Brands Inc. no longer owns the KFC and Pizza Hut businesses in China, having spun off Yum China Holdings Inc. in 2016. Meanwhile, in April 2017, Coca-Cola sold its China bottling assets to COFCO and Hong Kong-listed Swire Pacific Ltd.Consumers trying to punish Trump by staying away from Disneyâ€™s $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai would end up hurting Chinese companies because the American firm is just a minority shareholder there. A state-run consortium, Shanghai Shendi Group, owns 57 percent of the resort, which opened in 2016 and attracted more than 11 million visitors in its first year.So consumers looking to punish an American brand could unknowingly punish a Chinese one as well.That may be a price Xiâ€™s willing to pay, especially since heâ€™s not the only one facing the risk of collateral damage. Trumpâ€™s efforts to punish China will damage U.S. business, with its farmers losing if China finds other suppliers of commodities like soybeans. And not all American brands have Chinese partners, so Beijing could simply decide to single out some.If political ties deteriorate sharply, many Chinese looking to do their part probably wonâ€™t be too concerned about who owns what, according to Bruno Lannes, a Shanghai-based partner with consultancy Bain & Co.â€œIâ€™m not sure Chinese consumers have a real understanding of the ownership structure of companies that do business in China,â€? he said. â€œIf theyâ€™re told this is a U.S. company or a U.S. product, then they would accept that even if the majority share is owned by a Chinese company.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US President Donald Trump has announced he has reached an agreement with the European Union (EU) to move forward together toward a 'zero tariff' situation, thus avoiding a trade war , after meeting the president of the European Commission Trump on Wednesday said he had reached an agreement with the EU to work together toward a policy of 'zero' tariffs and trade barriers, adding 'we are starting the negotiation right now, but we know where it is going' and proclaiming 'a new phase' in US-EU trade relations, Efe news reported.Meanwhile, both Washington and Brussels will 'hold off on other tariffs' while the talks are under way, Juncker said.In a joint appearance before the press with Juncker, Trump said that the EU will begin importing soybeans from the US Midwest, as well as liquefied natural gas to 'diversity' its energy sources, in addition to reducing some industrial tariffs.The EC chief, meanwhile, hailed the trade agreement, which includes reducing tariffs by both parties and easing the bilateral frictions that had arisen in recent months.Juncker said that he had gone into his Oval Office meeting with Trump with both parties intending to reach an agreement.He also said that the pact establishes the 'resolution' of the US tariffs on European steel and aluminium that had sparked a trade brouhaha between Brussels and Washington, although neither Trump nor Juncker specified whether these would be immediately annulled.Minutes later, at a conference at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Juncker said that the agreement emphasised the 'special' nature of the alliance between the US and the EU going on to stress that trade between the two parties comprises half of all global commerce.Juncker's visit to Washington aroused great expectations after the exchange of accusations and the imposition of tariffs by Trump on European steel and aluminium, to which Brussels had responded with identical measures on assorted US products, including motorcycles and jeans.Trump has insisted in recent months on the need for the EU to agree to his demands to facilitate US access to the European market and has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 20 per cent on imports of European automobiles if the bloc did not make concessions to Washington.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Zach Howe, CTV EdmontonThe trade war between Canada and the U.S. is already affecting at least one local business that relies heavily on foreign imports to stay afloat.Boat dealership Marine Management Services, which has five western Canada location, including Shipwreck Marine in Edmonton, has prepared in anticipation of tariffs on American goods. The companyâ€™s director of operations, Dan Koziak, said theyâ€™ve cancelled all American orders as of Canada Day in an attempt to dodge the hefty increases.â€œWe brought in 150 boats, which we wouldnâ€™t have brought in this time of year to keep the prices low for our customers.â€?Justin Trudeauâ€™s government announced Friday that they will be matching Donald Trumpâ€™s tariffs dollar-for-dollar. Trudeau revealed his $16.6-billion list of American imports that will be affected by the retaliatory tariffs.Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said, â€œCanada has no choice but to retaliate with a measured, perfectly reciprocal, dollar-for-dollar response.â€?Freeland said the decision to strike back wasnâ€™t an easy one.â€œWe are acting very much in sorrow, not in anger,â€? she said.The U.S. imposed a 10 per cent surtax on aluminum and 25 per cent on steel which came into effect June 1. Canada has struck back with tariffs of their own, matching the aluminum and steel tariffs and imposing a 10 per cent increase on goods from alcohol to machinery and even condiments.Freeland said the federal government wanted to target products that could easily be sourced from Canadian or non-American suppliers and target Republican states that would be most affected by Canadian tariffs.The new surtaxes will hurt businesses and consumers on both sides of the border.Aluminum makes up 60 per cent of Shipwreck Marineâ€™s boats, and Koziak said a 10 per cent increase is substantial.The increase in prices will affect the manufacturers who then have to increase the prices for dealers and vendors who will then have to increase the prices for customers. Koziak said this will lead to customers not being able to afford the product and put jobs at risk.â€œNot only are [the dealers] susceptible to the tariffs for boats going from the U.S. to Canada, the manufacturers are susceptible to the tariffs on aluminum and steel that are going to the U.S,â€? Koziak said.â€œ[The tariffs] will absolutely increase prices to customers on boats, thereâ€™s no way around it.â€?The tariff showdown between both heads of state is a double-edged sword for manufacturers and vendors alike. Both sides of the equation will suffer from the increase and prices will have nowhere to go but up.â€œItâ€™s going to hurt our business. It will definitely hurt our business because anytime thereâ€™s an increase in prices of anything, customers will automatically back off.â€œThis is going to be a huge impact on the boating community,â€? he said.Eugene Beaulieu, a University of Calgary economics professor, doesnâ€™t believe there is a quick fix in this dispute.â€œThere isnâ€™t an easy solution here. I think Canada did do the right thing here, I think they had to stand firm and retaliate. I also think they were smart not to overreact and not take the very politically charged public debate thatâ€™s been happening over trade,â€? he explained.Beaulieu believes the trade war was initiated by Trump to seek political payoff but in the long run, it will harm some American firms.â€œThe truth of the matter is trade wars are costly to everyone. There are no winners in this at all, itâ€™s really a lose-lose situation,â€? said Beaulieu. â€œItâ€™s affecting two-way trade, itâ€™s affecting production, and itâ€™s affecting employment.â€?Koziak predicts a lot of products that are built using steel or aluminum wonâ€™t be an option for a lot of consumers if the trade war continues.â€œA $60,000 boat might go up to $70,000. It almost puts it out of reach for a lot of consumers.â€?With files from Angela Jung",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BEIJING â€“ Just hours after the United States introduced 25 percent trade tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, Beijing has retaliated with mirror measures against American imports.â€œAfter the United States introduced the new tariffs, Chinaâ€™s reciprocal measures also immediately took effect,â€? said the spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry Lu Kang. He did not specify the amount or types of the US goods that will be taxed by China.Chinaâ€™s commerce ministry earlier said the country has no choice but to fight back after the US â€œlaunched the largest trade war in economic history.â€? Beijing also accused Washington of breaching trade rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).â€œThese tariffs violate the WTO rules and represent a typical â€œtrade bullyâ€?, posing a grave threat to the security of global industry and value chains. Moreover, it will hamper global economic recovery and trigger global market turmoil while dealing a blow to many multinationals, enterprises and ordinary consumers,â€? said the ministry on Friday.It added that instead of â€œserving the interests of US companies and people, the move will prove to be counter-productive and damaging.â€?US tariffs of 25 percent apply to 818 Chinese imports worth $34 billion. They are the first stage in levies threatened by the Trump administration on a total of $450 billion worth of Chinese goods.US President Donald Trump told reporters on Thursday that US tariffs on an additional $16 billion in Chinese goods are set to take effect in two weeks. He added the US is ready to target an additional $200 billion, and then $300 billion more should Beijing retaliate.That would bring the total of targeted Chinese goods to potentially $550 billion which is more than the $506 billion in goods that China shipped to the US last year.Beijing earlier released a target list of $34 billion worth of imported US goods, including automobiles and agricultural products that also faced 25 percent tariffs.â€œChina promised to not fire the first shot, but to defend national core interests and the interests of the people it has no choice but to strike back as necessary,â€? said the ministry of commerce.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A trade war between the US and China has been officially kick-started, with the Trump administration beginning to impose the first 25% tariff wave on US$34 billion worth of Chinese products. This wave will be followed by levies on another US$16 billion worth of Chinese goods in two weeks.Meanwhile, China has inflicted the same import tariff rate of 25% on US$34 billion worth of 545 US import items. Previously, China had announced that it would fight back with retaliatory tariffs on US$50 billion worth of 659 US products.However, experts said the duelling tariff plans will help Vietnam lure more foreign direct investment (FDI) from China, where production and labour costs are increasing. Vietnam is offering enterprises and investors a minimum wage that is 59% of Chinaâ€™s and 70% of Thailandâ€™s.â€œUS companies, similar to companies from many other countries, are constantly adjusting their supply chains to stay competitive. It is possible that some companies will look at shifting production from China to Vietnam to avoid higher tariffs,â€? Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi, told VIR.According to a US-backed law firm specialised in providing consultancy for US investors in Vietnam, with this war, foreign firms in China, including US companies, will find it more difficult to stay competitive as China faces higher tariffs from the US.â€œThey will have to think about another market apart from China. However, it is not easy for them to immediately shift their production out of China, because China is a global manufacturing hub and has joined the value chains of many global firms,â€? a consultant told VIR. â€œInstead of moving the whole of their facilities out of China, these investors tend to choose to supplement their China-based facilities with low-cost input sourced from other markets like Vietnam, which currently has a large network of free trade agreements (FTAs). Vietnam remains attractive to US investors.â€?Lam Thi Quynh Anh, head of the Division for Domestic International Economic Integration under the Office of the Inter-agency Steering Committee for International Economic Integration, told VIR that with 12 signed FTAs, 10 of which have already taken effect, and four FTAs currently under negotiations, Vietnam will have FTA-based relations with nearly 100 partners in the worldâ€™s five largest market regions, namely Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe (both Eastern Europe and Western Europe), America (both North America and South America), and Asia-Pacific.â€œThus, FTAs-featuring tax slashes and market openings-will enable Vietnam to attract more FDI, including FDI from China, even if the US-China war become fiercer,â€? Quynh Anh said.At the Vietnam Business Forum held two weeks ago in Hanoi, an annual policy dialogue between business associations in Vietnam and the government, Dragon Capital executive chairman Dominic Scriven said that Vietnam remains an attractive market for foreign investment.â€œIn the first half of this year, foreign investors withdrew US$5.6 billion from the Thai market, US$3.7 billion from the Indonesian market, and US$1.6 billion from the Philippine market, but they poured US$1.5 billion in the Vietnamese market,â€? Scriven said. â€œThis means foreign capital flow is still pouring into Vietnam.â€?Sitkoff told VIR that any economic gains from the potential shift of foreign investors might be offset by losses that Vietnam could incur because China is an assembly point for parts from the rest of the region-including Vietnam-before the final products are shipped to the US.â€œIt is important to remember that President Trump is committed to fair and reciprocal trade with US trading partners. Vietnam has a very large and growing trade surplus with the US, and we need to see greater efforts to balance this trade flow,â€? Sitkoff said. â€œThat is why I urge the Vietnamese government to resolve market barriers and the challenges that US companies are facing here, including in automobiles, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, electronic payment systems, tax and customs issues, and trade facilitation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"byIt seems the US-China trade conflict, if not full scale trade war, is entering the phase of no return. Nothing will be as before in the economic and otherwise relations between the two largest economies of the world. Washington appears ready to push its cause to the end, while Beijing still pretends not to understand it. The Americans insist on their demands, which reach far beyond tariffs touching some structural pillars of the Chinese economy. The White House says itâ€™s about misappropriation of U.S. intellectual property and the industrial subsidies Beijing allegedly freely employs.But China has become what she is today by absorbing western technology and running a centrally planned economy, having made subsidies its very structural base. During the last years though, things have evolved in China and the functioning principles of the Chinese economy have dramatically changed. Beijing now promotes the idea of China being a market economy. This allegation can be adequately defended. The country has two giant capital markets, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, which by and large have substituted the role of central planning in regulating the use of the factors of production; capital, labor and nature.Markets in place of central planningThis observation aspires to take care of the key issue of how production of goods and services is organized and functions in the vast country. There are much stronger arguments though to defend the market economy status, in the distribution system of goods and services. Within China prices of goods and distribution channels are set and organized more or less in the same way as in the â€˜western capitalist worldâ€™, by demand and offer, expressed by billions of decisions taken by producers and consumers.Now if the White House wants to denounce the truly strong Beijing government interference in the structuring and functioning of the Chinese financial system, it has better look elsewhere for arguments. The latest meltdown of the western financial system in the crisis years of 2008-2010 was just stopped from destroying the real economy of major westerns countries by the use of some trillions of government dollars, euros and pound sterlings. Still today the western financial system doesnâ€™t fall apart because everybody knows that the government will intervene and save the bankrupt banks. If this is not government interference words have lost their meaning.Who is more market oriented?In reality the administration of practically all the major â€˜capitalistâ€™ western countries acts as the lender of last resort and the ultimate insurer of each entire financial system. In comparison, the Chinese system is actually more people friendly and democratic than the western arrangement which favors the banks and the bankers instead of producers. In contrast, the Chinese deal uses the banks as instruments to favor production and employment for the masses, not the bankers. Those simple arguments leave Trumpâ€™s â€˜America Fistâ€™ strategy, as a naked and unprovoked declaration of war against China.Back to the latest developments, last weekâ€™s the US-China trade talks ended without issuing a joint statement. The two days deliberations in Washington, involving mid level officials from the two sides, produced no results at all. Itâ€™s even more discouraging that no new meeting was set. This leaves the trade confrontation to what the White House plans for the next two months. Up to now the two sides have implemented tariffs on goods worth $50 billion for the otherâ€™s exports.Threatening all tradeThe US administration though under the orders of the President, is preparing a new mammoth package of tariffs on imported Chinese goods worth $200bn. In total the Chinese exports to the US amount to $500bn, leaving a surplus for Beijing of not less than $355bn. Last June the U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, on official visit to Beijing, failed to convince the Chinese to increase their imports of American soybeans and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Washingtonâ€™s rhetoric goes as far as threatening all the $500bn of Chinese exports to the US.Under these conditions, reliable commentators estimate that the Chino-American trade war is to escalate. The same sources observe though, that the two sides are careful not to let their trade differences spill over to other, more dangerous areas. Still the trade war has already touched the real economy, with China paying the larger cost. So far the impact is estimated at 0.3% â€“ 0.5% of the countryâ€™s GDP.America prospersOn the American side though the New York Stock Exchange breaks its capitalization records one after the other, in what is the longest Bull period for stock prices in history. For more than nine years now NYSE is jumping from one summit to another. Growth is also robust in the real US economy. Obviously then the Trump administration emboldened by the robust performance of the American economy is not going to ease up the pressure on China, at least not before the mid-term elections in the Congress this November. The Republican electoral base is thrilled with Trumpâ€™s tough stance towards China.Nevertheless, this may be the good outlook. The precarious prospect may be that the Trump administration will continue embarrassing the global trade relations and order throughout their four years term. In any case even if Trump is not to seek reelection in 2020, the â€˜America firstâ€™ narrative is there to stay. China and Germany are to feel the heat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is a tit-for-tat battle between the US and China. Credit: Getty ImagesAs president Donald Trump upped his trade war with China the shipping industry has been warned it would be redefined if the current trade battle became a global trade war.Speaking at the International Union of Marine Insuranceâ€™s (IUMIâ€™s) annual conference in Cape Town, Mats Persson, head of international trade at EY, warned vessels may be unable to access ports while seafarers may also be barred from operating in certain nations.Persson spelt out the worse-case scenarios as the United States continues to look at pursuing a protectionist agenda under the Trump Administration. The decision on Monday to impose new tariffs on USD200 billion of Chinese goods is set to prompt a response despite the Chinese government saying it has the fiscal tools to manage the impact.President Trump has also warned that if China retaliates he will look to impose tariffs on more Chinese imports in a trade war that is turning increasingly bitter.Looking back to Brexit, he said that the vote in the city of Sunderland in the northeast of England, which had 61% vote for Brexit, despite the fact that the city is home to a sizable Nissan motor manufacturing plant providing thousands of jobs exporting cars elsewhere in Europe, highlighted the real forces behind the current trade wars.â€œThe key drivers to the Brexit and current trade wars are not economic but social and political,â€? he explained. â€œTo understand them you have to dig deeper than the economic reasons.â€?He said that at present â€œwe are in a tit-for-tatâ€? trade battle where those countries affected by the US tariffs are reacting proportionallyâ€?. â€œAt present, we are firmly in the middle of a period of deep uncertainty.â€?The worst-case scenario is that if an all-out trade war erupts and the United States leaves the World Trade Organization, trading partners will look at more severe ways to retaliate to tariffs imposed by the United States. Such a scenario would cause a slump in global trade and negatively impact the economy in the maritime sector.â€œHowever, if Trump wants to take it to the next level will he have the support of his electorate if they start feeling the impact themselves?â€?For the maritime industry, Persson said that the impacts would be eclectic.â€œThese are likely to include delays at ports and more customs costs along with a rise in wages as it becomes more difficult to move goods across borders. Higher costs for fuel as oil prices rise may lead to increased operating costs, which would impact shipping if they were unable to raise freight rates to offset the costs. There may well also be pressure on supply chains to be localised with encouragement for local haulage, shipping, and logistics firms to be utilised.â€?However, there are some upsides.â€œIt is plausible that if China and the US would look for new regional trade alliances to bolster any impacts felt on their economy,â€? he explained.There may also be a new series of trade routes that would reflect a more localised supply chains with more opportunities.Contact Jon GuyAccess all of our IUMI 2018 content via our topic page",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The first shots in a potential trade war have been fired, the International Monetary Fund exclaimed in its latest World Economic Outlook last week. The US-China trade standoff certainly has investors worried, too â€“ and that fear is intensifying.In the latest fund manager survey carried out by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, 38% of investors said the trade war was the biggest tail risk, up from 30% in March.Thatâ€™s no surprise â€“ since peaking in late January, Hong Kongâ€™s Hang Seng has fallen almost 9%. US markets have slipped around 5-6%, too.The ructions began in early March, when US President Donald Trump announced plans to place tariffs of 25% on steel and other Chinese imports and 10% on aluminium. His counterpart Xi Jinping retaliated by imposing duties on up to $3 billion of US imports.The episode has continued to escalate, leading Maurice Obstfeld, the IMFâ€™s economic counsellor, to caution that the post-war trading system, which has â€œnurtured unprecedented growth in the world economyâ€? is now â€œin danger of being torn apartâ€?.But are investors right to be so concerned? Mike Bell, global market strategist at JPMorgan, says itâ€™s important to put the figures into perspective. The most aggressive numbers floated are 25% tax on up to $150 billion of goods. Thatâ€™s $37.5 billion.â€œItâ€™s very tricky for us to conceptualise whatâ€™s going on when there are numbers in the billions range being thrown around,â€? Bell notes. In fact, $37.5 billion is 0.3% of Chinaâ€™s GDP in 2017 and 0.2% of the USâ€™s.In total, exports to China account for just 0.7% of US GDP; exports from China to the US is around 3.6% of Chinaâ€™s GDP. â€œThat does a good job in framing how important this trade discussion is,â€? Bell adds.â€œItâ€™s not that itâ€™s irrelevant; itâ€™s just that the numbers really arenâ€™t big enough to warrant the sort of panic in markets that weâ€™ve seen over the last month or two.â€?Both Bell and Chetan Sehgal, manager of Templeton Emerging Markets (TEM), global trade remains robust, and is likely to continue to do so.How Will A Trade War Impact China?As for the impact on China, Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia, thinks it will be negligible. â€œWhat people have forgotten is that China is no longer an export-led economy,â€? he explains.China has successfully transitioned from being an export-led economy to a service-led economy. A decade ago, net exports were equal to 9% of Chinese GDP. Last year, it was equal to 2%. And even within that, exports to other emerging market nations has grown.Rothman says Trump may have had more success if he had joined forces with the EU and Japan. â€œThat would have been a bloc that was taking 45% of Chinaâ€™s exports â€“ that would have really put some pressure on China.â€?Instead, the unilateral approach heâ€™s taking means only 19% of Chinaâ€™s exports are at threat. â€œA trade war will hurt China, but not as much as people think,â€? Rothman continues.Actually, the two countries that would be most affected are the USâ€™s two biggest trading partners, Mexico and Canada. With the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) currently being re-negotiated, too, Bell thinks the US-China spat is â€œpotentially distractingâ€?.The biggest risk is that people focus too much on the US-China discussion and donâ€™t focus enough on what is actually the major trade relationship that exists, he adds.How Will A Trade War Impact The US?Rothman think it will have more of an impact on the US, though more politically than anything. He says that while Trump is attempting to inflict maximum economic damage on China, China is trying to inflict maximum political damage on Trump.â€œItâ€™s actually pretty clever. Theyâ€™re going after the parts of the US economy that might not be the biggest parts but are the parts that can bring political pressure to bear.â€?Take soy beans, one of the products on Chinaâ€™s list of retaliatory tariffs. China imports about 60% of globally traded soy beans. The majority of US farmersâ€™ soy bean crops go to China. Most soy beans are grown in places that vote for Trump.Chinaâ€™s focus now is on riling the soy bean and wheat farmers â€“ and itâ€™s working. The price of both is down 3.4% and 5.45 respectively in the past seven weeks. â€œSoy bean and wheat farmers are up in arms and theyâ€™re calling their congressmen and saying â€˜you gotta talk Trump out of thisâ€™,â€? says Rothman.Story Continues",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Trump Dials Up the Trade War to 11The Trump administrationâ€™s surprise decision to invoke national security concerns to justify hefty new tariffs on automobile imports promises to further sour relations with major trading partners, undermine the global trading system that drives economic growth â€” and ultimately weaken, not strengthen, U.S. national security.As it did this year to curb imports of steel and aluminum, the Trump administration is dusting off 1960s-era legislation to potentially put in place protections for the U.S. auto industry. The Commerce Department said late Wednesday that itâ€™s beginning an investigation into the so-called national security implications of U.S. imports of cars and car parts; media reports suggest that the administration may be mulling tariffs of as much as 25 percent on imported goods.Justifying protective tariffs by arguing that steel imports represented a threat to national security was already a stretch and opened the United States to countertariffs and international legal actions. Using the national security argument to try to protect domestic manufacturers of cars and light trucks bends the legislation out of all recognition, trade experts say.â€œItâ€™s not at all clear that this does anything to enhance national security. We donâ€™t drive Ford Escorts into battle,â€? says Phil Levy, an economic expert at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a former George W. Bush administration official.The Trump administration takes an expansive view of what national security means. In announcing the steel tariffs, officials argued that economic strength, including a vibrant metals sector, was essentially synonymous with national security. For the auto measures, the administration is adopting similar language. Commerce said it is looking into whether automobile â€œimports are weakening our internal economy and may impair the national security.â€?Major trading partners arenâ€™t buying it. â€œWe believe that there is no justification for the United States to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum on grounds of national security. Invoking national security would be even more far-fetched in the case of the car industry,â€? a spokesperson for the European Commission says. European Commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen suggested Thursday that any new auto tariffs â€œobviously would be against the World Trade Organizationâ€? rules.Other big trading partners, such as Canada and Mexico, are also trying to figure out what the new trade threats mean. Both countries have free trade with the United States thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement, and it isnâ€™t clear if any new tariffs would automatically apply to exports from those markets or not. Asian trading partners including Japan and South Korea, both of which were earlier hit with tariffs on steel exports, also reacted negatively; Japanese Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko called the announcement â€œextremely regrettableâ€? while South Korean officials huddled to discuss possible countermeasures.What the new round of tariffs almost certainly wonâ€™t do is strengthen national security â€” especially amid the war of words with Europe over the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, coupled with Thursdayâ€™s decision by President Donald Trump to call off a planned June 12 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a cancellation that reportedly blindsided allies in Seoul and Tokyo.Even though the United States and South Korea reached a deal to avoid steel tariffs, there is still confusion in Seoul over what limits will ultimately be placed on South Korean steel exports, Levy says. That lingering bad blood â€” plus the combination of threatened auto tariffs on a booming sector for both Japan and South Korea and the seeming implosion of the North Korean peace talks â€” threatens to weaken the U.S. position in Asia.â€œSo much of what we call U.S. security relies on having allies who stick with us, and who we stick with, irrespective of irritants like trade policy,â€? says Benn Steil, the director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. But the Trump administration doesnâ€™t seem to believe that, he says, instead viewing other countries as transactional counterparts or outright enemies.And itâ€™s not even clear why the Trump administration is considering protective tariffs for the domestic auto industry, which has been going gangbusters for the last three years and whose switch to producing more trucks and sport utility vehicles is driving huge sales numbers.It could be, like the steel tariffs or policies meant to bring back coal, a political sop ahead of crucial midterm elections to parts of the country that voted for Trump in 2016.â€œMaybe itâ€™s just domestic politics â€” before midterms, being able to say to the Rust Belt, â€˜Look at what Iâ€™m doing to protect the auto industry,â€™â€? says Emily Blanchard, a trade policy expert at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.Another possibility is that Trump wants to use the threat of auto tariffs to force Mexico and Canada to make concessions on NAFTA. The slowly progressing talks on the regional trade deal have been hung up over rules for auto manufacturing, and Trump on Wednesday called both countries â€œspoiledâ€? and hard to deal with on trade.Another theory is that the Trump administration wants to put serious teeth into its demand that more car parts be made in the United States. Under existing trade rules, carmakers could shrug off symbolic tariffs if they used non-U.S. parts, but slapping a hefty tariff on foreign auto parts would cause serious pain â€” and might force all parties together to reach a deal on a new NAFTA.More broadly, though, itâ€™s unclear why threatening tariffs would make Canada or Mexico any more eager to make politically painful concessions to renew a free trade deal that in theory should already shield them from tariffs.Another possibility is that the administration is trying to boost the competitiveness of the U.S. auto sector. â€œAutomobile manufacturing has long been a significant source of American technological innovation,â€? the Commerce Department said, noting that the share of imported cars has risen from about one-third to one-half of the U.S. market in the last 20 years. The administration stressed its desire to foster innovation in autonomous vehicles, electric cars, and advanced materials.But the stringent fuel economy standards put in place by the Obama administration â€” currently under threat from the Trump administration â€” have already been driving U.S. automakers to make huge advances in fuel efficiency, electric cars, and advanced, lightweight materials. Academic research suggests that automotive innovation is spurred even further by those tough fuel economy standards.Indeed, while U.S.-based automakers havenâ€™t been asking for protective tariffs, this month they pleaded with the administration not to scrap the tougher Obama mileage standards, as Trump intends to, warning that such a move could â€œdisrupt a period of rapid innovation in the auto industry.â€?A final possibility is that â€œAmerica Firstâ€? officials in the administration are simply taking aim at the entire global trading architecture. One of its pillars is a rules-based order, where countries canâ€™t just slap tariffs on imports on specious grounds.â€œItâ€™s so transparently protectionist, and the national security justification is so weak. Itâ€™s a way of saying, â€˜Anybody can do anything they want,â€™â€? Levy says.The administration already took one swipe at that trading order with the steel tariffs, but the system didnâ€™t totter or break. Most countries won some sort of exemption, and the WTO hasnâ€™t had to grapple with any formal challenges yet.â€œIf they were seeking to blow up the global trading rules, then national security tariffs on cars are the way to do it. If cars are national security, then whatâ€™s not?â€? Blanchard says. Such a move risks a cascade of similar protectionist measures around the globe, especially in agriculture, which is politically sensitive almost everywhere.Ultimately, the Trump administrationâ€™s unilateral and uncompromising approach to its major trade and security partners â€” on issues including European compliance with Iran sanctions and gratuitous trade wars â€” risks making it that much harder to summon international support for U.S. efforts to tackle real problems, such as nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea.â€œThe United States is starting to get treated like a crazy wild-haired guy waving a bag full of newspapers in the street,â€? Levy of the Chicago Council says. â€œPeople cross the street to avoid him â€” itâ€™s not somebody they want to deal with.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"President Donald Trumpâ€™s tit-for-tat trade war with China appears to have caused a significant slump in Chinese visitors to the United States that could cost the American tourism sector dearly this year â€“ according to the latest findings from ForwardKeys which predicts future travel patterns by analysing 17 million booking transactions a day.Weekly bookings from China to the US were up 2% from the last week of February (after the Chinese New Year holiday) to March 23 when the first tariffs took effect. Since then, ForwardKeysâ€™ data shows the year-on-year figure to August is down by 8.4%, falling further as new rounds of tariffs have been announced. The negative impact on the Chinese currency, which has fallen 7.5% against the US dollar since tariffs were introduced â€“ meaning touristsâ€™ money buys less â€“ and warnings from Beijing about US travel security risks, have likely further influenced the trend.ForwardKeysâ€™ data reveals that for the rest of the year, Chinese outbound bookings to the US are 9.6% behind where they were at the same time last year, whereas Chinese outbound bookings worldwide are ahead by 5.5%. This pattern of growth worldwide but slowdown to the US is consistent in every month except October. A general setback in October is due to this yearâ€™s Mid-Autumn festival falling at the end of September, which draws departures at the start of the busy National Day Golden Week holiday into September from October.The biggest impact has been on bookings for group travel (six or more passengers) from China to the US, currently behind for the rest of 2018 by 34.4% compared to last year. Bookings by free independent travellers (FIT) are behind 3.9%, with leisure travel being worse affected than travel for business or travel to visit friends and relatives.By way of a benchmark, Chinese bookings for travel to Canada were up 4.8% to the end of July and are currently ahead 8.0% for August to December.Tourism is big business. The United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) puts total spending by Chinese tourists abroad at US$ 258 billion in 2017. The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) reports that the value of tourism to the US from international visitors amounted to $200.7 billion in 2017, 8.6% of total exports.ForwardKeys CEO and co-founder, Olivier Jager, said: â€œOur findings strongly suggest that President Trumpâ€™s trade war has had a significant impact on Chinese tourism to the US. Looking at the year to date, we see a setback in Chinese tourism arrivals of just under 5%. If that continues to the end of the year, we estimate that the cost to the US economy will be north of US$ Â½ billion in 2018. Chinese spending in this sector is significant â€“ it amounts to the largest category of US services exports to China. It is unquestionable that the Chinese appetite for visiting the USA is diminishing, and that is bound to worry the US travel industry.â€?Related ArticleClick here to post your own story!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Please enable Javascript to watch this videoSALT LAKE CITY -- The minister of the Chinese embassy in the United States met with political leaders in Utah to discuss ways to deepen relationships and collaborate, even as tariffs and trade wars have the potential to damage the state's economy.Minister Xu Xueyuan met behind closed doors with members of the Utah State Legislature on Tuesday and she will meet with Gov. Gary Herbert on Wednesday. Lawmakers who attended the meeting told FOX 13 they discussed a booming tourism industry (with thousands of Chinese visitors to Utah annually), immersion programs where children in Utah schools learn Mandarin and, of course, trade.'Utah has a relationship with China. Weâ€™ve had a longstanding relationship,' said Senate Majority Whip Stuart Adams, R-Layton, as he left the meeting. 'Itâ€™s always great to have good friends from China come visit Utah.'Minister Xu met with reporters following her meeting with lawmakers and spoke of the importance of trade.'If a war erupts, whether it is hot or cold, it will hurt everybody,' she said. 'There won't be a winner to this war. There will only be losers.'She also spoke of the importance of a peaceful and positive relationship between the two nations.'I think a China-U.S. relationship has a big potential if it is handled properly,' she said.China is one of the state's biggest trading partners, Sen. Adams said. Recent tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, and retaliatory tariffs imposed by China, have threatened the state's economy. The Utah Dept. of Agriculture and Food estimates the total export impact from products ranging from pork and beef to cheese and other dairy is around $77 million.'We do have a kind of relationship or dialogue with this presidential administration,' said House Speaker Greg Hughes, R-Draper, who attended the meeting.Despite the rhetoric between Washington, D.C. and Beijing, Speaker Hughes said he was hopeful for new deals.'We have this inland port discussion weâ€™re having. If we can discuss ways our relationship can be stronger, we can be a best practice or example that other states can look at, as well as our federal government,' he said.Gov. Herbert's office said he also anticipated his meeting with Minister Xu to discuss trade as well as other ways Utah can collaborate with China.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In what looks to us like confirmation that the US has officially kicked the can down the road, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that China and the US were putting a trade war â€œon holdâ€? as the two sides work to hammer out a comprehensive trade agreement that will be acceptable to both sides.Mnuchin, who was in Beijing last week for trade talks with top Chinese officials, emphasized that Trump isnâ€™t giving up on holding China accountable â€“ the process is just taking longer than some had hoped.â€œRight now Chris weâ€™re going to put the trade war on holdâ€¦we made very meaningful progress and we agreed on a framework. The framework includes their agreement to substantially reduce the trade deficit by increasing their purchases of goods,â€? Mnuchin said, adding the two sides have agreed to numerical targets but the he didnâ€™t want to disclose them. â€œWeâ€™re putting the trade war on hold, right now, we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to executive the framework,â€? Mnuchin said.Mnuchinâ€™s comments come after China and the US on Saturday released a joint statement in which China proposed to â€œsignificantly increase purchasesâ€? of US goods.Moving on to the subject of ZTE, which President Trump said heâ€™d work to get ZTE â€œback into businessâ€? at the request of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Mnuchin said that â€œPresident Xi asked President Trumpâ€? to look into the situation at the Chinese telecoms giant, which isnâ€™t a surprise, he said. Still, Mnuchin insisted that Trump wants us to be â€œvery toughâ€? on ZTE.â€œThe president wants us to be very tough on ZTE. And all he did was ask the secretary to look into this,â€? Mnuchin said, referring to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.Of course, while â€œno trade war with Chinaâ€? is the headline that the Trump administration wants investors to focus on, the real news is that there might not be a Nafta deal until next year as Mnuchin says weâ€™re still â€œfar apartâ€? on Nafta .Mnuchin added that Trump is more concerned with striking a good deal on Nafta than rushing something through this year.â€œThe president is more determined to have a good deal than heâ€™s worried about any deadlineâ€¦So, whether we pass it in this Congress or we pass it in the new Congress, the president is determined that we renegotiate NAFTA.â€œStill, that doesnâ€™t mean Trump wonâ€™t follow through on threats to withdraw from the pact or take other action, if he decides thatâ€™s the best option, Mnuchin indicated.â€œHe has all his alternatives. Iâ€™m just saying right now weâ€™re focused on negotiating a good deal and weâ€™re not focused on specific deadlines,â€?Mnuchin said. â€œWeâ€™re still far apart, but weâ€™re working every day to renegotiate this agreement.â€?The Trump administration blew a Thursday deadline set by House Speaker Paul Ryan for finishing the agreement. Ryan had said the Office of the US Trade Representative would need to wrap up negotiations by May 17 in order for Congress to vote on it this year because of various statutorily mandated notification and consultation periods involved in the consideration of trade deals. However, Ryan later said there might be some â€œwiggle roomâ€?, hinting at a two-week extension of Congressâ€™s Nafta deadline.That represents a significant de-escalation from when the US had threatened to slap $150 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports to punish Beijing for violating American intellectual property. China has vowed to retaliate by slapping tariffs on everything from US soybeans to airplanes. Yet a meeting between Vice Premier Liu He and President Trump in Washington, as well as the meeting between Mnuchin and other US officials with senior Chinese officials in Beijing, has significantly dampened tensions as the US has likely realized that it canâ€™t just strong-arm China into doing what it wants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The United States announced on Tuesday that it will begin imposing 25 percent duties on an additional US$16bn worth of Chinese imports from August 23.According to a statement by the US Trade Representative Office, the tariffs will target 279 Chinese products (PDF), including motorcycles, speedometers and antennas - down from 284 items on the initial list, which was proposed on June 15.Among the products removed from the initial sanctions were shipping containers, which are almost exclusively made in China. Industrial sawing equipment was also removed.This is the second time the US has levied tariffs on Chinese goods.US President Donald Trump's administration announced plans to impose tariffs on US$50bn worth of Chinese goods in May, with initial tariffs worth US$34bn taking effect on July 6.China, in turn, has vowed to match Trump's actions with duties pertaining to the equivalent amount of US products.Washington has accused Beijing of unfair trade practices, with Trump vowing to reduce the United States' trade deficit with Beijing. China, on the other hand, argues that the tariffs violate World Trade Organization rules and merely serve to harm both countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"China and the United States imposed new tariff hikes on each otherâ€™s goods Monday and Beijing accused Washington of bullying, giving no sign of compromise in an intensifying battle over technology that is weighing on global economic growth.U.S. regulators went ahead with a planned 10 per cent tax on a $200 billion list of 5,745 Chinese imports including bicycles and furniture. Chinaâ€™s customs agency said it responded at noon by beginning to collect taxes of five or 10 per cent on a $60 billion list of 5,207 American goods, from honey to industrial chemicals.WATCH: What is a trade war? How do tariffs work?The conflict stems from U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s complaints Beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.American officials say Chinese plans for the state-led development of global competitors in robotics and other technologies violate its market-opening obligations and might erode U.S. industrial leadership.Chinaâ€™s leaders offered to narrow their politically sensitive, multibillion-dollar trade surplus with the United States by purchasing more natural gas and other American exports. But they have rejected pressure to change industry plans the communist leadership sees as a path to prosperity and global influence.WATCH: Trump defiant on tariffs as China levies $60B in tariffs on U.S. goodsMondayâ€™s tariff hike follows a report by The Wall Street Journal that Chinese officials pulled out of a meeting to discuss possible talks proposed by Washington. The Chinese government had given no public indication whether it would accept the invitation.Envoys last met Aug. 22 in Washington but reported no progress.With no settlement in sight, forecasters say the conflict between the two biggest economies could trim global growth through 2020.On Monday, the ratings agency Fitch cut its forecasts for next yearâ€™s Chinese and global economic growth by 0.1 percentage points to 6.1 per cent and 3.1 per cent, respectively.â€œThe trade war is now a reality,â€? said Fitchâ€™s chief economist, Brian Coulton, in a report. â€œThe downside risks to our global growth forecasts have also increased.â€?READ MORE: China hoping to secure free-trade agreement with Canada amid rising tensions with U.S.Earlier, the two sides imposed 25 per cent penalties on $34 billion of each otherâ€™s goods in July and another $16 billion in August. Business groups say American companies also report Chinese regulators are starting to disrupt their operations through slower customs clearance and more environmental and other inspections.The first American tariffs targeted goods Washington said benefit from improper Chinese industrial policies. American regulators tried to limit the public impact by focusing on industrial machinery and components, but the latest $200 billion list includes bicycles, wooden furniture and other consumer goods.Chinese regulators have tried to cushion the blow on their own economy by targeting American goods such as soybeans, natural gas, fruit, whisky and automobiles that are available from Europe, Latin America and other Asian countries.WATCH: President Trump levels new multi-billion dollar tariff on ChinaTrump threatened last week to add $267 billion in Chinese imports to the target list if Beijing retaliated for the latest U.S. taxes. That would cover nearly everything China sells to the United States.On Monday, the Chinese government accused the Trump administration in a report of â€œtrade bullyismâ€? and of preaching â€œeconomic hegemony.â€?The toughly worded report said Beijing wants a â€œreasonable solutionâ€? but gave no indication of possible concessions.It affirmed Chinaâ€™s stance that it is a developing country, a claim that rankles Washington, Europe and other trading partners.They point to Chinaâ€™s status as a major manufacturer and a growing competitor in smartphones and other technology. They say Beijing is no longer entitled to concessions it was granted when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, such as the right to limit access to its finance, energy and other markets.READ MORE: China focuses on sustained growth as its economy slowsChinese leaders have tried without success to recruit as allies German, France, South Korea and other trading partners that echo U.S. complaints about Chinese market barriers and industry plans but criticize Trumpâ€™s approach.The Trump administration has â€œhas brazenly preached unilateralism, protectionism and economic hegemony, making false accusations against many countries and regions, particularly China, intimidating other countries through economic measures such as imposing tariffs, and attempting to impose its own interests on China through extreme pressure,â€? the official Xinhua News Agency said.Chinese leaders have announced changes this year including tariff cuts and plans to end ownership limits in their auto industry. But businesspeople who have met senior planners say they express no willingness even to discuss changes to technology development plans.As the fight intensifies, China is running out of U.S. imports for retaliation.Imports of American goods last year totalled $153.9 billion while the United States bought Chinese goods worth $429.8 billion, according to Chinese customs data. Mondayâ€™s increase leaves Beijing with about $40 billion of goods for penalties while Washington has almost $200 billion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Pin 5 SharesJeffrey Kucik, University of ArizonaPresident Donald Trump justifies tariffs on imports by arguing that â€œunfair trade policiesâ€? have harmed American workers. This has led to a trade war in which the U.S. and China have placed tit-for-tat tariffs on each otherâ€™s products.Most recently, China said itâ€™s ready to slap tariffs on US$60 billion in U.S. imports if Trump goes ahead with his threat to tax another $200 billion of Chinese goods.Since the president claims to be acting on behalf of working-class Americans, itâ€™s fair to ask: How do tariffs actually affect them?Scholars of international political economy, such as myself, recognize that trade hasnâ€™t always been good for poorer Americans. However, the economic fundamentals are clear: Tariffs make things worse.Free trade and tariffsThe erosion of American manufacturing became a hot-button issue during the 2016 election. And for good reason. Total employment in manufacturing has fallen by 25 percent since 2001, putting about 4.5 million workers out of a job.Members of both parties now agree that free trade is largely to blame for this decline. Off-shoring and â€œbadâ€? trade deals are cited as evidence that trade no longer serves Americaâ€™s interests.Donâ€™t like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad freeThe Trump administrationâ€™s solution is tariffs. In recent months, entry barriers have been erected, first to protect solar panels and washing machines in January and then steel and aluminum in March.Although heâ€™s fighting these trade battles with many partners, including Canada and Europe, most of Trumpâ€™s attention is directed toward China. He claims that China manipulates its currency, fails to protect intellectual property and stunts economic innovation. Sweeping tariffs â€“ beginning with a 25 percent increase on $34 billion of Chinese imports â€“ are an attempt to combat those issues.Trump has said another $200 billion in tariffs are ready to go â€“ and that heâ€™s even prepared to tax everything China sends to the U.S.Unfortunately, there are several reasons to think that tariffs will only harm those Trump wants to protect.Tariffs raise prices for consumersThe purpose of a tariff is to help domestic companies.Tariffs are a tax on imports. As taxes go up, so do the prices of foreign goods. Consider the metal tariffs. Foreign imports of steel and aluminum became more expensive overnight â€“ to the tune of 25 and 10 percent, respectively. Higher prices drive down consumption of foreign goods while bolstering demand for domestic equivalents.Unfortunately, protecting a few narrow industries can generate much broader costs. Not least, consumers now have to pay more for everyday goods.Trumpâ€™s tariffs on Chinese imports go far beyond steel and aluminum and affect a wide variety of basic products, from consumer electronics to shoes and apparel.Thatâ€™s not a problem for higher earners who can absorb the extra costs. But, for those with more limited incomes, who are especially vulnerable to tariff increases, price hikes can quickly gobble up take-home pay.Basic necessities such as food and clothing make up a larger share of working-class household expenditures when compared to higher-income families. And most of those products are imported. Foreign producers make up an overwhelming percentage of sales of many basic goods, such as shoes. In fact, one manufacturing industry group reports that 80 percent of Walmartâ€™s suppliers are housed across the Pacific.Donâ€™t like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad freeOne 2017 paper estimated that a 10 percent across-the-board increase in tariffs on imported goods would cost the poorest 20 percent of earners $300 a year.Thatâ€™s a meaningful chunk of the less than $13,000 earned by the poorest U.S. households in 2015. Moreover, Trumpâ€™s first round of tariffs werenâ€™t the 10 percent used in the study. They are 25 percent.And the president isnâ€™t stopping there. While the White House initially threatened a 10 percent tariff increase on the next $200 billion of goods heâ€™s targeting, officials are reportedly considering raising that to 25 percent.Taken together, this means the real impact of tariffs on household incomes could be more than double earlier estimates.Tariffs raise prices for companiesTariffs also have negative consequences for American producers that rely on foreign inputs.The metals tariffs, for example, mean that manufacturers of cars, aircraft and tractors all have to pay more to produce their goods. Hence the vocal opposition to Trump from companies such as Ford and Boeing. Their costs are now going up, endangering their competitiveness.What this also means is that tariffs put jobs at risk â€“ far more than they help protect.Trumpâ€™s recent steel and aluminum tariffs were said to benefit as many as 400,000 workers. But 10 times as many workers â€“ 4.6 million â€“ are employed in industries that rely on metals as a core input.The comparison is even starker for solar panels. About 2,000 workers directly manufacture solar panels in the United States. However, 260,000 work in related industries such as installation and maintenance. Those workers depend on a thriving solar market â€“ a market that has stagnated since the tariffs.If one wants to count jobs, the numbers simply donâ€™t add up to a net benefit for the U.S. economy.Tariffs make it harder to do business abroadFinally, trade protectionism is a two-way street.Beijing wasted no time in responding to Trumpâ€™s tariffs, announcing duties of 15 percent to 25 percent on nearly $45 billion of U.S. exports to China, mostly agricultural products. And more will be coming if the war escalates, with some of the highest tariffs being put on food products.Donâ€™t like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad freeOf course, targeting agrarian goods is a strategic decision. Agriculture is one of the United Statesâ€™ few remaining export-oriented sectors. And, since China is the second-largest buyer of U.S. agricultural exports, farmers are particularly vulnerable to retaliation. If a country wants to hit the U.S. economy where it hurts, target agriculture.China did exactly that, hitting U.S. producers of soybeans, corn, poultry and beef particularly hard. As a result, agricultural workers will find it more difficult to make a living in a sector where incomes have historically lagged behind the national average of all industries.And poorer areas of the country will be harder hit than others. Three of the states that are the most vulnerable to retaliation â€“ Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina â€“ all have per capita incomes far below the national average.Donâ€™t like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad freeThat means that poorer households, in poorer states, face the greatest threat if export-dependent agricultural companies canâ€™t do business with one of their most important trade partners.The bigger pictureThis is not to say that removing all trade barriers and opening the U.S. economy to all comers will solve the problems facing working-class and poorer Americans.No one argues that trade is cost-free. Some industries inevitably contract due to foreign competition. And workers in those industries arenâ€™t easily employed in the new jobs that are created.But thereâ€™s something else that costs jobs, too: trade wars.As tensions continue to escalate, poorer households, already struggling to keep up , will face additional downward pressure on their incomes. Thatâ€™s bad news for the workers whom Trump promised to help.Jeffrey Kucik, Assistant Professor of Political Science, University of ArizonaThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

"Donald Trump was accused of firing the starting pistol on an international trade war, as the US administration slapped swingeing new tariffs on EU steel imports.The 25% levy on steel, along with a 10% tariff on aluminium, will come into effect on Friday with the expiry of an exemption first granted to the EU, Mexico and Canada by Mr Trump in March.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker denounced the move as â€œprotectionism pure and simpleâ€?, while a UK Government spokesman described it as â€œdeeply disappointingâ€?.The CBI warned the move would â€œdamage prosperity on both sides of the Atlanticâ€?. Industry body UK Steel said that, with exports to America worth half a billion dollars a year, producers in Britain would be â€œhit hardâ€?.US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross (centre) announced the new tariffs after talks in Paris (AP Photo/Francois Mori)Trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said that throughout negotiations stretching over the past months, the US had tried to use the threat of trade restrictions â€œas leverage to obtain concessions from the EUâ€?.â€œThis is not the way we do business, and certainly not between long-standing partners, friends and allies,â€? she said.Speaking from Paris, US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross said that talks with the EU had made â€œsome progressâ€?, but not enough to extend the exemption. He stressed that Washington was â€œwilling and indeed eager to have further discussionsâ€?.AdvertisingA UK Government spokesman said that as close allies of the US, Britain and other EU states should be â€œpermanently and fully exempted from the American measures on steel and aluminiumâ€?.â€œWe have made clear to the US Government at the highest levels the importance of UK steel and aluminium to its businesses and defence projects,â€? said the spokesman.â€œWe will continue to work closely with the EU and US administration to achieve a permanent exemption and to ensure that UK workers are protected and safeguarded.â€?AdvertisingUK Steel director Gareth Stace said: â€œPresident Trump had already loaded the gun and today we now know that the US administration has unfortunately fired it and potentially started a damaging trade war.â€?The new tariffs will cause â€œdamage not only to the UK steel sector, but also the US economyâ€?, said Mr Stace, adding: â€œWith some half billion dollars of steel exported from the UK to US last year, UK steel producers are going to be hit hard.â€?The CBIâ€™s international director Ben Digby said: â€œThe Presidentâ€™s measures are deeply concerning for firms in the UK, for close trading partners and across supply chains.â€œThere are no winners in a trade war, which will damage prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. These tariffs could lead to a protectionist domino effect, damaging firms, employees and consumers in the US, UK and many other trading partners.â€?Labour spokeswoman on steel Gill Furniss described the tariff announcement as â€œa catastrophic blow to the sector and steelworkers across the countryâ€?.â€œTheresa May and her Government have approached the ongoing crisis with utter complacency and have proved too feeble to stand up to Trump when it was most needed,â€? said the Sheffield Brightside MP.â€œThey have let our steelworkers down.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Global trade relations are currently moving in opposite directions.While US President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration is trying to impose new restrictions on its trade with the rest of the world â€” especially its main partners such as the EU, China and Japan â€” there are other influential powers with great leverage in trade ties seeking a further liberalisation.The US has recently levied tariffs on imports from China, the EU, Canada and many others, which would have an effect on up to $500 billion (Dh1.83 trillion) of its trade with China alone.Thus, Trump has left other partners facing a difficult choice, either full liberalisation of trade or levying of equal tariffs by all parties.During a meeting with the European Commission president last week, Trump said he would work with Jean-Claude Juncker to work to reduce trade barriers to zero on industrial goods, with the exception of cars. Juncker on his part said, â€œThe US and EU will refrain from imposing any more tariffs during their trade negotiations.â€?This means reaching no final agreement, in light of the French President Emmanuel Macronâ€™s immediate rejection of the Trump-Juncker agreement. This despite the trade exchange between the EU and the US exceeding $1 trillion dollars annually.On the other hand, the European Union and Japan signed a free-trade agreement in mid-July and which will come into force in 2019. It will be the worldâ€™s largest free trade agreement and cover one-third of the global economy and 600 million people. It in turn deals a blow to the protectionist policy adopted by the US president.However, it is still unknown which side will have scale in its favour. The US is struggling alone against powers such as China, the EU and Japan, which practically constitutes a trade bloc against US tariffs that Trump believes is a legitimate right similar to the tariffs imposed on his countryâ€™s exports by the other three.It goes without saying that none of the major powers intends to enter a trade war with the largest economic power, whose market represents a vital outlet for their exports. At the same time, the conditions set by Trump cannot be accepted as they pose a trade and economic challenge to the others and are not welcome even within the US itself, prompting the US administration to allocate $12 billion in the form of subsidies to American farmers.The global trade situation as a whole is in a state of uncertainty, as there are no indications of any understandings on the disputes. This would cause serious damage to global growth as a whole.If the US has scale in its favour, it would become the undisputed trading power and once again regain control over trade relations that have been shaken by the emergence of China and the European Union as powers that can influence trends.Meanwhile, if matters head the other way and a European-Chinese-Japanese alliance is formed, the US economy would be severely affected and countermeasures would be taken as a result. Both cases would aggravate a trade war that has already entered into force.There remains slim prospect of compromises to meet halfway and save the world from the dire consequences. It is in fact being sought by the EU, China and Japan, but face many complications on the US side.â€” Dr Mohammad Al Asoomi is a UAE economic expert and specialist in economic and social development in the UAE and the GCC countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sofia, Bulgaria: The European Union warned about the costs of a trans-Atlantic trade war while bracing for one to erupt after the US signalled it will reject the blocâ€™s demand for an unconditional waiver from metals-import tariffs.â€œA trade war is a losing game for everybody,â€? Belgian Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt told reporters in Sofia, Bulgaria, on Saturday. â€œWe should be very careful about this, we should stay cool when weâ€™re thinking about reactions but the basic point is that nobody wins in a trade war so we try to avoid it at all costs,â€? he said ahead of a meeting with his peers from the worldâ€™s largest trading bloc.Donald Trumpâ€™s administration is asking Europe, Canada and other allies to accept quotas in exchange for an exemption from steel and aluminium tariffs that kick in May 1, when a temporary waiver expires. â€œWe are asking of everyone: quotas if not tariffs,â€? Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Friday.This puts the EU in the difficult position of either succumbing to US demands that could breach international commerce rules or face punitive tariffs. Forcing governments to limit shipments of goods violates World Trade Organisation rules, which prohibit so-called voluntary export restraints. The demand is also contrary to the entire trade philosophy of the 28-nation bloc, which is founded on the principle of the free movement of goods.EU waiverThe White House last month temporarily shielded some trading partners including the EU from the duties, at 25 per cent for imported steel and 10 per cent for aluminium on the grounds of protecting national security. The president ordered US. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to negotiate with countries seeking permanent exemptions.While WTO rules foresee the possibility of countries taking emergency â€œsafeguardâ€? measures involving import quotas for specific goods, such steps are rare, must be temporary and can be legally challenged. The EU is demanding a permanent, unconditional waiver from the US tariffs.Trumpâ€™s demands to curb steel and aluminium exports to 90 per cent of the level of the previous two years are unacceptable, an EU government official said. The official, who asked not to be named as talks are ongoing, signalled the EUâ€™s response would depend on the level of the quotas after which the punitive tariffs would kick in.So far, South Korea is the only nation to be spared from the duties, after reaching a deal to revise its bilateral free-trade agreement with the US. To avoid the steel tariff, South Korea agreed to limit US shipments of the metal to about 2.7 million tons a year.The country also agreed to double to 50,000 the number of US cars that could be imported without meeting local safety standards. Such unilateral concessions could be legally challenged.Make America greatâ€œIn the short run it might help them solve their trade balance but in the long run it will worsen trade conditions,â€? Bulgarian Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov said in Sofia. â€œIt will create conditions for â€” letâ€™s not use tough words like trade war â€” but it will worsen the conditions and nobody will be a winner from that.â€?â€œThe tools theyâ€™re using to make America great again might result in certain mistakes because free world trade has proven to be the best solution for the development of the world so far,â€? Goranov said.Meanwhile, the EU has made clear it wonâ€™t be intimidated. French President Emmanuel Macron said this month that â€œwe wonâ€™t talk about anything while thereâ€™s a gun pointed at our head.â€?German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she discussed trade disputes with Trump during talks at the White House on Friday and that she failed to win a public commitment to halt the tariffs.â€œThe president will decide, thatâ€™s clear,â€?

"Washington/Beijing: A dock worker from the eastern port city of Ningbo said he wants China to stand unflinchingly against President Donald Trumpâ€™s demands.A salesman in Beijing hopes his country will keep punching back in the commercial ring â€” even if it hurts his wallet.And a coffee shop owner in the Chinese capital said Trumpâ€™s tariffs have inspired her to retaliate at the store: Sheâ€™s swapping US products for Chinese brands.Experts, meanwhile said that the trade war would negatively affect the interest of US consumers, companies, and the financial system of America.But the whole gamut of arguments surrounding the so-called 'trade imbalance' between the two top trading giants goes much deeper.As the trade war between the worldâ€™s two largest economies unfolds on the international stage, analysts say Trumpâ€™s brash approach to try to win concessions from Beijing has provoked a public fury that could ultimately thwart his efforts.By imposing tariffs on $200 billion (Dh734 billion) more in Chinese goods starting next week, Trump has triggered the likelihood of price increases for many American companies and consumers.Beijing has said it will swiftly retaliate against American exporters â€” a move that stands to hurt US farmers and other companies that sell their products to China.Beijing may also raise obstacles for US companies to do business in China.Hereâ€™s a look at whatâ€™s happening and its likely impact:What is the US doing?The Trump administration will begin taxing $200 billion in Chinese goods starting from Monday. The tariffs will start at 10 per cent and rise to 25 per cent in 2019. The target list is huge, ranging from rattan mats to burglar alarms to bicycles. But the administration struck some items from the originally planned $200 billion tariff list, including bicycle helmets and other child safety products.And, in a victory for Apple Inc, smart watches and some other electronics products wonâ€™t be subject to the new tariffs, either. The administration and Beijing have already imposed import taxes on $50 billion worth of each otherâ€™s products. Beijingâ€™s target list of US goods to penalise was heavy on agriculture. Thatâ€™s hardly a coincidence.The United States has so far imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese products. APIts tariffs are meant to deliver pain to American farmers, who overwhelmingly backed Trump in the 2016 election and whose interests are represented by powerful lobbyists and members of Congress. Exports to China account for about 60 per cent of the overseas sales of American soybean farmers, who stand to lose sales as a result of Chinaâ€™s tariffs.What is behind the US-China trade rift?The Trump administration has accused China of using predatory tactics in a lawless drive to overtake Americaâ€™s technological supremacy. US officials point to Beijingâ€™s long-range development plan, â€œMade in China 2025,â€? which calls for creating powerful Chinese entities in such areas as information technology, robotics, aerospace equipment, electric vehicles and biopharmaceuticals.Foreign business groups argue that â€œMade in China 2025â€? is unfairly forcing them to the sidelines in those industries. The Office of the US Trade Representative concluded after an investigation that Chinaâ€™s tactics range from requiring US and other foreign companies to hand over technology in return for access to the vast Chinese market to outright cyber-theft. The US also asserts that Beijing uses state money to buy American technology at prices unaffordable for private companies.How has China responded to the new tariffs?China said on Tuesday that it has no choice but to retaliate against new US trade tariffs. The Chinese commerce ministryâ€™s brief statement gave no details on Chinaâ€™s plans, but Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the US steps have brought â€œnew uncertaintyâ€? to talks between the two countries.â€œChina has always emphasised that the only correct way to resolve the China-US trade issue is via talks and consultations held on an equal, sincere and mutually respectful basis. But at this time, everything the US does, doesnâ€™t give the impression of sincerity or goodwill,â€? he added. Geng said he would not comment on â€œhypotheticalsâ€? such as what measures Beijing might consider apart from tariffs on US products, saying only that details would be released at the appropriate time.What happens if China retaliates?Trump warned on Monday that if China takes retaliatory action against US farmers or industries, â€œwe will immediately pursue phase three, which is tariffs on approximately $267 billion of additional imports.â€? The latest US duties spared smart watches from Apple and Fitbit and other consumer products such as baby car seats.A truck transports a shipping container at the cargo terminal port in Qingdao in east China's Shandong province. APBut if the administration enacts the additional tariffs it would engulf all remaining US imports from China and Apple products like the iPhone and its competitors would not likely be spared. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Tuesday it was up to Beijing to decide the terms of any upcoming negotiations.Isnâ€™t the US also sparring with other trade partners?Trump is battling in just about every direction. He has imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminium â€” action that has drawn retaliatory tariffs from US allies like Canada, Mexico and the European Union. The president is also threatening to impose tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts on the grounds that they pose a threat to Americaâ€™s national security.Trump also wants to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, which includes the US, Mexico and Canada, with a new agreement that would shift more auto production to the US. The administration has already reached a deal with Mexico that excluded Canada. Talks to keep Canada in a North American trade bloc have been ongoing, with the two longtime allies divided over such issues as Canadaâ€™s dairy market and US efforts to shield drug companies from generic competition.By brawling with Americaâ€™s friends, critics say, Trump has squandered an opportunity to build a united front against China. After all, Europe, Japan and other rich countries have the same complaints about Chinese trade practices that America does.Will Trumpâ€™s strategy help find a resolution soon?â€œWe are under no pressure to make a deal with China, they are under pressure to make a deal with us,â€? Trump tweeted last week. The change of tone effectively ties Chinese President Xi Jinpingâ€™s hands, said James Zimmerman, former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. â€œGetting the Chinese to the bargaining table should be all about face-saving â€” not a chest-thumping exercise,â€? Zimmerman said.The Wall Street Journal has it wrong, we are under no pressure to make a deal with China, they are under pressure to make a deal with us. Our markets are surging, theirs are collapsing. We will soon be taking in Billions in Tariffs & making products at home. If we meet, we meet? â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 13, 2018â€œXi has no choice but to stand firm and stand tall.â€? There have been periodic reports that the Trump administration was on the verge of resuming talks with Beijing. Informal communications are still going on, administration officials have said, but no formal talks are scheduled.Have there been trade wars before?Youâ€™d have to go back to the 1930s to find anything close to the hostility between the US and its top trading partners right now. During the Great Depression, many countries, including the US, closed their markets to imports. A plunge in global trade likely worsened the Depression. Many less intense trade conflicts have followed.President Ronald Reagan slapped tariffs on $300 million worth of Japanese imports in a dispute over the semi-conductor industry and strong-armed Tokyo into accepting limits on car shipments to the United States. In 2002, President George W. Bush imposed tariffs on Chinese steel. The move allowed US steel producers to increase prices, raising costs for companies that buy steel and pressuring them to cut back elsewhere. But the tariffs are thought to have cost significant US job losses.Major reset ahead, Emirates chief saysUS President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade battles and the accumulation of global debt to pre-financial crisis levels are among factors that will drive a major reset of the world economy in the next two to three years, according to the head of the worldâ€™s biggest long-haul airline.â€œWe have some extraordinary geopolitical forces at play,â€? Emirates chief Tim Clark told attendees at an aviation event in the Indian Ocean nation of Mauritius. The industry could be facing a â€œminiâ€? global financial crisis within two to three years and â€œthere is going be a major reset,â€? he added.The US is set to impose tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports spanning bicycles and baseball gloves to digital cameras, two months after introducing a first round of levies. China has promised to respond in an ongoing tit-for-tat. The International Monetary Fund has warned that an escalating trade war could undermine the strongest global upswing in years.Thereâ€™s already intense competition in the Chinese market and declining passenger traffic from there to North America has prompted US airlines to withdraw from some core routes to the worldâ€™s second biggest economy. Air China has complained that subsidies for its rivals is distorting the market and lowering fares beyond whatâ€™s economically viable. Carriers will have to learn how to deal with dumping by heavily subsidised state-owned carriers, Clark added.Alibabaâ€™s Ma sees 20-year trade warBeijing: Billionaire Jack Ma sent out a grave warning regarding the trade war between the US and China: Itâ€™s going to last longer and have a bigger impact than most people think.Chinaâ€™s richest man said the dispute could last 20 years and persist beyond the presidency of Donald Trump, as the worldâ€™s two strongest economic powers battle for global supremacy.China needs to strengthen its economy to deal with the conflict and shift trade relations from the US to regions like Southeast Asia and Africa, the chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said during a speech at the companyâ€™s investor day conference in Hangzhou.â€œShort term, business communities in China, US, Europe will all be in trouble,â€? Ma said, pacing a stage in an open white dress shirt and punctuating his remarks with forceful jabs. â€œThis thing will last long. If you want a short-term solution, there is no solution.â€?Ma said Alibaba will also be affected by the rising tensions, given its wholesale business allows American merchants to source products from China. But he also said the trauma will offer unprecedented opportunities for companies that can take advantage of them. â€œWe should not focus on this quarter or next quarter or next yearâ€™s profit. This is a huge opportunity,â€? he said. â€œIf Alibaba cannot sustain and grow, no company in China can grow. Iâ€™m 100 per cent confident in that.â€? Maâ€™s remarks carry particular weight because he is an icon of Chinese innovation and has been seen as an ambassador to the US. Last year, he met with Trump and promised to create 1 million jobs in the US through 2021.5 ways Trumpâ€™s tariffs on $200b in China goods could be feltBy imposing taxes on an additional $200b in Chinese goods, President Donald Trump has intensified a battle of wills between the worldâ€™s two largest economiesBaltimore: By imposing taxes on an additional $200 billion (Dh734 billion) in Chinese goods, President Donald Trump has intensified a battle of wills between the worldâ€™s two largest economies â€” and the outcome is far from certain. Here is a look at five potential consequences:ConsumersUnlike the first two rounds of tariffs totalling $50 billion, the new taxes launched by Trump would more directly hit American consumers. â€œAs president, it is my duty to protect the interests of working men and women, farmers, ranchers, businesses, and our country itself,â€? Trump said.Starting next Monday, the US is to begin charging a 10 per cent tax on thousands of Chinese imports â€” tyres, windshield wipers, baseball gloves, bicycles, snakeskin pants, backpacks, trombone cases, refrigerators and wooden furniture, among others. The list runs 194 pages. Unless the administration reaches a truce with Beijing, Trumpâ€™s import tax will jump to 25 per cent in 2019.After Trump announced tariffs on washing machines toward the start of 2018, the price for laundry equipment shot up 16 per cent between February and May, according to an analysis by Mark Perry, an economics professor at the Flint campus of the University of Michigan.CompaniesMany companies have warned that Trumpâ€™s tariffs threaten to disrupt their businesses and depress their revenue. The monthly manufacturing index by the Institute of Supply Management noted that some companies have expressed concern about tariffs despite an otherwise robust US economy.One food and beverage firm in the ISM survey said, â€œSuppliers appear to be bracing us for cost increases, given increased talk of tariffs and inflation.â€? Trumpâ€™s tariffs, with their uncertain duration, make it difficult for companies to plan for the future. Ted Murphy, a trade lawyer and a partner at Baker McKenzie, said the president is signalling that many companies will need to rethink their operations.Financial MarketsSo far, the stock market has taken the threats of tariffs in stride. Share prices have dipped, only to then resume their growth, in part because of deep corporate tax cuts that took effect this year and a solid US economy in its 10th straight year of expansion.But the new round of tariffs risks triggering a more alarming response by investors. The additional taxes suggest that the two countries are struggling to make progress in settling their differences. â€œItâ€™s definitely a setback for the market that they canâ€™t seem to get to the table,â€? said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade.Global EconomyA prolonged trade war between the US, the worldâ€™s largest economy, and China, the second-largest, would ripple through the rest of the globe. Tariffs could translate into less trade, which could hinder growth in smaller nations. The US dollar has already begun to rise in value as trade tensions have mounted. This has insulated the United States from higher prices.But the higher-valued dollar has also diminished the value of currencies of emerging markets â€“ which has weighed heavily on their economies. In the meantime, the value of the Chinese yuan has dropped relative to the dollar, making it easier for Beijing to withstand US tariffs.PoliticsThe Republicansâ€™ control of the House and the Senate is at stake in the midterm congressional races in November. Trump has portrayed the import taxes as a winning electoral issue because theyâ€™re forcing other countries to compromise with the US. But public opinion suggests that his tariffs could prove a vulnerability.A poll released August 24 by The Associated Press-NORC Centre for Public Affairs Research found that 61 per cent of Americans disapproved of the presidentâ€™s handling of trade negotiations. If Democrats win, it would possibly repudiate Trumpâ€™s approach. But if many Republicans retain their seats, it could vindicate Trumpâ€™s choice to announce tariffs so close to the elections.AP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(Bloomberg) -Wednesday, July 18, 2018 at 3:31 pm |An oil tanker anchored last May outside the Kinder Morgan Inc. Westridge oil terminal in Vancouver, Canada, at the end of the Trans Mountain pipeline that begins in northern Alberta. (AP Photo/Jeremy Hainsworth)With President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade war against Canada showing no sign of abating, the work on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion thatâ€™s starting next month may seem Heaven-sent for a nation striving to reduce dependence on its southern neighbor.After all, the Canadian federal governmentâ€™s main rationale for saving the project from abandonment with a $3.5 billion purchase from Kinder Morgan was the promise that the bigger line will help the nationâ€™s producers ship more crude to fast-growing importers like China and India. But lost in the debate is the fact that very few of the 300,000 barrels of oil and refined fuels a day the existing Trans Mountain line ships from Alberta to Canadaâ€™s Pacific coast are making their way to Asia.In fact, in the past year, only two of the 48 tankers that entered the Westridge Dock or Parkland Burnaby terminals have departed directly for Asia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One of those vessels left for South Korea in April, and the other departed for China earlier this month. Both were carrying an estimated 550,000 barrels of crude.The result is that essentially all of Canadaâ€™s crude oil exports for the first four months of the year have gone to the U.S., according to National Energy Board statistics. Some doubt that the Trans Mountain expansion will change that trend.The idea that Trans Mountain will help Canadian producers get better prices in Asia is â€œfiction,â€? said Jeff Rubin, an independent economist who previously served as chief economist of CIBC World Markets. â€œThe highest prices for heavy oil are in the U.S. Gulf, and thatâ€™s because thatâ€™s where the greatest amount of heavy-oil refinery capacity is.â€?Refiners in Asia have typically paid lower prices for crude grades comparable to Canadian heavy oil, such as Mexican Maya, rather than higher ones, he said. Prices for that blend are about $8 a barrel less in Asia than on the Gulf Coast, he said.Last year, about 54 percent of the volume carried on Trans Mountain was crude oil shipped to Washington State refineries via the Puget Sound System, according to the pipelineâ€™s website. About 42 percent of the lineâ€™s crude and refined products made it all the way to the Burnaby storage terminal and the Westridge marine station. The remainder ended up at a refined-products storage facility in Kamloops, B.C.Kinder Morgan Canada expects that the majority of the capacity that the expansion is adding to the line will be for exports from Westridge destined for markets including Washington, California and Asia. However, actual destinations will depend on market conditions, the company said.â€œThis project came about in response to requests from oil shippers to help them reach new markets in the Pacific Rim,â€? the company said in an emailed statement. â€œThe limited capacity of the system today prohibits shippers from establishing reliable access to trade consistently with these markets.â€?For now, Trans Mountain crude is going mostly to U.S. West Coast refiners that have grown increasingly reliant on imports amid declining production from Alaska and California. U.S. West Coast refineries, with 2.8 million barrels a day of capacity, received 454 million barrels of crude from outside the U.S. last year from countries including Saudi Arabia, Canada and Colombia, the most in Energy Department data reaching back to 1981.In California alone, imported crude accounted for a record 57 percent of oil used in the stateâ€™s refineries last year, according to state data going back to 1982. Californiaâ€™s own crude oil accounted for 31 percent, down from 61 percent 35 years earlier, while Alaskan oil accounted for 12 percent.But once the Trans Mountain expansion is complete, and an additional 590,000 barrels of oil are flowing to the coast, more oil will be available for export, said Kevin Birn, a director on the North American crude oil markets team at IHS Markit. Right now only about 25,000 barrels of oil a day from Trans Mountain is left over and available for export, he said.â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter if the terminal exists, if you donâ€™t have enough crude going through it, you canâ€™t load a vessel,â€? Birn said.Asian refiners are likely to be interested in obtaining some of that supply, said Dinara Millington, vice president of research at the Canadian Energy Research Institute. China has refining capacity for the heavy crudes produced by Canada and Saudi Arabia, as well as its own domestic production.The appeal of Canadian crude is that the oil sands produce predictable, steady supplies with little geopolitical risk and reservoirs that are forecast to last around 50 years, she said.â€œThey want to diversify their suppliers,â€? Millington said. â€œThey donâ€™t want to depend only on Middle Eastern countries.â€?In Kinder Morganâ€™s 2013 application for Trans Mountain, the company estimated that exports to California would garner a $3 to $4 a barrel premium to exports to the Gulf Coast and shipments to Asia would garner prices $2 per barrel higher. The companyâ€™s base case for the project forecasts shipments of 354,000 barrels of crude a day being shipped to Asia, according to a report conducted for the application by IHS.For its part, Canadaâ€™s oil industry is agnostic on where it sells its products, said Tim McMillan, chief executive officer of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, the industryâ€™s largest trade group.â€œYou have access to global markets, and whether itâ€™s bought by an American refinery, a Chinese refinery, a Japanese or a Korean refiner doesnâ€™t matter as much as youâ€™re getting world price,â€? McMillan said. â€œWhere it ultimately goes is where the market places the highest value on it.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"* Rebar hits 7-week low, iron ore near 3-month low* China warns will respond in case of trade war with U.S.* China Feb steel exports down 16 pct yr/yr* China steel demand may pick up from late March -CRU (Adds comment, China data; updates prices)By Manolo Serapio JrMANILA, March 8 (Reuters) - Chinese steel and iron ore futures tumbled almost 4 percent on Thursday, pressured by soft demand in the worldâ€™s top consumer of both commodities and after China warned it will respond as necessary in the event of a trade war with the United States.U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to impose tariff of 25 percent on imported steel this week in a bid to counter cheap shipments, especially from China.While Chinaâ€™s steel exports only accounted for about 2.9 percent of U.S. imports last year, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing â€œwould have to make a justified and necessary responseâ€? in case of a trade war with the United States.Chinaâ€™s total steel exports fell 16 percent from a year ago to 4.85 million tonnes in February, data showed. Its iron ore imports dropped 16 percent from January to 84.27 million tonnes.The most-actively traded rebar contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange declined 3.7 percent to close at 3,794 yuan ($600) a tonne, just off the dayâ€™s trough of 3,792 yuan, its weakest since Jan. 17.But CRU analyst Richard Lu said weaker Chinese demand was the main reason for the price slide.â€œItâ€™s a short-term thing primarily because demand hasnâ€™t really recovered at the moment,â€? said Lu.Steel prices rose shortly after last monthâ€™s Lunar New Year holiday in response to further output curbs planned by Chinese cities including top steel-producing Tangshan beyond the end of the winter heating season on March 15.But they have since dropped after traders built up ample stocks, with demand remaining slow, he said, adding the price decline should be short-lived.â€œFrom late March to mid-May should be the peak season for construction steel products consumption because of the relatively good weather (following winter),â€? he said.Steel traders have lifted stocks sharply in anticipation of a recovery in demand, with rebar inventory reaching 7.13 million tonnes on Feb. 23, the most since March last year, data compiled by SteelHome consultancy showed. SH-TOT-RBARINVA separate inventory taken by Mysteel consultancy showed steel stocks at Chinese traders topping 10 million tonnes on March 1, said Lu.Steelâ€™s weakness spread to prices of its raw materials. The most-traded May iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange ended down 3.8 percent at the intraday low of 500.50 yuan per tonne, a level last seen on Dec. 15.Coking coal dropped 3.4 percent to 1,324.50 yuan a tonne and coke slid 3.1 percent to 2,112 yuan.Iron ore for delivery to Chinaâ€™s Qingdao port .IO62-CNO=MB slipped 0.3 percent to $75.84 a tonne on Wednesday, its weakest since Feb. 5, according to Metal Bulletin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DALIAN, China (Reuters) - Chinaâ€™s steel demand will remain firm despite the countryâ€™s escalating trade war with the United States, and any efforts by Washington to â€œsabotageâ€? the Chinese economy will not succeed, the head of Chinaâ€™s steel association said.FILE PHOTO: Workers cut rail tracks at the construction site of subway line Number 1 in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, China November 17, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer/File Photoâ€œThe U.S. wants Chinese demand to go down but the U.S. doesnâ€™t have the ability to command the Chinese economy,â€? Liu Zhenjiang, president of the China Iron and Steel Association, told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry conference.â€œThe U.S. wants to sabotage the Chinese economy but China is in charge of its own economy.â€?China on Tuesday imposed fresh tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. imports, retaliating soon after the Trump administration slapped tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports as the trade war between the worldâ€™s two largest economies escalates.Liu said steel demand in China, the worldâ€™s largest consumer of the metal alloy, will remain stable despite the trade spat, supported by increased infrastructure spending such as urban rail projects.â€œItâ€™s hard to see a big jump in (demand) from the property market, since there are some controls from the policy side,â€? he said.Plans by the cities of Shenzhen, Suzhou and Changchun to build 44 subway lines totalling about 1,600 km (1,000 miles) are estimated to require about 80 million tonnes of steel, accounting for 10 percent of Chinaâ€™s annual steel demand, according to Reuters calculations based on industry standards for subway design.â€œThe current financial risk is triggered by the U.S. and itâ€™s a man-made problem,â€? said Liu.But some Chinese steel producers are opting for caution, limiting exports to overseas markets amid the trade dispute.â€œItâ€™s hard to do export business,â€? said Zhang Sanjian, board chairman Angang Group International Trade Corp.â€œOur export volume has already declined and we have reduced our proportion of exports (to total sales),â€? said Zhang.Last month, Baoshan Iron and Steel, Chinaâ€™s biggest listed steelmaker, said it expects to reduce its exports to the United States in the second half of this year.Chinaâ€™s steel exports fell 13.1 percent to 47.2 million tonnes from January to August.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RIG-OL-USA-BHI [RIG/U]Escalating trade disputes between the U.S, China and other countries have dimmed the outlook for economic growth and boosted the U.S. dollar, making oil more expensive for consumers using other currencies.Currencies of major emerging economies including China, India and Turkey have slumped.Despite these worries, prices got a boost from U.S. sanctions against Iran, which from November will affect oil exports from that country.Although the European Union, China and India oppose the U.S. sanctions against Iran, many are expected to bow to U.S. pressure.Analysts expect Iranian crude exports to fall by between 500,000 and 1.3 million barrels per day, with buyers in Japan, South Korea and India already dialing back orders.The reduction will depend on whether buyers of Iranian oil receive waivers that would allow some imports.The International Energy Agency said on Friday the oil market could see more turbulence.â€œThe recent cooling down of the market, with short-term supply tensions easing, currently lower prices, and lower demand growth might not last,â€? the IEA said in a monthly report.â€œAs oil sanctions against Iran take effect, perhaps in combination with production problems elsewhere, maintaining global supply might be very challenging.â€?Investors are wary of the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing.In the latest round of levies, China said it would impose additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports.Although crude oil was removed from the list, replaced by refined products and liquefied petroleum gas, analysts say Chinese imports of U.S. crude will fall significantly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Containers are seen at the Yangshan Deep Water Port in Shanghai, China April 24, 2018. REUTERS/Aly SongHONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - The U.S.-China trade war will be fought in the trenches, and itâ€™s going to get ugly. The first round of tariffs hits on Friday, and U.S. President Donald Trump says they might come to cover more than $500 billion of goods. Exporters will feel the pain first, but uncertainty will also dampen investment, impede research and twist reform. It marks a moment of mourning for those who hoped the worldâ€™s two largest economies could work things out.The American tariffs kick in after midnight in Washington (0401 GMT) on July 6, covering $34 billion of imports. That will be followed by taxes on another $16 billion. Trump said Thursday that the final amount of imports covered could exceed $500 billion. Beijing will retaliate in kind, at least at the start.The initial round of U.S. duties cover just 2 percent of Chinaâ€™s total exports, calculate analysts at JPMorgan. They reckon that even if the White House slapped a 25 percent tariff on every Chinese product sold in the United States, Chinese economic growth would slow by only around 0.5 percentage points.More damage could come from economic aftershocks. Equity markets in China and the United States have swooned already, in part because investors worry that global supply chains will need to reroute. Some American businesses say they are already scaling back or postponing capital spending because of uncertainties around trade, according to minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee. In China, the government has been forced to moderate monetary policy to cushion financial markets.The conflict is likely to escalate beyond trade. The Trump administration last month curbed visas for Chinese students, and Congress looks set to toughen vetting of foreign investment in the country, which will restrain Chinese capital.In the Peopleâ€™s Republic, Reuters reported the bureaucracy may have already started to move against American companies. Administrative punishments can range from approval delays to product boycotts to blocking deals â€“ like Qualcommâ€™s attempt to buy NXP. In addition, Chinaâ€™s reform process might slow, as officials hold back liberalisations for use as concessions during future negotiations.The root of the conflict is mutual mistrust between China and the United States, and waning confidence in the benefits of openness. Such suspicion may ultimately do more damage than tariffs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"PARIS (Reuters) - No one emerges victorious from a trade war, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said on Wednesday, warning that the economic impact of U.S. import tariffs would be serious if other countries respond with their own barriers.International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde looks on during an IMF conference in Jakarta, Indonesia February 27, 2018. REUTERS/BeawihartaOn Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated his plan to slap big tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, warning the European Union it would get hit with a â€œbig taxâ€? for failing to treat the United States well over trade matters.â€œThe macro-economic impact would be serious, not only if the United States took action, but especially if other countries were to retaliate, notably those who would be most affected, such as Canada, Europe, and Germany in particular,â€? Lagarde said on French radio RTL.Trumpâ€™s comments have sparked cries of foul play from U.S. trading partners and warnings from U.S. lawmakers and businesses of the potential for a tit-for-tat trade war that could hurt the U.S. economy. Trump has said the United States could win such a war, since it was running such a large trade deficit.â€œIn a so-called trade war, driven by reciprocal increases of import tariffs, nobody wins, one generally finds losers on both sides,â€? Lagarde said, adding that she hoped that Trump would not implement the tariffs threat.Trumpâ€™s top economic advisor Gary Cohn, seen as a voice for Wall Street in the White House, said he would resign after he lost the fight against Trump over the tariffs.The EU executive will discuss potential retaliation measures on Wednesday. It has drawn up a list of U.S. products from bourbon to Harley Davidson motorbikes on which to apply tariffs if Trump follows imposes tariffs.French European Affairs Minister Nathalie Loiseau the EU would raise the tariff threat with the WTO.â€œWe are not happy about this,â€? Loiseau told Radio Classique. â€œEurope can no longer afford to be naive and passive faced with this aggressive protectionism,â€? she said.CHOKE ON WORLD GROWTHLagarde indicated that Trump might have a case for threatening tariffs, saying there were â€œa few good reasonsâ€? to protest against the current situation.â€œThere are some countries in the world that do not respect the World Trade Organisation agreements, and which impose technology transfers. China is a case in point but it is not the only country with such practices,â€? she said.But she said international trade was an engine for growth, innovation and competitiveness and cautioned that any threat to trade was risky for world growth.â€œIf world trade were jeopardized by such measures (tariffs), they would become a vector for lower growth and a slowdown of commerce. The impact on growth would be a formidable,â€? she said.Lagarde said she had the impression that the White House had not thought through the risks of retaliation.â€œIt looks like two camps have fought over whether or not to implement such measures and that one of the camps won the upper hand,â€? she said.Lagarde, a former French finance minister, also said growing income inequality was a barrier to sustainable growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is prepared to quickly ramp up a trade war with China and has told aides he is ready to impose tariffs on $200 billion more in Chinese imports as soon as a public comment period on the plan ends next week, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.The White House declined comment on the Bloomberg report, which cited six unidentified sources, and deflated markets. The S&P hit session lows, and the U.S. dollar, Chinese yuan and U.S. Treasury yields also fell.Trump has credited his electoral success to his hard line on trade, which he has argued hurts U.S. workers and favors foreign competitors. Washington is demanding Beijing improve market access and intellectual property protections for U.S. companies, cut industrial subsidies and slash a $375 billion trade gap.The worldâ€™s two largest economies have already applied tariffs to $50 billion of each otherâ€™s goods in a tit-for-tat trade war. Talks aimed at easing tensions ended last week without major breakthroughs.â€œSo-called hardline, pressure-exerting methods of the U.S. side wonâ€™t work on China and are not helpful to resolving the problem,â€? Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Friday when asked about the report.Chinaâ€™s position is to resolve the issue via pragmatic talks on an equal basis, which is what the international community wants to see, she added.Washingtonâ€™s new proposed 25 percent tariffs would affect consumer products including home building supplies, technology products, bicycles and apparel.A public comment period on the proposal is set to end on Sept. 6, and Trump plans to impose the tariffs after that deadline, Bloomberg said.U.S. President Donald Trump listens to participants during an event at which he announced a grant for a drug-free communities support program in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., August 29, 2018.

Trump administration officials have been divided over how hard to push Beijing.Trump, who has threatened to impose duties on virtually all of the more than $500 billion of Chinese goods exported to the United States each year, told Reuters in an interview earlier this month that resolving the trade war with China would â€œtake timeâ€? and that he had â€œno time frameâ€? for ending it.The report on Trumpâ€™s China stance coincides with U.S. negotiators pushing to hammer out a deal with Canadian counterparts to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinaâ€™s exports surged more than expected in July despite U.S. duties and its closely watched surplus with the United States remained near record highs, as the worldâ€™s two major economic powers ramp up a bitter dispute that some fear could derail global growth.In the latest move by President Donald Trump to put pressure on Beijing to negotiate trade concessions, Washington is set to begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese goods on Aug. 23.In a statement on its official website late on Wednesday, Chinaâ€™s commerce ministry criticised the U.S. move as being â€œunreasonableâ€?, saying it had no choice but to adopt the same measure on an equal amount of American goods ranging from fuel and steel products to autos and medical equipment.Wednesdayâ€™s Chinese data provide the first readings of the overall trade picture for the worldâ€™s second-largest economy since U.S duties on $34 billion of Chinese imports came into effect on July 6.All the same, Chinaâ€™s exports for July rose a bigger than expected 12.2 percent year-on-year, showing little tariff impact for now and beating Juneâ€™s 11.2 percent rise and analysts expectations in a Reuters poll for 10 percent growth.Of more direct consequence in the Sino-U.S. trade war, Chinaâ€™s surplus with the United States shrank only marginally to $28.09 billion last month from a record $28.97 billion in June. Washington has long criticised Chinaâ€™s trade surplus with the United States and has demanded Beijing cut it.Those demands could get even more strident if the yuanâ€™s sharp drop in recent months raises the ire of the United States, which has in the past repeatedly criticised Beijing for manipulating its currency to gain an unfair trade advantage.Economists say China appears to be taking a more hands-off approach to the yuan, which marked its worst 4-month fall on record between April and July and has provided some reprieve for exporters in the face of the rising trade tensions.ANZ senior China economist Betty Wang said Beijing will likely resist using its closely managed currency as a tool in the trade war.â€œCurrency devaluation, which may have helped exports to some extent, has been largely market-driven in our view and is not a preferred policy tool by Chinese policy makers as part of the retaliation measures,â€? Wang said.Chinaâ€™s trade with the U.S. also continued to rise in July despite the tariffs, with exports up 11.2 percent year-on-year, and imports increasing 11.1 percent.Analysts still expect a less favourable overall trade balance for China in coming months given itâ€™s early days in the tariff brawl.BEIJING BOOSTS LIQUIDITY SUPPORTAfter a strong start to the year, growth in the worldâ€™s second-largest economy cooled slightly in the second quarter, partly hit by the governmentâ€™s years-long efforts to tackle debt risks.A container ship sails into Hong Kong, China July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/FilesChinaâ€™s imports rose 27.3 percent year-on-year in July, in a sign domestic demand remains solid, but the worry is that the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war, rising corporate bankruptcies, and a steep decline in the yuan could put a significant dent on the economy.The government has responded by releasing more liquidity into the banking system, encouraging lending and promising a more â€œactiveâ€? fiscal policy.World financial markets have taken a battering in recent months as fears grow that Trumpâ€™s â€œAmerica Firstâ€? policies could derail a global economic revival.Several large American companies have said they would adjust their supply chains to source outside of China if tariffs on Chinese goods impacted them, while Chinaâ€™s Haier Group said rising steel prices amid hefty U.S. import tariffs was driving up costs for its business in America.In a sign there may be more difficulties ahead, a private survey last week found that the business outlook among Chinese services firms was the second-weakest on record in July in part due worries about the trade war.â€œSTICK OF HEGEMONYâ€?China has repeatedly warned it will strike back against any further punitive measures by Trump, saying the United States is threatening the global free trade order with its protectionism.Chinese state media, reflecting the governmentâ€™s stance, has said China will not be cowed in the face of U.S. threats.The latest commentary from state media on Wednesday took a softer line after resorting to personal attacks against Trump earlier in the week, saying China could get through the storm but refrained from directly mentioning the U.S. president.All Chinaâ€™s main state newspapers published a lengthy commentary by the official Xinhua news agency, entitled â€œdeclarationâ€?, on their front pages.â€œCertain people go against the tide for their own private ends and go against morality; the barrier of tariffs wantonly rise, and the stick of hegemony is raised all around,â€? the commentary said.â€œAlthough this may for a moment bring preening with delight, it will make it hard to resolve economic imbalances or out of kilter politics and other deep-rooted problems,â€? it said.China has not yet given a date for its previously announced retaliatory tariffs on $16 billion in U.S. goods, which will target commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, coal and some refined oil products.The latest $16 billion list from the United States will hit semiconductors from China, even though many of the basic chips in these products originate from the United States, Taiwan or South Korea.Slideshow (3 Images)John Neuffer, president and CEO of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said in a statement they were disappointed and puzzled why semiconductors remain on the final tariff list.â€œWe have made the case to the Administration, in the strongest possible terms, that tariffs imposed on semiconductors imported from China will hurt Americaâ€™s chipmakers, not Chinaâ€™s, and will do nothing to stop Chinaâ€™s problematic and discriminatory trade practices,â€? he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you want to know why Donald Trump shouldnâ€™t expect to win a trade war against China, look no further than Alibaba, the countryâ€™s giant e-commerce version of Amazon. Last month, I had two in-depth conversations with Ming Zeng, the e-commerce giantâ€™s head of strategic planning and among the smartest minds in business and finance in China. Ming made it clear that China has little real need for America any more â€“ not U.S. products, but especially not U.S. ideas. When thwarted, China has shown it can think up its own.A China Shipping container is loaded at a terminal Hamburg, Germany July 27, 2018. REUTERS/Fabian BimmerAt the same time, the Trump administration seems to be doing its level best to run a competition calculated from the starting gate to lose the race, or the war, whichever it turns out to be. The U.S. presidentâ€™s latest effort was to threaten a rise in tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods â€“ from 10 percent to 25 percent. Within 24 hours, China quickly reciprocated with a list of 5,207 American products, worth $60 billion, on which it pledged to exact new tariffs ranging from 5 to 25 percent if Trump implements his threats.And there weâ€™ll have a full-blown trade war.Fortunately, Trump has extended a comment period before implementation until September. Meanwhile, markets on both sides of the Pacific continue unsettled â€“ at times balancing on the edge of panic.While the Chinese stock market has taken more of a beating than the American, Trump seems to think that the United States can stand the pain longer than China and tightening the screws will bring Beijing to the negotiating table. But that reflects little understanding of either the Chinese mindset or the underlying strength of the Chinese economy which, though weaker than a year ago, is still growing nearly twice as fast as the American.And this by no means reflects how bad it could get as individuals with little understanding of either the stakes or the mechanisms plunge into this pending maelstrom.Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo unveiled with some fanfare another way of dealing with, even isolating China, that approaches the ridiculous in its scale and futility. Dubbed the â€œIndo Pacific Economic Vision Programâ€? it was widely viewed as a counter to Chinaâ€™s long-standing Belt and Road development initiative that has ensnared nations across Asia and onward to Europe. But a decidedly skinflint counter. Trump has committed a derisory $113 million to his programâ€“a rounding error compared with the $900 billion estimated for Beijingâ€™s Belt and Road, which China bankrolled at $82 billion three years ago. This hardly even seems to be a competition. Yet as the South China Morning Post put it, the U.S. initiative is â€œlikely to fuel suspicions from Beijingâ€¦ and could in turn worsen relations that are already fraught with trade tensions.â€?Moreover, China seems prepared to do all it can to keep control of its global trading strategy, offering Britain talks leading to a post-Brexit free trade deal on Monday, while continuing to hold the United States at bay.For Washington to win any trade war with Chinaâ€“or even arrive at some mutually satisfactory conclusion, the most desirable outcome in the long runâ€“there must be an understanding of the forces it will be facing. My takeaway from my interviews with Ming, which ran in full in Forbes Asia, as that large swaths of Chinaâ€™s rapidly advancing economy, especially the domestically-focused areas, are either largely immune from any trade imbroglios or will manage to circumvent them.In January, the United States barred a takeover by Alibabaâ€™s Ant Financial of Moneygram, the money transfer agency. So Alibaba created a different, in many respects more innovative, product using blockchain-based technology. â€œAny new business, while growing up, always encounters obstacles. We understand that. It is part of the cost of doing business,â€? Ming said. â€œSo we might be frustrated. But because the value we create is so overwhelming, we will find some way to overcome that barrier.â€?That doesnâ€™t mean that many Chinese companies and state-run enterprises in China arenâ€™t still poised to appropriate innovations from Silicon Valley. But the more America tries to block them, the more likely the Chinese are to come up with their own solutions.Another example: Last year, the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment failed to approve an effort by Navinfo, the Chinese provider of digital maps for autos, to buy a stake in HERE, an Amsterdam-based mapping company that operates in the United States and is 15 percent owned by U.S. chipmaker Intel. So Navinfo, ranked by Forbes as of the worldâ€™s top 100 innovative growth companies, simply withdrew its offer and continued its expanding cooperation with HERE and its German-owned car company partners, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen.To be sure, while China may have a leadership role in markets like the auto market and appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines, it does still lag in fields like artificial intelligence. But, as Ming suggests, â€œitâ€™s not about our size, itâ€™s about our innovation experience and our understanding of where the future goes.â€?It is this profound understanding and acceptance of the long game that may ultimately leave China the winner in any trade war.The Chinese, and especially its leadership, have quite a strong and evolved sense of self. Their ability to withstand external forces dates back not just to Mao Zedong and the communist revolution that brought them to power after World War Two. Itâ€™s more useful to look back to the Zhou dynasty a thousand years before Christ, which based the legitimacy of its emperor on whether he was sufficiently virtuous to rule â€“ and receive the Mandate from Heaven to do so. A people with such an evolved sense of destiny and self-worth is unlikely to see a secular leader like Donald Trump as a major obstacle.In China, losing face is the ultimate failure. While the best, and most lasting, trade agreements must be at least perceived as a win-win, Trump now seems to have dug himself so deeply into his America First corner that it allows little room for the Chinese leadership to maneuver without losing that face. Trump must brace for a long and bruising conflict. But if he is not persuaded to give up, it is all Americans who must prepare to pay for his trade crusade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US sanctions on Iran will tighten global oil supplies sharply until the end of the year, but a threat to world demand looms in 2019 from the US-China trade war, the head of BPâ€™s oil trading in Asia said.Advertisingâ€œWeâ€™re moving into the tightest part of 2018â€¦ the re-imposition of Iran sanctions is the main factor as the market will tighten substantially from now to year-end,â€? Janet Kong, chief executive of Integrated Supply and Trading Eastern Hemisphere at BP told Reuters.Saudi Arabia and Russia wonâ€™t add significantly more oil to the market because of a lack of capacity, a top Iranian official said on Monday, predicting prices will probably rise further.Sanctions on Venezuela are also exacerbating a production decline there, while outages in Nigeria and Libya have further crimped supplies, Kong said, with Brent supported at above $80 a barrel.Advertisingâ€œThe market fundamentals in the short term look very bullish and positive due to supply shocks, but over time, when supply catches up and the shock to demand becomes more evident, the market will go through another round of re-balancing next year,â€? she said.The worldâ€™s two largest economies, China and the United States, have imposed tariffs on each otherâ€™s imports in an escalating trade war that has rattled global markets and raised concerns of a slowdown in world economies and commodities demand next year.â€œGoing into 2019, I worry about the impact of the US-China trade war, manifesting itself slowly,â€? Kong said.â€œThe trade war impact has not really shown up in the data anywhere, but it will show up gradually over time. So the supply shock is very sharp and prompt, while the impact from trade war is boiling over slowly.â€?Analysts and the International Monetary Fund have forecast a 0.5 percent to 1 percent drop in world gross domestic product growth next year, she said.The International Energy Agency said in its monthly oil report that global oil demand is set to to top 100 million bpd next year, although emerging market crises and trade disputes could dent this figure.Advertisingâ€œThe Trump administration wants intellectual property protection â€¦ reducing subsidies to Chinese SOEs (state-owned enterprises) and open market access by all businesses which are difficult, in my view, for the Chinese government to agree to,â€? Kong said.â€œSo itâ€™s very likely this war will drag on for a long time.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the US imposing additional 25 per cent duty on imports worth USD 34 billion from China, certain Indian products may become more competitive, CII said today.AdvertisingAn analysis by the industry chamber revealed that India should focus on the US market for items in the categories of machinery, electrical equipment, vehicles and transport parts, chemicals, plastics and rubber products.â€œIndia can focus on numerous goods for expanding its exports to the US and China markets following the hike in duties by both countries on imports from each other,â€? CII said.Top exports from India to the US which are covered in the list of items for which tariffs have been hiked include pumps, parts of military aircraft, parts for electrodiagnostic apparatus, passenger vehicles of 1500-3000 cc, valve bodies and parts of taps, said the chamber.AdvertisingExports of these items stood at over USD 50 million in 2017, according to CII, and can be increased with concerted efforts.Countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia have increased their exports of these products to the US in recent years, the chamber noted.Based on Indiaâ€™s current exports to the US in these categories, products such as intermediate parts for the defence and aerospace sector, vehicles and auto parts, engineering goods, etc. have a higher potential for export, it said.â€œSectors like apparel and textiles, footwear, toys and games and cell phone manufacturing are becoming competitive industries in India and need to be encouraged,â€? CII said.The chamber suggested that the trade dialogue with the US should be strategised taking into account Indiaâ€™s competitive advantage in these products.Moreover, foreign direct investments from the US should be encouraged by boosting confidence of US firms in Indiaâ€™s business climate, said CII, adding that this might necessitate addressing their concerns regarding non-tariff barriers in India for better long term outcomes.AdvertisingIn the domestic industry, it stated that it is important for India to enhance productivity while adding technology to its domestic production in the identified products.CII examined 818 product lines where the US has raised tariffs for imports from China. Between 2012 and 2017, Chinaâ€™s exports to the US have moved up the value chain with accelerated growth in high-technology items such as telecommunications equipment, automotive, cell phones, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"By Ling ChenThe Washington PostThe U.S.-China trade war is ramping up, with threatened tariffs and counter-tariffs. Major U.S. targets have included Chinese tech companies ZTE and Huawei, putting a spotlight on Chinaâ€™s plan to become a technology powerhouse.What key lessons have China learned thus far? Most likely, the Chinese leadership recognized the vulnerability of the countryâ€™s development approach. The paradox is that the current trade war might propel China to come up with more ambitious industrial strategies. Here are three things to consider.1) This is a wake-up call on Chinaâ€™s focus on advanced manufacturingAs my new book shows, China had good reasons to focus on advanced manufacturing in the global supply chain. To catch up on industrial technology in the 1970s, countries such as South Korea protected infant industries through import tariffs until these companies were competitive enough on the international markets.But tariff manipulation isnâ€™t practical in the current context, especially after Chinaâ€™s entrance into the World Trade Organization. And China, like other countries, finds it increasingly difficult to keep up with the speed of technology change.The failure of the multibillion yuan semiconductor chip projects in the 1990s was illustrative: When production lines were finally in place, the technology had already quickly advanced to the next generation, leaving Chinese firms behind.So China has tried to avoid head-on competition in tough tech components such as mobile phone chips in recent years. Instead of constantly running behind established industries, it looks to use manufacturing to break into emerging areas where China still has the possibility to be a leader, such as new materials, green energy and robots. Some of these sectors are included in the Made in China 2025 plan, which aims to establish China as a major global competitor in advanced manufacturing.The big ZTE kerfuffle this spring raised the alarm for Chinaâ€™s approach. In April, the Commerce Department banned U.S. chip exports to ZTE, claiming the Chinese communications company had violated a 2017 settlement on illegal ZTE exports to Iran and North Korea. President Trump then walked the ban back, promising to help protect ZTE jobs, but the Senate voted last week to reinstate the ban.For China, hereâ€™s the problem: Without reliable sources for chips, would Chinese firms survive? After all, what else could Chinese firms do with all their peripheral components, manufacturing skills and related services, even if they are first-rate, without chips, which are produced in the United States? For much of the Chinese population, this was also the first realization that even the countryâ€™s best and brightest firms, like Huawei and ZTE, are dependent on foreign inputs.2) Does core technology still matter under globalization?Chinaâ€™s focus on advanced manufacturing in the global production system rests on the crucial assumption of a smooth trading process along the entire supply chain. Trumpâ€™s tariff wars woke Chinese leaders to the dangers of this assumption. The main issue is not whether a ban like the ZTE event actually takes place. Rather, it is about the recurring possibility that the country could be subject to such an unpredictable event.For China, the issue of the lack of control over core technology suddenly re-emerged in public discussion. Chips in a cellphone are an example of core technology components, just like engines in a plane â€” or the ball in a ballpoint pen. Premier Li Keqiang once quipped that despite its billions of pens produced each year, China still cannot make the ball in a ballpoint pen.But few people in China now joke about chips in electronics and IT products. These are not only expensive components in terms of value-added; they are also associated with industries that are strategic to the economy. Without core component like chips, Chinaâ€™s industrial plan suddenly became more vulnerable.3) What will Chinaâ€™s industrial strategy look like now?Paradoxically, while Made in China 2025 was not as aggressive as the White House portrayed, the tariff war launched by President Trump will almost certainly propel China to come up with a more ambitious industrial strategy. Commentators in China had already begun to discuss how to design new strategies to avoid vulnerability.Granted, the world is an increasingly interdependent place. Even while depending on each other, however, countries still hedge their bets. Some analysts have asked whether there are similarly irreplaceable assets on the Chinese side â€“ such as rare earth elements exported to the United States â€“ to be used as reciprocal leverage. But it is doubtful that these materials are important enough to the U.S. economy.Techno-nationalism is clearly on the rise in China. And Beijing will revive an emphasis on indigenous innovation in core technology, proposed by former president Hu Jintao and mentioned in several recent speeches by President Xi Jinping. There has also been renewed talk this spring about self-reliance and national interest, echoing back to the Maoist period.But developing core technology is not easy, even for large firms. Huawei and ZTE, for instance, have invested a large percentage of their revenue in research and development. Internally, Huawei endorsed a â€œwolf cultureâ€? of the survival of the fittest, and some of its employees moved mattresses on which to sleep in their offices to provide fast solutions for problems. ZTE is a close second in competitiveness. Yet even these top-echelon firms are not able to completely control core technology.The knowledge of these past challenges suggests that China is likely to combine the broader Made in China 2025 advanced manufacturing goals with indigenous innovation in cutting-edge technology â€“ hereâ€™s a good comparison of these approaches.Anti-globalization isnâ€™t on the table â€“ in fact, Chinese officials have been trying to maintain a friendly image toward global opportunities by attracting foreign investors in their free-trade zones.For China and other countries, though, the current trade provocations do give reason to rethink the neoliberal picture of mutually beneficial trade. After all, the ZTE example just demonstrated countries can still be â€œTrumpedâ€? if they adhere too much to global interdependence.Ling Chen is assistant professor at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and the author of â€œManipulating Globalization: The Influence of Bureaucrats on Business in China.â€?This article was written by Ling Chen from The Washington Post and was legally licensed through the NewsCred publisher network.

"It should be a booming time for big oil stocks. Crude prices are rising and exploration opportunities look solid. And indeed, there has been some strength in the sector.Shares of Exxon (NYSE: XOM ), which Iâ€™ve recommended for much of the year, have bounced 13% from late March lows. Chevron (NYSE: CVX ) stock is up 14% from February levels. BP (NYSE: BP ) moved from $38 in early March to a current price near $46, not far from a three-year high.But the group generally has traded flat over the past few weeks â€” despite good news. Prices are rising, and it looks like the recent OPEC meeting wonâ€™t raise supply enough to change that trend. Regulatory pressure in the U.S. has been lightened by the Trump Administration.Clearly, investors in big oil stocks seem at least modestly concerned about the potential for a trade war. And with good reason. Increasing tariffs worldwide raises a number of risks for big oil stocks â€” and for the energy sector as a whole.Risk No. 1: A Global Economic SlowdownOil stocks are generally correlated to the price of crude, as evidenced by the crash in the sector in 2014-2015. Diversified majors like XOM and CVX donâ€™t have quite the same correlation as pure producers like Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: APC ), given the â€˜internal hedgeâ€˜ created by downstream operations.But big oil stocks like XOM, CVX, BP and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS.A , NYSE: RDS.B ) arenâ€™t immune to macro concerns. And so the clear risk to the sector is that a trade war winds up being destructive for the U.S. â€” and the world economy as a whole.Whether an investor sees that risk as material likely comes down to his or her view of the effectiveness of President Donald Trumpâ€™s strategy. If the U.S. â€œwinsâ€?, that could be a boost to the economy â€” and a benefit to mostly local producers like Anadarko and Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD ). If everyone loses in a trade war, as some observers believe, that macro strength would likely lead to lower crude prices. That in turn would pressure stocks across the sector, including the diversified majors.Risk No. 2: Higher CostsAside from oil prices, thereâ€™s also the risk of higher costs. The oil industry already has come out against aluminum and steel tariffs, arguing that they would increase production costs in the field â€” and make pipelines more expensive.That would seem to be a bigger problem for midstream players like Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI ), which is trying to turn around its operations, or Plains All American Pipeline (NYSE: PAA ). But higher transportation costs could echo across the supply chain. Permian Basin pipelines already are nearing their limits, and if pipeline builders face higher costs, they will pass at least some of those costs onto producers like Exxon in that play.Risk No. 3: Closed MarketsFinally, thereâ€™s a risk that a trade war could close off access to export markets â€” most obviously, China. U.S. oil is selling well in Asia due to a wide spread between WTI (West Texas Intermediate) and Brent crude, but demand could dry up if import restrictions are implemented in those countries in response to higher U.S. tariffs.Longer-term, the U.S. has an opportunity to become a net exporter of oil due to the success of shale plays like the Permian. That opportunity comes to an end if major markets like China and Canada wonâ€™t take (or charge high tariffs) on that crude. An artificial cap on international demand means either supply has to be cut back, or a 2015-like glut will hammer oil prices, and take big oil stocks down with it.Is the Risk to Big Oil Stocks Real?Whether the risks are enough to abandon the oil space is in the eye of the beholder. Indeed, thatâ€™s true for the equity market as a whole; after all, itâ€™s far from clear that a trade war will even happen. The U.S. could win key concessions. The Trump Administration could back down. Global or bilateral agreements are still on the table (and in some cases still in existence).And, as Trump has argued, the U.S. still could â€œwin.â€? A renaissance in U.S. manufacturing could add to already high employment, sending economic growth higher. Even with some level of international demand limitations, thatâ€™s likely enough to move crude higher.If an investor sees that as the most likely outcome, the recent pause in big oil stocks is a buying opportunity. If not, thereâ€™s a chance to sell into still-reasonable strength before chaos breaks out. At the least, it seems likely that the movement of oil prices â€” and oil stocks â€” over the next few months will be affected significantly by trade concerns. Investors can place their bets accordingly.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.Legendary Investor Louis Navellierâ€™s Trading BreakthroughDiscovered almost by accident, Louis Navellierâ€™s incredible trading breakthrough has delivered 148 double- and triple-digit winners over the past 5 years â€” including a stunning 487% win in just 10 months.Learn to use this formula and you can start turning every $10,000 invested into as much as $58,700.Click here to review Louisâ€™ urgent presentation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Published on the 28/09/2018 | Written by Pat PilcherMore expensive tech, export declines and falling US tech investment...The US/China trade war of words went largely ignored until the US announced US$50 billion of tariffs on Chinese-produced goods in June. These were, in turn, matched tit-for-tat by China. While US vehicle manufacturers and farmers have begun to feel the pain, fears are emerging that fallout from the spat could spread. But what of its effect on the Australian tech sector?US president, Donald Trump has now announced plans for a further US$200 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods, to which China has retaliated with tariffs on another US$60 billion of US imports. The move prompted a warning from Apple that this would drive up prices for its smartphones, computers, watches, adapters and chargers, all of which get manufactured in mainland China.â€œKnock-on effects are probable for corporates as network switches, routers and other equipment prices see upward pressure.â€?While the Apple Watch and iPhone were among products later exempted from tariffs, the rub is that China accounts for around 20 percent of Appleâ€™s revenues. Fallout from the tariffs will no doubt include some nationalistic anti-US/anti-Apple sentiment likely to impact sales of Appleâ€™s finished products in their market of manufacture. It is just one story line in the complex web of downstream impacts, and, despite exemptions on US steel and aluminium tariffs, Australia will not be immune.An escalating trade war between the worldâ€™s two largest economies is likely to be a lose-lose proposition according to Brendan Rynne, KPMG Chief Economist. â€œInvolvement by a significant number of other countries in a trade war would cut Australian national income by approximately half a trillion dollars over ten years â€“ the equivalent of 40 percent of last yearâ€™s total household disposable income,â€? he says. â€œAround 60,000 jobs would be lost, and real wages pushed down by $16 per week for the average worker.â€?While no other countries have joined the fray, Trumpâ€™s announcement of the additional $200+ billion in tariffs sent ripples through the worldâ€™s currencies, including the Australian dollar.The first real pain is likely to be experienced by Australian technology consumers as a falling Aussie dollar sends the cost of electronics spiralling upwards. With pundits speculating that the Aussie dollar could head south of US$0.60, the cost of imported consumer and business electronics, software and other technology would increase.However, currency fluctuations do tend to correct back to a state of equilibrium over the longer term, but other factors are also at play.In 1990 China accounted for less than three percent of global manufacturing output by value. Since then that figure has grown to close to a quarter. China now manufactures an estimated 80 percent of the worldâ€™s air-conditioners and 70 percent of the worldâ€™s smartphones as well as a vast amount of other electronics.Tariff-inflated prices will likely soften US demand and that will translate to reducing the demand for Chinese imports of raw materials sourced from Australia.Chinese manufacturers hit by tariffs will eventually be forced to pass costs onto customers. The Trump administrationâ€™s hit list of Chinese products facing tariffs includes electronic and networking equipment. How much prices could rise remains to be seen as the next round of tariffs wonâ€™t be announced for several months (many will increase from 10 to 25 percent in January). While Apple, Cisco, Dell and other US multinational tech companies have deep pockets, their willingness to absorb costs triggered by the tariffs wonâ€™t last forever.It isnâ€™t just consumer tech impacted either. The tariffs will affect infrastructure equipment. Knock-on effects are probable for telcos, ISPs and corporates as network switches, cellular stations, routers and other equipment prices see upward pressure.Of more concern is the impact on Australiaâ€™s tech-led exports. These accounted for 14.8 percent of Australian manufactured goods exported overseas, with China accounting for 25 percent of that. In 2015, China announced its â€œMade in China 2025â€? programme, which is intended to decrease Chinaâ€™s dependence on overseas components used by their rapidly growing tech sector. Under the plan, the domestic content of core components and materials is to rise to 40 percent by 2020 and 70 percent by 2025.Should the trade war further escalate, it is probable that the Chinese government could seek to accelerate made in China 2025 deadlines which could see demand for technology imports to China drop more quickly.A more indirect impact of the trade war could be a reduction of US investment in Australian tech startups. Earlier this year, a sell-off of US tech stocks happened after reports surfaced that US officials were considering the introduction of restrictions that would block Chinese companies from investing in US tech companies.If the trade war further escalates, falling confidence in the tech sector could see it lose significant value. A side effect of such a dip could be a slow down of investment in Australian tech ventures by US firms (which in 2017 injected AU$4.2 billion into the Australian tech sector).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Photo: APPresident Donald Trump and Harley-Davidson have been feuding ever since Harley said it was going to move some production overseas because of Trumpâ€™s trade war. But itâ€™s been mostly one-sided, as Harley has repeatedly declined to comment on the situation even after Trump backed a Harley boycott. Until today, that is.Harley-Davidson Is Still Screwed Today Harley-Davidson announced a plan to ride back to relevance on the saddles of some new bikeâ€¦ Read more ReadThe occasion was Harleyâ€™s 115th anniversary event in Milwaukee, where company executives touted its upcoming electronic bike and its plans to try and enlist millions of new riders as its core demographic, Baby Boomers, age out.Dave Cotteleer, vice president and managing director for the U.S. market, spoke first, after a question and a long and awkward pause.â€œHarley-Davidson is about inclusion. Harley-Davidson is about togetherness. Harley-Davidson is about community. Harley-Davidson is about freedom,â€? Cotteleer said in part. â€œWe, as a company, we strive to be absolutely apolitical, because whatâ€™s important to us is that spirit of togetherness and riding. Thatâ€™s what this celebration is about, and thatâ€™s what weâ€™re focused on this weekend.â€?AdvertisementLater, Marc McAllister, vice president and managing director of international sales, reiterated that Harley was an â€œapolitical organizationâ€? but was a bit more explicit on the trade war.â€œWe believe in a fair playing field for all competitors in the marketplace, so weâ€™ve been working with the administration here as well as the administrations in other countries to try and strive for a fair playing field,â€? McAllister said, referring to the tariffs.If Harleyâ€™s been reluctant to comment on the situation until now, itâ€™s easy enough to see why, as many of the riders coming in for the celebration are also Trump supporters, with Trump paraphernalia not hard to come by. (A lot of that is detailed in this recent New York Times story that goes into the challenge Harley faces, coming up against a president heavily supported by probably the bulk of its customers.)AdvertisementStill, the company wants to survive by expanding sales overseas. Thatâ€™s something which the tariffs have complicated hugely, as Harley was specifically targeted by the European Unionâ€”retaliatory tariffs hit the heartland, and Trumpâ€™s base.McAllister basically said what every automaker has told the Trump administration, the â€œfair playing fieldâ€? here being, presumably, free trade. But Harley is Harley, an American icon, just out here trying to survive even without getting into a fight with Trump. McAllister also defended moving some of Harleyâ€™s production overseas.â€œObviously, we would like nothing more than to build every motorcycle in the United States if we had that [option],â€? he said. â€œWe are continuing to focus on building motorcycles in the United States for the United States and as a business we have to make tough choices to make sure we are competitive in markets outside the United States.â€?AdvertisementAnd while these are Harleyâ€™s first public remarks since for months on the issue, they largely echo what itâ€™s CEO said in an internal memo obtained by CNBC a couple weeks ago.These are all reasonable things to say and do, but Harley has probably found that itâ€™s uncomfortable feud with Trump is asymmetrical, since all Trump has to do is tweet to stir things up. Like this a few weeks ago:AdvertisementWhere do we go from here? A new Trump tweet is probably just around the corner, even if the tariffs likely wonâ€™t be going anywhere anytime soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Robert Stobaugh was just seven-years-old when he started helping out his parents in the agriculture industry in the Blackwell area of Arkansas.An escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, among other countries, has prompted the White House to propose a plan to provide $12 billion of emergency relief to American farmers.The three-pronged plan, which requires no congressional approval, includes providing direct payments for impacted farmers, effort global promotions of U.S. goods and the purchase of surplus American products for donation to food banks.The program depends largely on the Commodity Credit Corporation, a branch of the U.S. Agriculture Department, that provides financial assistance to farmers.Robert Stobaugh, a farmer in Blackwell, Ark. isn't surprised by this latest move by the White House.'It was almost predicted when President Trump started down this path. He said that the farmers would be taken care of but to be honest with you, the $12 billion is a band-aid on a bullet hole,' said soybean farmer Robert.Stobaugh's family roots in the agriculture industry run deep, going back to 1951.'I grew up working here -- started here at about seven years old,' Stobaugh said.Stobaugh and his brothers tend to a little less than 4,000 acres of soybeans yearly. They also grow rice and corn.He's felt the ups and downs of the agriculture business throughout the years. Trump's escalating trade spat with China, among other countries, is proving to be detrimental on the stability of the market.'It's affected the soybean prices here about two dollars a bushel,' Stobaugh said.Michael Pakko, chief economist with the University of Arkansas Little Rock, questions the long-term feasibility of the plan.'The concern is that it could become a more permanent program that if we end up limiting our overseas markets and then supporting the farmers to compensate for them, that that's a situation that is not easily unwound and we up with a new trade regime where we are in direct support of the farming community,' Pakko said.As for Stobaugh, he's preparing for the soybean harvest set to begin in the next few weeks.He stressed the agriculture business is unpredictable, especially when farmers lack control over the markets.Stobaugh remains unsure of what the future holds for the American agriculture industry as the trade dispute trudges on.'I'm not optimistic at all since we're still in the tit for tat stages here. We're still figuring out who's winning.'President Donald Trump is now threatening to impose $500 billion in tariffs on imported Chinese goods.Republican leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan have urged Trump to consider other options to deescalate the trade war.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse is lashing out at President Donald Trump over his comments that trade wars are 'easy to win.'Trump has announced he wants to place new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

He responded after President Trump insisted on Friday that 'trade wars are good, and easy to win.''Kooky 18th century protectionism will jack up prices on American families â€” and will prompt retaliation from other countries,' Sasse says. 'Make no mistake. If the President goes through with this, it will kill American jobs â€” that's what every trade war ultimately does.'Trump says the U.S. will impose punishing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, escalating tensions with China and other trading partners and raising the prospect of higher prices for American consumers and companies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese officials have been mostly measured and moderate in their response to U.S. President Donald Trump's ratcheting up of a trade war with Beijing in recent weeks through his announcement of a series of punitive tariffs. They have generally avoided adding to tensions, allowing the Communist Party's official media to make the most bellicose comments.But the mood on the streets of Beijing and Shanghai is a little less accepting. Reuters talked to a cross section of 50 people, mainly from the two cities, about how concerned they are about the trade war, what they think Beijing's response would be, and whether they think Chinese people should boycott American products in retaliation.The interviews showed there is no palpable sense of crisis or panic yet. There is division and confusion over how China should respond to Trump, with some arguing that Beijing should strike back at American interests but others saying they didnâ€™t know what could be done.But perhaps most worrying for American businesses selling in China, a significant minority of the people interviewed â€“ 14, or 28 percent - want to stop buying American products now, and some say they are already boycotting anything made in the U.S. Others said they would continue to buy American but that could change in the future.If that was representative of the whole of China â€“ and words were turned into action - it might start to put a dent in sales of Apple's iPhones, Disney's movies, Starbucks' drinks and General Motors' cars, among other American products â€“ and that's without any boycott being organized by the government or activists.A decade after China basked in the patriotic glory of an inspirational opening ceremony for the Beijing Olympics, nationalist sentiment is rarely far below the surface.The straw poll's sample is very small and clearly not scientific. The interviews were also conducted in a country where people are often guarded and may well not let foreign media know their real views. Any individual's comments deemed inappropriate â€“ criticism of Xi would fall into this category â€“ could lead to trouble with the authorities.But the views expressed in the 50 interviews are more than the basis for idle curiosity.Here are the results of the straw poll:-Asked whether they were worried about the trade war, only 11 of the 50 (22 percent) said they were, and 39 (or 78 percent) said they weren't concerned.-Asked what Beijing should do in response to Trump's punitive tariffs, 19 (or 38 percent) said that it should strike back hard. The rest came up with various responses, including a refocus on development of the domestic economy, building other export markets, while 8 (or 16 percent) said they had no idea what the government should do.-Asked whether they would stop buying U.S. products, 14 said they would, 31 said they wouldn't (some indicated their views could change if the trade war intensifies), and five didn't have a view.Here are some of the comments from those interviewed:'Of course I'm concerned. It's a clash between the largest and second-largest economy,' said Shanghai stockbroker Cai Qing, 40. 'None of the relevant parties were fully prepared for the trade war. Policies were rushed, including U.S. policies,' he added.'To put it bluntly, Americans have always been so arrogant - they make everyone their manufacturer so they can reap the economic fruit,' said Qu Xinjun, who works in the steel industry in Shanghai.'Trump is waging a psychological war with China. He was trying to intimidate China. From a psychological standpoint, we should not worry about the trade war, but rather focus on domestic development,' he said. 'We should trust our country and the leadership and trust that we can win the war.''China has to hit back, which could show its great power status. China has to win this match,' said Beijing interior decorator Zhang Shiyou, 56.China has other markets it can look to, and President Xi Jinping's landmark proposal to build a new Silk Road, called the Belt and Road initiative, he said.'We Chinese should not buy Apple phones. Like the saying 'Buy the nation's products, love China', buying domestic products will boost our own industries.''A lot of American goods are actually made in China,' said Wei Shaochuan, 26, the founder of a tech start-up in China's central Henan province, was interviewed on WeChat.'But if, after a period of time, the trade war really incites a sense of hatred against the United States, then I will not watch American movies, not listen to American music, not recommend Disney to friends, and start writing social media posts saying that Americans are not good, in order to counter American cultural products,' he said.'I'm a strong supporter of Chinese products. I'm a firm opponent of any American product, especially after reading the news,' said Zhao Guoxin, 61, a store owner in Beijing. 'The other day I went to this American shop and I told them I won't buy one single thing, and I made them very awkward. To be honest I do think America is pretty obnoxious,' he said.'To be honest, importing from the U.S. isn't our sole route,' said Wang Yangqing, a Beijing nurse who said she was in her 20s. 'We could also import from European countries. For girls, we use some American skin care products. If tariffs keep rising, I may shift to products from other places such as Japan or Korea.''China should strike back properly,' said Xu Dong, 25, a student in Beijing. 'But I won't stop buying their products. Some enterprises like Apple in fact bring in tax revenues and employment. It's a brand that is doing good to China,' he said.'For me it [the trade war] is great!' said Zhu Tao, 34, a ship catering manager in Beijing. 'That's because I receive my salary in U.S. dollars and since the U.S.-China trade war started the U.S. dollar has kept increasing in value compared to the yuan. So I think it has really helped me. It's great!'(Reporting by Beijing and Shanghai newsrooms; Editing by Martin Howell)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The president of the Iowa Soybean Association says, like many other farmers, he has mixed feelings about the U.S. trade dispute with China. Bill Shipley says there are many long-running trade issues with China that needed to be addressed.â€œI agree that we need to take on the inequality of trade we have with China, and I think most farmers do,â€? Shipley says. â€œWe just want a free and open, level market â€“ and they donâ€™t want to do that. They want everything in their favor.â€?But, that resolve to fix trade issues starts to waiver as soybean prices continue to decline. Shipley, who farms nears the southwest Iowa town of Nodaway, says his local cash price for soybeans â€“ assuming average yields â€“ is more than a dollar under his cost of production.â€œThat doesnâ€™t bode well for what my banker thinks, or anybody else,â€? Shipley says. â€œIâ€™m going to have to eat into equity to stay alive â€“ to stay in farming.â€?Shipley is hopeful the two countries can find a resolution to the trade dispute before additional tariffs go into effect July 6.

The country buys about 60-percent of all the soybeans traded in the world.(story courtesy of Radio Iowa)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CALGARY â€“ Canadaâ€™s proposed LNG projects are expected to be more cost competitive than U.S. projects in delivering boatloads of super-cooled natural gas to Asian markets when they are finally built, according to the Canadian Energy Research Institute.CERI president and CEO Allan Fogwill says that proposed LNG facilities on Canadaâ€™s West Coast are capable of delivering the commodity to northern Asian markets for roughly $1 per million cubic feet less than their American competitors, to as low as US$7.54 per mmbtu, compared with US$8.40 for American LNG projects.The cost advantage comes partly from Canadaâ€™s closer proximity to Asia, Fogwill told a business audience Wednesday.Additional advantages have arisen as Beijing and Washington D.C. escalate their tariff war on each otherâ€™s products. China slapped 10 per cent tariffs on LNG imports from the U.S. on Tuesday as a trade war escalates between the two countries.China is currently the worldâ€™s third-largest importer of LNG but the countryâ€™s current five-year plan calls for rapidly increasing the use of natural gas in its energy mix. As a result, China is on pace to surpass South Korea and Japan to become the largest market for LNG in the world in the next few years.â€œIn the 12 months up until June 2018, China was the second-largest buyer of U.S. LNG, accounting for approximately three (million tonnes per year), with (Royal Dutch) Shell being the largest seller,â€? Wood Mackenzie research director Giles Farrer said in a note following the tariff implementation.He said that Chinese buyers have reduced purchases of LNG from the U.S. over the summer months as U.S. President Donald Trump hit the country with tariffs and China responded with tariffs of its own.The latest Chinese tariff target â€“ LNG â€“ could affect the development of new U.S. natural gas export projects.â€œIt restricts the target market for developers of new U.S. LNG projects trying to sign new long-term contracts,â€? Farrer said. â€œHowever, there is still plenty of appetite for second-wave U.S. LNG projects from other buyers in Asia and Europe, as evidenced by recent contracting momentum at Freeport, Calcasieu Pass and Sabine Pass Train 6.â€?Meanwhile, Canadian LNG proponents have yet to proceed with any large-scale developments, though Pieridae Energy Ltd., Woodfibre LNG and Shell Canada-led LNG Canada are all expected to decide on their projects before the end of this year.FortisBC shipped the first-ever batch of Canadian LNG to China in November 2017. Since then, the company has sent additional smaller shipments of the commodity to Asian markets via its LNG facility outside Vancouver.Shellâ€™s LNG Canada project could, on its own, â€œfixâ€? depressed Canadian domestic natural gas markets, Stream Asset Financial principal and chief market strategist Dan Tsubouchi said in an energy outlook presentation on Tuesday.If the government of Canada wants to see projects go ahead, they need to address every single barrier in the way Ken Hughes, former Alberta energy ministerTransCanada Corp. announced last week it had signed agreements with every elected First Nations band along the route of the pipeline from B.C.â€™s gas fields to the LNG Canada project, which analysts consider another sign the project is close to moving forward.Tsubouchi said heâ€™s also optimistic that the project will proceed in part because of Chinaâ€™s aggressive push to reduce its reliance on coal-fired power by increasing its use of natural gas, which has caused a major structural change in the global LNG market.â€œChina needs to increase its natural gas imports by almost three bcfd per year for the next decade. So to put that into perspective, thatâ€™s equivalent to five Cheniere LNG trains every year or the four-train LNG Canada development every year,â€? Tsubouchi said.However, project delays and outright cancellations have led to mounting frustrations within the domestic energy sector.Ken Hughes, former Alberta energy minister, says Canada can take advantage of the surging LNG demand.â€œIf the government of Canada wants to see projects go ahead, they need to address every single barrier in the way, including regulatory and tariffs and legislative barriers that currently exist,â€? Hughes said, adding that â€œCanada needs to get its act together.â€?â€¢ Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Trade war. Surely the clue is in the name. Incredible as it may seem, the United States has just declared war. Not on adversaries like North Korea, Iran or Russia. Instead it has declared war on Europe, on Britain. The modern world has lost the habit of thinking in a historical way about free trade.Todayâ€™s global economy has been predicated for more than half a century on open international markets. Through most of that period, arguments over trade have been arguments about good forms of free trade â€” such as the tariff-free flow of products that boosts prosperity all round â€” versus the bad forms â€” such as lower labour standards, tax avoidance or the undermining of public institutions.As a result, perhaps we have forgotten that the alternative to trade peace is not only trade war, but sometimes war itself.In an abstract sense, Donald Trump may have been right to invoke national security this week when he slapped a 25 per cent tariff on European and Canadian steel and 10% on aluminium. â€œEconomic security is military security,â€? declared the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross. That remark echoes Adam Smithâ€™s celebrated observation in the 18th century that defence was more important than opulence.Trade and national security are indeed umbilically linked. Each provides the conditions and stability necessary for the other. But trade can also be used as a weapon of war when states are enemies. Smith lived in a Europe where trade and military conflicts often overlapped. We donâ€™t â€” at least not recently and not yet. Neither Europe nor Canada is in reality an enemy of the US. With China, itâ€™s not so clear.Over a century ago, in June 1904, 10,000 people gathered at Alexandra Palace in north London. They were there to mark the centenary of the birth â€” the 214th anniversary falls tomorrow â€” of Richard Cobden, the anti-corn lawBut the main speech was given by the Liberal leader and later prime minister, Henry Campbell-Bannerman. â€œWe stand today at the parting of the ways,â€? he told the crowd. â€œOne road â€” a broad and easy one â€” leads to protection, to conscription, to the reducing of free institutions to a mere name ... The other road leads to the consolidation of liberty and the development of equity at home, and to treaties of arbitration and amity, with their natural sequences in the arrest and ultimate reduction of armaments, and the lightening of taxation, which presses upon our trade and grinds the faces of the poor.â€?Over the decades that followed, that centrality gradually disappeared. Britain ceased to shape the global trading system as it had done in the 19th century. Public services were consolidated in the aftermath of war, not in conditions of unending peace. But Campbell-Bannermanâ€™s two roads â€” one of free trade, peace and growing equality, one of protection, war and inequality â€” were real choices then and remain real choices today.Trump has chosen his road. He has forced his trade partners to respond in like terms. But the disruption that he has deliberately inflicted on Europe marks a turning point. It declares us Americaâ€™s enemies. In Britain, it tells us that the Atlantic alliance is at risk of becoming a chimera. It makes a mockery of the Brexitersâ€™ vision of a buoyant free trade deal with the US. Thatâ€™s nothing but self-deceiving fantasy now. And, as Campbell-Bannerman would have recognised, it makes clear that we are Europeans.The consequence of free trade is the binding of nations together. We will have to see what the consequences of Trumpâ€™s move are â€” but the precedents do not inspire hope.â€” Guardian News & Media Ltd, 2018Martin Kettle is a Guardian staff columnist",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the worldâ€™s largest economies stumble toward an all-out trade war, President Donald Trump is tweeting in all-caps, but carrying a small stick.After White House chief economic adviser Gary Cohn announced heâ€™s resigning, the Trump administration is considering tariffs on a range of Chinese imports from shoes and clothing to consumer electronics, people familiar with the matter told Andrew Mayeda and Jennifer Jacobs of Bloomberg News. China â€œwill take necessary measuresâ€? if its interests are harmed, Vice-Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui said.Which side has the divisions best-arrayed to bring victory in this conflict?One lesson from real warfare is that battles tend to be won and lost on the home front â€“ and in that respect, the U.S. is laboring under a significant handicap. Its major imports from China are overwhelmingly consumer goods, where the predictable effect of tariffs will be to increase costs to American citizens, as Gadflyâ€™s Tim Culpan points out. The largest categories are computers, phones, knitwear, other clothing, and toys.It wonâ€™t be easy for U.S. retailers to replace these goods. In every one of the consumer sectors where Chinese exports to the U.S. were worth more than USD5 billion in 2016, China accounted for more than one-third of U.S. imports by value. Global supply chains canâ€™t source from rival regions fast enough to avoid a tax on shoppersâ€™ wallets, should further tariffs be imposed.The ideal solution, from Trumpâ€™s perspective, would be for domestic production to come to the rescue â€“ but that horse has long bolted.In clothing manufacturing, the U.S. production-line workforce has shrunk by more than 90 percent since 1990, and the electronics industry has lost almost 40 percent of its jobs. With China itself seeing industries quitting for cheaper locations in South and Southeast Asia and Africa, the chances of those jobs coming back to the U.S. are slim.By contrast, China imports mainly intermediate products and parts from the U.S., led by soybeans, aircraft, cars, integrated circuits and plastic. The cost of any retaliatory tariffs on those products will pass through a number of producers before any citizens feel it in their hip pockets â€“ and dictatorships donâ€™t have to worry so much about popular backlash, anyway.If Xi Jinping chooses to fight back, watch what happens to the semiconductor industry. A quarter of U.S. chip exports go to China, but that constitutes just 3.8 percent of the Peopleâ€™s Republicâ€™s total imports of integrated circuits. A relatively small shift in Chinese business patterns could deliver a devastating blow to one of Americaâ€™s most successful export trades.Soybeans, too, could come in the firing line. China swallows up more than 60 percent of Americaâ€™s exports of the legume, but that trade accounts for only 12 percent or so of Chinese consumption, at least as measured by domestic production plus imports. Putting levies on those imports will turn up the heat at a time when global soybean prices are at a two-year high, raising pressure on the processors and farmers who use soy for animal feed â€“ but prices for pork, the most critical end-use sector in China, have been declining for 12 straight months, so they could afford to rise a little.The smarter move for China might be to stand pat. Despite Xiâ€™s boasts at Davos and elsewhere, the countryâ€™s record on free trade is dismal, a potential handicap if matters degenerate into a wider trade war. The better policy would be to let Trump raise costs for American consumers with ill-advised tariffs; refuse to retaliate; then pose as the innocent victim.Governments in Washingtonâ€™s sphere of influence, motivated by strategic investments in the likes of Deutsche Bank AG and Brazilian utility CPFL Energia SA and taken aback by Trumpâ€™s aggressive stance, may be persuaded to regard Beijing as the friendlier ally.That would be the greater victory for a Chinese president without term limits and with a view to posterity: To subdue the enemy without fighting, as the Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu wrote, is the supreme art of war.

"Washington has invited Beijing to hold new talks on their escalating tariff dispute, the Chinese foreign ministry said yesterday, ahead of a decision by President Donald Trump on whether to raise duties on USD200 billion of Chinese imports.The announcement followed reports by American and European chambers of commerce that foreign companies in China have been hurt by earlier tariff hikes by both sides in the fight over Beijingâ€™s technology policy.â€œWe have indeed received an invitation from the U.S. side. We welcome it,â€? said a ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang. â€œNow the two sides are in communication on relevant details.â€?Envoys from the two countries last met Aug. 22 in Washington but reported no progress.Beijing has rejected pressure from the United States to roll back plans for state-led development of Chinese global champions in robotics, artificial intelligence and other fields.Washington, Europe and other trading partners say those plans violate Chinaâ€™s market-opening commitments. American officials also worry they might erode U.S. industrial leadership.The two governments have imposed 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of each otherâ€™s goods.Two-thirds of American companies that responded to a survey said they have suffered lost sales or lower profits due to that increase, two chambers of commerce reported.More companies say they will suffer if Trump goes ahead with his planned tariff hike and Beijing retaliates, according to the American Chambers of Commerce in China and in Shanghai.In addition to retaliatory tariffs, companies report China is slowing down customs clearances and stepping up inspections and other bureaucratic processes, the chambers said.Forecasters have warned that the worsening conflict between the worldâ€™s two biggest traders could cut up to 0.5 percentage point off global economic growth through 2020 if all threatened tariff hikes go ahead.â€œAmerican companies are suffering both from Chinaâ€™s retaliatory tariffs, and â€” ironically â€” from U.S. tariffs designed to harm the Chinese economy,â€? the two chambers said in a statement. â€œAmCham China and AmCham Shanghai urge both governments to return to the negotiating table.â€?Beijing has issued a list of $60 billion of American products for retaliation if Trumpâ€™s next tariff hike goes ahead.The chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China warned the Trump administration might be underestimating Chinaâ€™s resolve to fight back.â€œThe U.S. administration runs the risk of a downward spiral of attack and counterattack, benefiting no one,â€? William Zarit said in the statement.To avoid the tariffs, 30 percent of U.S. companies are looking at moving assembly out of the United States or China or finding new suppliers, the chambers said. They said nearly one-third are thinking about canceling or postponing investment decisions.Also yesterday, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said one in six of its members that responded to a survey are delaying investment or expansion. It said the conflict is â€œcausing significant disruptions to global supply chains.â€?China is running out of American imports for retaliation due to their lopsided trade balance, but threatened unspecified â€œcomprehensive measuresâ€? in June. That prompted worries it would use regulatory controls to disrupt U.S. business operations in China.Another business group, the U.S.-China Business Council, said this week Chinese officials told it they were postponing accepting license applications from American companies in financial services and other fields until relations improve.Some 63.6 percent of more than 430 companies that responded to the American chambersâ€™ survey said profits and customer demand have fallen due to the U.S. tariffs and 62.5 percent said the same about retaliatory Chinese tariffs.About 74.3 percent said they would be affected if Washingtonâ€™s tariff increase on $200 billion of Chinese goods goes ahead. Some 67.6 percent said the same of Chinaâ€™s planned retaliatory tariffs on $60 of American goods.The survey was conducted between Aug. 29 and Sept. 5.Some 52.1 percent of companies said Chinese authorities are slowing customs clearances, increasing inspections or imposing other â€œqualitative measures.â€?The European chamber said about 5 percent of companies reported shifting production out of the United States and about 7 percent were moving out of China.That shows â€œneither side is â€˜winning,â€™â€? because â€œboth are equally prone to losing companies,â€? the chamber said.China has tried without success to recruit Germany, France, South Korea and other governments as allies against Washington. Some of them have criticized Trumpâ€™s tactics but many echo U.S. complaints about Chinese market barriers and industrial strategy.â€œWe share the concerns of the U.S. regarding Chinaâ€™s trade and investment practices, but continuing along the path of tariff escalation is extremely dangerous,â€? the European chamber president, Mats Harborn, said in a statement.

"AP Photo/David ZalubowskiNewell Brands said it expects President Donald Trump's trade war to cost it $100 million every year.That could mean more expensive Crock-Pots, Coleman stoves, and Sharpie markers.The warning came on the company's earnings call Monday, where it also cut its guidance for the fourth straight quarter.Follow Newell's stock price in real-time hereShares of Newell Brands â€” the company behind iconic names like Crock-Pot, Rubbermaid, Yankee Candle, and Sharpie â€” fell as much as 15% Monday after the company warned it expects to feel a $100 million impact from President Trump's quickly escalating trade war.'As the tariffs currently stand, the annualized impact on Newell Brands could be as much as $100 million,' Michael Polk, the company's chief executive, told investors on an earnings call following Newell's second-quarter earnings report.Despite beating Wall Street estimates for the second quarter â€” earning $0.82 where analysts had expected $0.78 â€” Newell missed on expected revenues by about 2.7% and also cut it's guidance for the fourth time this year.When pressed for specifics on which brands or products would be affected most by tariffs from Europe and China, Polk said it was too early to tell.'I think it's too early to know exactly how much of the pricing will land but we're not going to hesitate to take the price up,' he said.An inventory shift at office-supply chains like Office Depot and Staples should also help to mitigate the potential drawbacks of a trade war. Sharpie and other writing products, more of which are now being sold online instead of distributed through big box chains, are some of Newell's highest-margin items, Polk said. Other hits include outdoor brands like Marmot and Coleman.'We're living through an incredible period of change,' Polk said. 'The disruptions we're experiencing present challenges but as importantly, new opportunities for our businesses and our people. Through this turbulence, our strategy remains unchanged.'Markets Insider",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Steel trade wars could be about to hit your pocket as the world considers its options in reaction to Trump (Picture: Getty)If you think that the worldâ€™s imminent trade war over steel tariffs wonâ€™t affect you then you are sorely mistaken.It is highly likely that everyday items will go up in place as countries and trading bodies react to the huge 25 per cent levy Trump imposed.Immediate reaction came from the EU, Canada and Mexico who have all promised to react quickly against US exports.The EU has threatened to add higher levies on:Kentucky bourbon (think Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort)Blue jeans (Levis)Motorcycles (Harley Davidsons)Orange juicePeanut butterCanada is considering tariffs on:SteelYoghurtToilet paperMexico is considering reacting by penalising imports of:PorkApplesGrapesCheesesFlat steelPeanut butter could be hit under plans being considered by the European Union (Picture: Getty)The import duties threaten to drive up prices for American consumers and companies and are likely to heighten uncertainty for businesses and investors around the globe.AdvertisementAdvertisementCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the tariffs â€“ 25 per cent on imported steel, 10 per cent on aluminium â€“ would take effect on Friday.President Donald Trump had originally imposed the tariffs in March, saying a reliance on imported metals threatened national security. But he exempted Canada, Mexico and the European Union to buy time for negotiations â€“ a reprieve that expired at midnight on Thursday.Other countries, including Japan, Americaâ€™s closest ally in Asia, are already paying the tariffs.The administrationâ€™s actions drew fire from Europe, Canada and Mexico and promises to quickly retaliate against US exports.Donald Trump put a massive 25 per cent levy on steel and the world is considering how to react (Picture: Getty)â€˜This is protectionism, pure and simple,â€™ said Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission.French president Emmanuel Macron called the US decision to levy tariffs on the European Union â€˜illegalâ€™ and a â€˜mistakeâ€™.He ominously recalled the pre-Second World War period saying, â€˜Economic nationalism leads to war. This is exactly what happened in the 1930s.â€™David Oâ€™Sullivan, the EUâ€™s ambassador in Washington, said the retaliation will probably be announced in late June.Mexico complained that the tariffs will â€˜distort international tradeâ€™.In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: â€˜These tariffs are totally unacceptable.â€™Many have called Trumpâ€™s tariffs unacceptable as the world weighs up its options (Picture: EPA)Canada announced plans to slap tariffs on 12.8 billion dollars-worth (Â£9.65 billion) of US products.â€˜Canada is a secure supplier of aluminium and steel to the US defence industry, putting aluminium in American planes and steel in American tanks,â€™ Mr Trudeau said.AdvertisementAdvertisementâ€˜That Canada could be considered a national security threat to the United States is inconceivable.â€™Mr Trump had campaigned for president on a promise to crack down on trading partners that he said exploited poorly negotiated trade agreements to run up big trade surpluses with the US.The US tariffs coincide with â€“ and could complicate â€“ the Trump administrationâ€™s separate fight over Beijingâ€™s strong-arm tactics to overtake US technological supremacy.Mr Ross is leaving on Friday for Beijing for talks aimed at preventing a trade war with China.The worldâ€™s two biggest economies have threatened to impose tariffs on up to 200 billion dollars-worth (Â£150 billion) of each otherâ€™s products.The steel and aluminum tariffs could also complicate the administrationâ€™s efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Canada and Mexico, a pact that Mr Trump has condemned as a job-killing â€˜disasterâ€™.The White House released a statement from Mr Trump on Thursday night saying of Nafta, â€˜Earlier today, this message was conveyed to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada: The United State (sic) will agree to a fair deal, or there will be no deal at all.â€™Mr Trump had offered the two US neighbours a permanent exemption from the steel and aluminium tariffs if they agreed to US demands on Nafta. But the Nafta talks stalled.Mr Ross said there was â€˜no longer a very precise date when they may be concludedâ€™, and that as a result, Canada and Mexico were added to the list of countries hit with tariffs.AdvertisementLikewise, the Trump trade team sought to use the tariff threat to pressure Europe into reducing barriers to US products. But the two sides could not reach an agreement.The import duties will give a boost to American makers of steel and aluminum by making foreign metals more expensive. But companies in the US that use imported steel will face higher costs.And the tariffs will allow domestic steel and aluminium producers to raise prices, squeezing companies â€“ from car makers to can producers â€“ that buy those metals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subscribe here.Thursdayâ€™s dispatch: What to know about Trumpâ€™s new Chinese tariffsPresident Donald Trump is expected to target the Chinese technology sector on Thursday with new tariffs that discourage theft of American inventions. Trump may restrict Chinese investment in the U.S. and raise the cost on high-tech products manufactured in the country.The U.S. plans to justify the tariffs as a message to China over intellectual property theft. Trumpâ€™s advisers argue American companies have lost thousands of jobs and billions of dollars to Chinese companies that have stolen their ideas. For example, Sinovel was convicted in January of stealing American wind turbine secrets. Members of the Trump administration, such as U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, argue those companies and China must be punished. â€œWe are losing [revenue] to China in ways that are not reflective of the underlying economics,â€? Lighthizer told the House on Wednesday.The move is the latest in Trumpâ€™s pivot to aggressive trade policy in 2018. To the chagrin of most Republicans and Democrats in Congress, Trump imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum earlier this month. He promised during the 2016 campaign to pursue trade measures that would favor American over foreign workers, even though history shows tariffs have been disastrous for the United States.Trump is expected to announce tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese goods, about 10% all of goods China sent to the United States in 2017. China has promised to retaliate, potentially by imposing tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports, if Trump follows through on his plan.These moves could spark a standoff between the U.S. and China, which sends more goods to the U.S. than any other country. And American consumers would be caught in the middle â€” for example, a Chinese tariff on agricultural imports from the U.S. could devastate American farmers.The tariffs show Trump is willing to risk a trade war, which China and other countries have threatened, to protect U.S. workers. Trump and his supporters are betting that such protection will be a politically popular pitch, though steel and aluminum tariffs seemed to do little to boost a Republican running for Congress in southeastern Pennsylvania earlier in March. In fact, Republican Rick Saccone officially conceded to Democrat Conor Lamb on Wednesday night.Meanwhile, Trump has already shown a willingness to compromise on tariffs as part of his foreign policy strategy. Lighthizer told Congress on Wednesday that the United States is close to reaching a deal with several U.S. allies to exempt them from steel and aluminium tariffs. Brazil and South Korea could both receive exemptions, as Canada and Mexico already have.Todayâ€™s question: Do you support tariffs on China and companies that steal from U.S. companies?Please email us at trumpsamerica@mic.com with your thoughts.Thursday in Trumpâ€™s America:Budget: Lawmakers have given themselves two days to fund the government through the rest of this year. The more than 2,200 page bill will be voted Thursday by the House and Friday in the Senate. It is expected to pass.The deal allocates $1.6 billion to Trumpâ€™s border wall â€” far below the $25 billion the White House wanted. It does not increase spending on new immigration agents or holding beds for undocumented immigrants. And it increases military spending by the most in 15 years, while allocating $21 billion to infrastructure projects, including a tunnel between New York and New Jersey that Trump did not want the government to fund. The bill also has deep cuts to foreign aid, but it does not cut the Environmental Protection Agency, Pell Grants or affordable housing programs.Biden: Former Vice President Joe Biden said Tuesday he would have â€œbeaten the hellâ€? out of Trump in high school for his treatment of women. That echoed Bidenâ€™s comment during the 2016 campaign, when he said, â€œI wish we were in high school â€” I could take him behind the gym.â€?Trump responded by tweeting, â€?[Biden] would go down fast and hard, crying all the way.

"Chinaâ€™s leaders must redouble their efforts to unleash the â€œanimal spiritsâ€? of domestic businesses, while spurring local governments to spearhead reformsHONG KONG â€“ Last June, The Economist lamented that â€œDonald Trump is undermining the rules-based international order,â€? as he seeks â€œshort-term wins for Americaâ€? at the cost of â€œlong-term damage to the world.â€? With Trump now escalating his trade war with Chinaâ€”and with both sides seeming to be girding for protracted competition over technological leadershipâ€”the threat is only growing.For a long time, trade appeared to benefit everyone. This assumption underpinned a broad global consensus on trade rules, including the relatively consistent protection of property rights. China, for example, has managed to integrate itself into the global economy because its firms learned how to operate and compete within the framework established by the World Trade Organization.But, as the Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz has repeatedly pointed out, the neoliberal obsession with unfettered markets failed to account for the distributive costs of efficiency gains. Inequality has risen sharply, spurring many populations to become increasingly disillusioned not just with the specific factors fueling it, but with openness and globalization in virtually all its forms, including immigration and free trade.That is how Trump got elected. But the backlash is not exclusive to the US. The United Kingdomâ€™s vote to leave the European Union was driven by similar concerns, as has been the rise of right-wing populist political forces in many EU countries, from Italy to Poland. These political developmentsâ€”and they are political, not economicâ€”have spurred a process of re-writing, if not dismantling, the existing rules-based world order.This is forcing profound transformation at the national and international levels. But, as Stiglitz and Harvardâ€™s David Kennedy wrote in the 2013 book Law and Economics with Chinese Characteristics, â€œmarkets are built upon a foundation of legal arrangements and stabilized by a regulatory framework.â€? This means that addressing the distributive effects of market failures requires the construction of new judicial, administrative, and regulatory frameworksâ€”a process that will take time.Chinaâ€”a favorite target of those who are attacking the rules-based global orderâ€”is under particularly intense pressure to make changes. Because its market grew faster than its tax, regulatory, and judicial arrangements could evolve, the country was beset by rising income inequality, pollution, financial risks, and corruptionâ€”all of which must be addressed in the next phase of structural reforms.What precisely those reforms should be, however, remains subject to heated debate among Chinaâ€™s elites, policymakers, and disadvantaged groups, as well as foreign stakeholders. And as the trade war with the US continues to escalate, calls for policy clarity are growing more urgent.Chinaâ€™s entrepreneurs and its rapidly expanding middle class are concerned, first and foremost, about their property rights, including the security of their accumulated wealth, amid regulatory tightening with regard to taxation, finance, cross-border capital flows, and even the environment. Meanwhile, Chinese young people and low-income households worry about high and rising home prices, job insecurity, and the fast-growing market power of a few tech giants squeezing small and medium-size enterprises.For their part, foreign businesses operating in China, as well as trade partners like the US, are focusing on inadequate protection of intellectual property rights, excessive government support of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and an industrial policy geared toward technological upgrading. Policymaking in this area here would also need to account for the disruptive impact of new technologies on business models, supply chains, lifestyles, and even politics within China.It is imperative that Chinaâ€™s leaders mount a firm and decisive response to these divergent and sometimes even conflicting concerns. This means pursuing a set of bold reforms that not only bolster confidence, but also strengthen Chinaâ€™s hand in negotiations with the US and foreign investors.The first step for China should be to reaffirm the authoritiesâ€™ 2013 commitment to ensuring that markets play a decisive role in allocating resources. If this commitment is to be credible, however, China must follow up by creating a level playing field for market competition among foreign companies, private Chinese firms, and SOEs.The good news is that far-reaching reforms can actually be easier to justify during periods of uncertainty, transition, or even crisis. Yet one important current factor could impede such action: risk-aversion on the part of local officials.In the past, local-level experimentation and innovation have proved integral to Chinaâ€™s progress, with competition among provinces, cities, and firms often helping the country to break out of bureaucratic and structural logjams. But, having watched as President Xi Jinpingâ€™s anti-corruption campaign has taken down their colleagues and bosses, many local officials now hesitate to pursue daring initiatives.Much as Deng Xiaoping did with his 1992 â€œsouth China tour,â€? Chinaâ€™s leaders today must redouble their efforts to unleash the â€œanimal spiritsâ€? of domestic businesses, while spurring local governments to spearhead their own reforms. Although trading partners like the US may object to the state-led nature of this approach, the end result will be more stable and dynamic markets.The key to success will be to strengthen the infrastructure of property-rights protection, including dispute-resolution mechanisms, the court system, and commercial and technological standards. To this end, the authorities would do well to look to the property-rights infrastructure in Hong Kong, the US, the UK, and elsewhere in Europe, which has remained stable and robust, despite political and social upheaval.China has only limited influence over the evolutionâ€”or even survivalâ€”of the rules-based world order. But, by bringing its property-rights arrangements into line with those of the advanced economies, it can support shared prosperity and mutually beneficial engagement, potentially defusing some of the tensions that have lately been fueling instability worldwide.Andrew Sheng is Distinguished Fellow of the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong and a member of the UNEP Advisory Council on Sustainable Finance.

"European investors pulled cash from mutual funds at the fastest rate in almost five years in June, withdrawing â‚¬38.3 billion as fears of a global trade war spooked markets.Equity, bond and money market funds based in Europe all suffered at least â‚¬11 billion in net outflows during the month, marking it the worst month for redemptions since September 2013, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper, the data provider.The investor flight came as the White House outlined plans to impose tariffs on imports from China, rattling markets and prompting fears that a trade war could threaten global supply chains.Brussels will make a last-ditch attempt to convince US president Donald Trump not to go ahead with punitive tariffs on the EU car sector even as hopes diminish that a full-blown trade war with the US can be avoided.Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, will meet Mr Trump in Washington DC on Wednesday, in a meeting that EU officials said would be aimed at â€œde-escalatingâ€? tensions by exploring â€œvarious avenuesâ€? for trade talks.â€˜Error of his waysâ€™Meanwhile, Irelandâ€™s EU commissioner Phil Hogan said the EU must respond to Mr Trumpâ€™s trade policies by â€œbullyingâ€? him back.It is only by adopting a hard-line approach towards the US that Mr Trump could be shown â€œthe error of his waysâ€?, Mr Hogan told the opening session of the MacGill Summer School in Donegal on Monday morning.Detlef Glow, head of Lipper Europe, Middle East and Africa research, said heightened insecurity had prompted the outflows of funds, with investors fearing â€œpossible trade wars and the increasing political controversy between Iran and the US, which can lead to higher energy prices and, therefore, higher costs for companiesâ€?.â€œSome of the outflows can be seen as a switch into risk-off mode by the European investors,â€? he said.Ben Seager-Scott, chief investment strategist at Tilney, a financial planning company, said many investors had experienced several years of strong growth across their portfolios but were now concerned about potential losses. â€œThere is elevated political risk now. There is concern about trade wars and currency risk.

"WASHINGTON DC, July 25: The Trump administration has extended $12 billion in emergency financial assistance to farmers negatively affected by the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, among others, Politico reported Tuesday.With tens of billions of dollars in tariffs already in effect and the possibility of tariffs on exports worth hundreds of billions of dollars on the table, a number of American industries are on edge. Producers of U.S. agricultural products, a key industry and major U.S. export, are already starting to feel the pressure as Beijing purposefully targets an important constituency for President Donald Trump.Soybean farmers in particular have taken a hit, with prices dropping as China imposes retaliatory tariffs on U.S. farm products. In June, soybean prices dropped to a nine-year low,according to CNBC.â€œThe actions today are a firm statement that other nations cannot bully our agricultural producers to force the United States to cave in,â€? Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue saidTuesday as the assistance program was announced, â€œThis administration will not stand by while our hard-working agricultural producers bear the brunt of unfriendly and illegal tariffs.â€?The aid will be distributed to U.S. farmers through three different mechanisms managed by the Department of Agriculture, The Washington Post reported Tuesday. The three programs will apparently include direct assistance, a trade promotion program, and a food purchase and distribution program. Based on policies from the Great Depression, the assistance plan, which has been in the works for month, will not require congressional approval.The president previously directed Perdue to develop solutions to protect agricultural workers from any unintended fallout from U.S. trade disputes with foreign countries. â€œFarmers are resilient. They understand that China has not been playing fair,â€? Perdue toldCNBC last month, â€œThey are patriots, but they also know that patriotism canâ€™t pay the bills and thatâ€™s where they are concerned.â€?The trade war between the U.S. and China has been escalating for months, and tensions are also rising between the U.S. and the European Union over long-standing trade issues.Failed negotiations and threats have started to evolve into punitive policies, especially when it comes to Americaâ€™s dealings with Beijing.The president said last week that he is ready to place tariffs on all $500 billion worth of Chinese exports to the U.S. â€œIâ€™m not doing this for politics, Iâ€™m doing this to do the right thing for our country.

"WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ Iran under Ayatollah Khomeini, Ghadaffiâ€™s Libya and, now, Canada.All have had exports to the U.S. targeted by an obscure national-security trade penalty, U.S. Sen. Todd Young noted Thursday as both Republicans and Democrats on the Senate foreign-relations committee slammed President Donald Trumpâ€™s confrontational trade policy.At a committee hearing with administration officials and business leaders, members repeatedly questioned the notion that Canada poses a risk to America, as implied by Trumpâ€™s use of the â€œsection 232â€? national-security provision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada and other countries.Trumpâ€™s multi-front trade war, they charged, is killing jobs in the U.S. and driving friends away, just when theyâ€™re needed to counter the real economic menace: China.The committeeâ€™s outspoken chairman, Republican Bob Corker, also revealed that White House sources have hinted Trump may put off signing a new deal on NAFTA with Canada and Mexico until after the midterm congressional elections in November.Administration officials also suggested senators delay their fight against the national-security tariffs imposed on Canada and others until then, which he said suggests the trade machinations are largely political.â€œItâ€™s not just an abuse of power â€¦ itâ€™s also, I know, offensive to the Canadian people,â€? Corker told the National Post later about the steel tariffs.â€œI donâ€™t think this administration understands how fortunate we are to have the neighbours we have,â€? he said. â€œTo be sticking a stick in the eye of our closest friends and abusing authorities, and maybe doing it for political purposes, is offensive to those of us here (too).â€?Much of the hearing focused on the national-security tariffs, which the president was allowed to impose without Congressâ€™s usual say over trade measures. Young, a Republican from Indiana, noted the only time section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act was wielded before this year was to ban oil imports from Iran after the 1979 Islamic revolution and from Libya in 1982 because of its support of terrorism.â€œFrom a foreign policy perspective,â€? said Young, â€œI see an important distinction between 1979 Iran and Canada today.â€?The first witness at the hearing was Manisha Singh, a career State Department official whom one senator suggested had been dispatched as â€œcannon fodder.â€?She grimly fielded a barrage of mostly hostile questions, arguing the national-security tariffs were not meant to target any one nation, but to bolster a steel and aluminum sector thatâ€™s crucial to Americaâ€™s defence.â€œPresident Trump has determined that the 232 actions are necessary to preserve the vitality of our domestic industries.â€?When Corker suggested that the U.S. exports more steel to Canada than the other way around, Singh said Canada was not considered a security threat.That prompted Bob Menendez, the committeeâ€™s ranking Democrat, to question how Trump could then justify using the national-security tariffs.He went on to ask if the U.S. had a formal military-production accord with Canada. Singh said she didnâ€™t know.â€œThe answer is yes,â€? Menendez added. â€œWe say that itâ€™s a national-security threat at the same time itâ€™s in the midst of producing defence elements for us.â€?The Senate on Wednesday passed a non-binding resolution calling on the administration to obtain congressional input before using the national-security clause. But Corker has twice failed to get support for a bill that would make getting Congressâ€™s approval mandatory.He said administration officials have â€œsent signalsâ€? that senators should hold off on that push until after the midterm elections, and intimated that renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement could also be delayed until Americans have voted in November. Formal, face-to-face NAFTA talks have been on hold for weeks.But Corker said itâ€™s difficult to tell what the White House really has in mind.â€œNot a single person has been able to articulate where this is headed,â€? said the senator. â€œIt seems to be a wake up, ready, fire, aim strategy.â€?â€¢ Email: tblackwell@postmedia.com | Twitter: tomblackwellNP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Back in early July 2016, several Post journalists, including myself, sat down with then-candidate Donald Trump and discussed important issues like the economy, his wall, the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton and international trade.Trump told us that if he was elected, he would get tough on the countries that America trades with.I asked if he was worried about a trade war when countries place tariffs â€” taxes â€” on each othersâ€™ products and eventually hurt the worldâ€™s economy.Nope, said Trump, rather cavalierly. He wasnâ€™t worried about that. His America First policy would prevail.This week Trump put tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels, hurting products coming mostly from China and South Korea.Heâ€™s also negotiating changes in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which sets trade rules among the US, Mexico and Canada.Within a few weeks weâ€™ll know if China, especially, retaliates by imposing tariffs on US products entering that country. And weâ€™ll also see if Trump was too casual when he dismissed my question 18 months ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Trump may have lost his chief economic adviser over the trade war heâ€™s hatching with China. It looks, though, like he gained one recruit â€” Charles â€œSmootâ€? Schumer.As in our senior senator and the Democratic leader in the upper chamber. Schumer this week swung behind Trumpâ€™s tariff initiative.What a situation. A Republican president is backed up by the Democratic leader in the Senate, while editorials in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal line up against them.Schumer was nicknamed â€œSmoot Schumerâ€? some years ago for Utahâ€™s Reed Smoot, a notorious protectionist. The Smoot-Hawley tariff act, passed in 1930, helped precipitate the Great Depression.America spent decades overcoming the consequences of the error. Not until Trump, though, did a president win office on such a pointedly protectionist platform.Trump announced last week he was going to start with tariffs on steel and aluminum. It humiliated National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, a free trader. So the ex-No. 2 at Goldman Sachs announced heâ€™s quitting.Cohn, a Democrat, wasnâ€™t the only one opposing the tariffs. Some of the savviest Republicans in Trumpâ€™s informal brain trust, like economist Lawrence Kudlow, have long been warning against tariffs.Smoot Schumer, though, went before the cameras on Tuesday and offered Trump support. â€œThe presidentâ€™s instincts to go after China,â€? he said, â€œare the right thing to do,â€? adding that China had taken â€œterrible advantage of America.â€?Schumerâ€™s backing of Trump strikes me as newsworthy. Particularly because it wasnâ€™t off the cuff. On the contrary, back in 2004 Schumer had taken to the op-ed page of the New York Times to argue for protectionism.His piece ran under the headline â€œSecond Thoughts on Free Trade.â€? The piece raised eyebrows partly because Schumer co-wrote it with a fallen-away veteran of the Reagan White House, Paul Craig Roberts.Free trade, they complained, hadnâ€™t worked out as theyâ€™d hoped. â€œTo call this a â€˜jobless recoveryâ€™ is inaccurate,â€? they wrote. â€œLots of new jobs are being created, just not here in the United States.â€?I once thought it would be the Democrats whoâ€™d pick up the theme. Particularly after Schumer, in 2014, gave at the National Press Club in Washington a speech calling for his party to find a new strategy. He reckoned the Dems had fought the wrong battle by prioritizing ObamaCare, but didnâ€™t say what strategy he wanted. â€œAt some point,â€? I predicted, â€œSenator Schumer is going to come out for protectionism.â€?That was in an editorial in the New York Sun, which I edit. It called protectionism â€œabout the last major policy blunder the Democrats havenâ€™t tried in a big way.â€?The lingo and ideas that Schumer and Roberts used in that piece were echoed in the 2016 campaign, not by the Democrat but by Trump. Racing through the Rust Belt, he made the argument work.That doesnâ€™t mean those of us who favor free trade (as I do) are wrong. It does mean Trump has an electoral mandate to do what he promised the voters.Trump hasnâ€™t even played his ultimate economic-policy trump card â€” monetary policy. That would mean a campaign to end the era of floating exchange rates and currency manipulation.Candidate Trump complained bigly about that problem when he was on the stump. It offers a strategic way to level the playing field for China, America and others, without playing whack-a-mole with tariffs.Once Trump got elected, though, monetary reform was belittled and blocked by, among others, Gary Cohn. Maybe his departure will allow it to be brought to the fore.It may be too late to stave off a trade war, but the acrimony will be tempered in the White House by the presidentâ€™s new cheerleader Smoot Schumer.Lipsky@nysun.com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By Benjamin Fulford, White Dragon Society, May 21, 2018U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s declaration of trade war with just about everybody is really just a case of Trump negotiating a Chapter 11-style bankruptcy for the United States. A kinder way of putting it would be to say that the U.S. is revolting against an international system that has looted its people on behalf of globalist oligarchs. Yet another way of putting it is to say the world is negotiating a replacement for the petro-dollar system. In any case, we can now expect a lot more shouting and bluster, and possibly even the odd nuke or two, as these negotiations proceed.In public, this dispute can be seen in the biggest open split between European powers and the United States since the end of World War 2. We have the leaders of France, Germany, and the EU openly calling for an end to the post-war European/American alliance. The U.S. side, for its part, has publicly threatened sanctions against European countries. Under the surface, a U.S. assassination campaign against disobedient EU leaders is also a good guess.The immediate trigger was Trumpâ€™s decision to leave the Iranian nuclear accord. Of course, anybody who is following what is really going on knows that the Trump decision to leave the Iranian nuclear accord has nothing to do with nuclear weapons and is really about Iranâ€™s announcement that it will sell oil to Europe priced in Euros, not petro-dollars.Let us start by taking a look at how things will proceed on the superficial level. Here Trump is saying, â€œIf you do not buy more from us, we will stop buying from you!â€? He is also saying, â€œIf you stop using petro-dollars to buy Iranian oil, we will prevent any European country doing business with Iran from doing business with us.â€? The Europeans are saying, â€œYou are a deadbeat who is not paying for what you buy, so who cares is you stop buying!â€? They are also saying, â€œWe will punish any European companies who obey your sanctions against Iran.â€?https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-europe/eu-commission-says-launches-measures-to-protect-eu-business-in-iran-idUSKCN1IJ100â€¦The most important threat seen in public has been the U.S. threat to impose sanctions against Germany if they proceed with the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. This pipeline would allow Germany to import more gas directly from Russia instead of having to go through the Khazarian puppet state of the Ukraine. In essence Trump is saying, â€œIf you do not buy gas from us (at a 20% markup), we will stop buying your cars.â€?https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-05-17/trump-gives-merkel-ultimatum-drop-russian-gas-pipeline-or-trade-war-beginshttps://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-05-17/eu-launches-rebellion-against-trumps-iran-sanctions-bans-european-companiesThe elephant in the living room of this EU/American domestic spat is China and its move to replace the Atlantic alliance with a Eurasian alliance that leaves the Anglo-Saxon powers on the periphery of world power. The way things are going now, the Chinese are winning because the EU/U.S. spat has given a big boost to Chinese yuan-denominated oil futures and thus strengthening the petro-yuan as a would-be replacement for the petro-dollar.https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-05-17/china-oil-futures-thundering-action-after-trump-exits-iran-dealThat is probably why Trump chose a NATO meeting to implicitly threaten a shooting war if his trade war with the EU, China, and the rest of the world does not succeed. Here are his comments:â€œâ€˜Will that be successful? I tend to doubt it,â€™ the president told reporters during an appearance with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. â€˜The reason I doubt it is because China has become very spoiled. The European Union has become very spoiled. Other countries have become very spoiled, because they always got 100 percent of whatever they wanted from the United States. â€˜But we canâ€™t allow that to happen anymore,â€™ Trump added.â€?https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/17/trump-says-he-doubts-china-trade-negotiations-will-succeed.htmlHowever, Chinese secret society sources say they are actually playing a much bigger game and that they are pushing forâ€¦â€¦a world government. This Chinese world view is shaped by their history. When China was divided into warring states, the inevitable result was population decline, poverty, and misery. They believe the world now needs to unify, like China once did, in order to end strife and poverty. The problem with this vision, from a Western perspective, of course, is that if the price of world peace is for everybody to become a Chinese slave, then no thanks.However, unless the West can remove the Zionists with their apocalyptic visions from control of Western future planning, then the Chinese alternative becomes increasingly inevitable as time unfolds.That is why the West needs to do something about monotheism and the families that control it. Let us make that clear, there are competing family groups that control what we view as the competing monotheistic religions. We have:1. The Christians, who are controlled mainly by the P2 Freemasons andthe Vatican or the descendants of the Caesars;2. The Jews and the Christian Jewish slaves (evangelical ZionistChristians), who are controlled by the Rothschild etc. familydynasty (self-described descendants of King David);3. The Orthodox Christians, who are ultimately heirs to the traditionof the Greeks and Alexander the Great;4. The Sunni Muslims, who are controlled by a group of descendants ofMohammed, as well as by descendants of the pagan families whocontrol Mecca; and5. The Shia, who are controlled by a different branch of thedescendants of Mohammed as well as by heirs of the Persian empire.Outside of these groups we have the Gnostic Illuminati, who believe that whatever entity created this planet is evil and needs to be overthrown. The other group is the Satanists, who have an amoral vision that allows their members (many of whom have infiltrated the top levels of world power) to do whatever they want, including mass murder, child rape, cannibalism, etc.While these groups have been fighting for world power for a very long time, what they have in common is a vision of an end time when the world will â€œendâ€? and then be replaced by something else.The trick now is to get these various groups to agree to some sort of vision of the future that does not involve Armageddon and the destruction of 90% of humanity. That is what the real fight is about. The financial war over such things as petro-dollars is thus really a war over control of the psychological process of deciding what humanity as a species will do in the future.The White Dragon Society and its allies are pushing an alternative to all of these visions that envisions a massive campaign to end poverty, stop environmental destruction, and set earth life on a path for exponential expansion into the universe.For now, though, in the West what we are seeing is a grassroots movement, including at the middle ranks of the military-industrial-law-enforcement nexus to remove all criminals from power.On this front, the biggest development last week was the resignation of 34 Chilean bishops, ostensibly because of a massive cover-up of child abuse. However, as is often the case, the story given out for public consumption is not the whole story. What we are seeing in Chile is the removal of the group that was ultimately responsible for the â€œdirty war.â€? This group, closely associated with the Nazis and the Bush family, is largely responsible for the Nazi coup in the U.S. that started with 9/11.Pentagon and other sources are saying this mass resignation may lead to the removal of Pope Francis. However, P2 Freemason sources are saying what is really going on is a Christian Church revolt against the Roman families that have controlled Christianity since its creation. That is why the Pope last week installed 14 new cardinals who were not European. The Pope, they say, is planning for a massive campaign in Africa and South America to end poverty and be a counterpart to Chinaâ€™s massive One Belt One Road infrastructure project.The Pope has also publicly declared war on the unregulated casino-type gambling that the Western financial system has degenerated into.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-17/pope-goes-off-on-cds-market-calls-derivatives-ticking-time-bombIn any case, there is a related purge of corrupt actors still continuing inside the U.S. as well. On this front, according to Pentagon sources, there are now more than 30,000 sealed indictments ready to be acted upon soon. The trigger for these arrests may be the publication of emails, etc. that will â€œbust Hillary (Clinton) for underage sex and other crimes.â€?The â€œcabalâ€? is also â€œreeling with low-level attacks after Gina Haspel was confirmed as CIA Director and Trump signed an executive order to release unredacted documents to Congress,â€? the sources say. The Department of Justice Inspector General is also â€œabout to lower the boom with his explosive report of cabal crimes,â€? the sources say.There is also a lot going on in Asia now that a new CIA head has been named. The most dramatic issue is the ongoing probe of corruption in Malaysia. Here the new government of Mahathir Mohamad is leading raids on former government officials that are literally yielding truck loads of cash, jewelry, and other visible signs of corruption. Pentagon sources are saying that ousted Prime Minister Najib Razak â€œhas flipped,â€? and that Trump may â€œvisit Malaysia after his June 12 Singapore summit with fat boy (North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un).â€?The Malaysian corruption investigations are likely to expose the real reasons for the vanishing Malaysian Air Flight 370/17. However, we know part of this operation was aimed at preventing China from gaining access to U.S. semiconductor manufacturing technology. What this means is that while part of this airplane disappearance was criminal, part of it was linked to a Chinese/Western technology battle. Hopefully the world will learn the truth soon.The new CIA chief is also likely to make it possible for a corruption investigation in Japan, too, the Pentagon sources say. Here we have a political system that has degenerated to the point where almost all politicians in office are bribed and blackmailed stooges.The White Dragon Society has asked the Abe government to nationalize the Bank of Japan and use its financial power to benefit the planet. If this offer is not accepted, mass arrests will begin in Japan. Nationalizing the BOJ might be the trigger that finally brings on the â€œevent,â€? or the mass positive changes we are all yearning for.Source: https://benjaminfulford.net/2018/05/22/trumps-universal-trade-war-declaration-is-bringing-events-to-a-head/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition to announcing retaliatory tariffs on C$16.6 billion worth of U.S. exports on Thursday, the Canadian government will also file a challenge to the Trump administrationâ€™s tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel with the World Trade Organization.â€œOn top of the retaliatory measures announced yesterday, the Government of Canada today requested WTO consultations with the United States regarding its imposition of punitive tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium from Canada, and more generally, on the United Statesâ€™ improper use of national security pretexts for protectionist purposes,â€? said Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland in a statement released on Friday.READ MORE:PM pledges to protect Canadian aluminum, steel jobs in light of U.S. tariffsThe statement went on to pledge that Canada will work with the European Union, who also filed a WTO challenge on Friday, as well as other â€œlike-minded countriesâ€? to oppose the tariffs.Hours after the United States said it would impose tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union, Freeland stated that Canada would impose its own tariffs, which would go into effect on July 1 and will stay in effect until the United States lifts its own measures.The Canadian government released two lists this week of American products, proposing a 25 per cent tariff on the first list and 10 per cent on the second. The lists included products such as iron, yogurt, coffee, wired stainless steel, whiskeys and felt-tipped pens.The U.S. has commonly justified the tariffs by citing national security concerns, which both Freeland and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have staunchly dismissed.â€œIt is entirely inappropriate to view any trade with Canada as a national security threat to the United States. Canada is a safe and secure supplier of fairly traded steel and aluminum for U.S. defence and security. Canada is recognized in U.S. law as a part of the U.S. National Technology and Industrial Base related to national defence,â€? said Freeland in the statement.Freeland also pledged to request the establishment of a NAFTA Chapter 20 panel to â€œaddress the United Statesâ€™ violation of NAFTA rules.â€? The statement claims that such a request would also be filed on Friday.The Trump administration first implemented tariffs on steel and aluminum this past March, though granted Mexico and Canada temporary exemptions while in the midst of NAFTA negotiations. Earlier this week, the White House promptly announced that these tariffs would now extend to Canada and Mexico as well.â€œCanada has treated our agricultural business and farmers very poorly for a very long period of time.

"Donald Trumpâ€™s long-standing promise to use import tariffs to try to revive the US steel and aluminum industry was opposed by US economists, labor experts, and even the industries themselvesâ€”but the White House did it anyway. As a result, over 146,000 Americans will lose their jobs, economists estimate.Tariffs might protect some jobs in the US steel industry, but far fewer than the number of jobs that will be lost. Thatâ€™s because steel manufacturers in the US employ far fewer people than industries that make things out of imported steel, like automakers. Just over 400,000 people in the US work in metal-producing jobs, economist Jed Kolko wrote in March. Four and a half million work in jobs that depend on metal.Employers in the other industries are going to have to pay more for materials, making their products costlier and less competitive. This will force them to cut jobs, economists and industry officials say. Hurting US manufacturers even further, the countries hit by the tariffs will also tax imported US products.Republicans in Congress called the tariffs â€œdumbâ€? and â€œdamagingâ€? after the White House announcement, and a US retail industry trade group said they â€œwill raise the cost of doing business for thousands of American companies, including retailers, and will stifle efforts to expand and create jobs.â€?The Trade Partnership, a economic consulting group, estimated in March that five US jobs will be lost for every one saved by the proposed tariffs, or about 146,000 jobs in total. That estimate assumed the USâ€™s partners in the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement, Mexico and Canada, would be exempted from the tariffs.Now the losses are going to be even higher than that earlier estimate, Trade Partnership president Laura Baughman told Quartz, because the tariffs only exempt Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea. â€œWhatâ€™s most alarming now is that imports from Canada and Mexico will also be hurt, increasing consumer and job impacts beyond those we estimated last March,â€? she said.These job losses will be felt throughout the US, Kolkoâ€™s analysis shows, but particularly in the â€œrust beltâ€? states and the deep South, including Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Mississippi.Trump notoriously hates â€œexpertsâ€? and dismisses economic research. But the notion that steel tariffs cause job losses isnâ€™t just an egghead theory; recent history proves how disastrous they are, as Quartz noted last year:In 2002, president George W. Bush imposed tariffs on steel imports for much the same reason as Trumpâ€”combating cheap imports from other countriesâ€”but ended them when the World Trade Organization ruled them illegal. Over the 18 months that the tariffs were imposed, a spike in steel prices put 200,000 workers out of their jobs, according to a study (pdf) paid for by companies who buy steel.The WTO may also rule on the USâ€™s most recent trade tariffs as well, trade specialists said today. But it took the international body 18 months to make that ruling last time, while the jobs affected could be lost much more quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Less than a year ago, Donald Trump was banqueting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing and toasting â€œto a friendship that will only grow stronger and stronger in the many years to come.â€? Now his vice president has pretty much declared China to be be Americaâ€™s Public Enemy No. 1, bolstering an â€œus vs. themâ€? narrative that is also spreading in China.In a speech at a conservative think tank in Washington on Thursday (Oct. 4), Mike Pence raised not just the USâ€™s long-standing gripe against Chinaâ€”the trade deficitâ€”but a host of other criticisms. He said China was interfering in US politics and also using a â€œwhole-of-governmentâ€? approach to mastermind â€œthe wholesale theft of American technology.â€?â€œUsing that stolen technology, the Chinese Communist Party is turning plowshares into swords on a massive scale,â€? he said. The same day as the speech, a Bloomberg report citing intelligence sources said that Chinese military operatives had put a secret â€œbackdoorâ€? chip on motherboards sold to a slew of top US tech companies, and used by US security agencies.Chinaâ€™s military rise, meanwhile, was aimed at preventing the US from coming to the aid of its allies in the Pacific, said Pence.Pence also portrayed the China-US relationship as one in which the US has continually lent a helping hand to China for moral reasonsâ€”only to be disappointed.â€œPrevious administrations made this choice in the hope that freedom in China would expand in all of its formsâ€”not just economically, but politically, with a newfound respect for classical liberal principles, private property, personal liberty, religious freedom â€” the entire family of human rights. But that hope has gone unfulfilled,â€? he said.Penceâ€™s words will lend support to a narrative already taking hold in Chinese state-run media and among armchair analysts, with many suggesting the successive rounds of Trumpâ€™s tariffs are really an effort to contain Chinaâ€™s rise, rather than to address legitimate trade concerns.Chinaâ€™s foreign ministry strongly criticized Penceâ€™s remarks on Friday, calling them â€œmalicious slanderâ€? and created out of â€œthin air.â€? In response to Penceâ€™s repetition of the Trump claim that the US has â€œrebuilt Chinaâ€? over the past quarter-century, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said:Chinaâ€™s development is mainly owed to Chinese peopleâ€™s hard work and its mutually beneficial cooperation with countries around the world instead of othersâ€™ alms and giving. No one can stop the Chinese people from steadfastly marching ahead along the path of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics and making greater achievements. The efforts made by anyone to distort the facts are doomed to be in vain.On Chinaâ€™s Weibo social media platform, a trade war was starting to look like comparatively small potatoes.â€œChina and the US are no longer in a trade war,â€? said one commenter (link in Chinese). â€œSino-US relations have deteriorated sharply, faster than I expected.â€? Another commenter said â€œthe policy of confrontation and blocking has begun.â€?One bemused person asked, if Chinaâ€™s political interference efforts are indeed so formidable, â€œWhy are we in a trade war with the US?â€?Some critical voices used the debate to dig at Beijingâ€™s own political system, wondering how China would have the know-how to interfere in elections elsewhere when it has so little experience of them at home. Others, citing an insert by state-run China Daily in Iowaâ€™s Des Moines Register, agreed with Penceâ€™s charge of interference.Elsewhere in his speech, Pence raised some issues that have long concerned China watchers in the US and elsewhere. These include Chinaâ€™s treatment of minority religious groups and the detention of vast numbers of Uyghur Muslims in the far western Xinjiang region, as well as Beijingâ€™s attempts to influence people beyond its borders. Critics have pointed to Beijingâ€™s monitoring of Chinese students studying abroad; efforts to control how foreign companies allude to Taiwan; and the increasing activity of state-run news organizations overseas. But raising these issues in this forum, combined with a host of other accusations in a fiercely political speech, may not be exactly the advocacy many were hoping for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A Face From The Ancient GalleryThursday. Not quite mid-day. It was probably a little before you stuffed that pie-hole of yours with whatever deep fried goodness passed for your lunch. The President of the United Sates spoke to the nation. He spoke of a military that was at the ready if need be. My defense names rejoiced. This came after first notifying North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in writing that there would be no June 12 meeting between the two in Singapore.The End? Not even close. Stocks rallied around midday, and though closing lower on the day, did manage to reach that second bell trading at levels far closer to the highs than the lows of the session. The president had taken offense to North Korea's open hostility over the past week or so, as the summit neared. Late yesterday, President Trump, while addressing military preparedness, as well as the continuation of economic sanctions did indicate that once the North Korean leader was willing to 'engage in constructive dialogue' that he would be waiting. North Korea too, was quite conciliatory in response. That nation's state media echoed that sentiment back toward the US in a published statement.What's obvious is that the bigger picture is still really US/Chinese trade, and the protection of US intellectual property rights. North Korea would appear to simply be the side show, being used as a prized chip by both President Xi and President Trump. A dangerous chip? Any of you kids remember the Cold War? This could be every day. In fact, in the age of the aggressive algorithm, headline risk is something that hits markets in a fast and furious way. We have discussed that. What if a new Cold war is around the corner, a new 'Cold Trade War'? Better grow some callouses. I use the strength in defense to liquidate my long in Lockheed Martin (LMT) , while enhancing my focus on Raytheon (RTN) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) .Proofing The PortfolioI sat in my office. The clock approached 4 am. That's when the financial news shows finally wake up. Those of us who rise early are pretty much on our own every day until then. I gaze around the office, doing battle with a slight case of writer's cramp. I focus on one of my bookcases. There are several bottles atop that stark piece of furniture, the most prominent, with an easy to read label from my desk is a half empty bottle of Evan Williams Kentucky Bourbon. 86 Proof. I think to myself, how do I line the portfolio with something that is headline proof in an era where the combination of outspoken and volatile political leaders, a twenty-four hour news cycle, and an electronically driven marketplace almost ensure consistent overreaction followed by a reversion to mean at the point of sale?Energy stocks are among this year's top performers, and easily top dog over the past few months. Energy shares may be President Trump-proof, but they are certainly not headline-proof. The whole sector followed the underlying commodity into the hole on Thursday as Russian Oil Minister Alexander Novak indicated that maybe he would like to engage his OPEC counterparts regarding production levels come next month's meeting in Vienna.I quickly thought about Consumer Staples, but they are certainly not tariff-proof. Thought about the bond proxies, but they are certainly not policy-proof. That knocks out taking the dividend route. I looked back at that bookcase. In front of the bottle were some unopened bills. Just sitting there. Eureka!! One firm had already suffered some headline risk, and come out on the other side in better shape. In fact, that firm's staunch enemy would be stiff technical resistance rather than another go-around with the president. You know where I'm going by now, don't you?The Death Star LivesCue The Imperial March. The president used the Post Office to take a shot at Amazon (AMZN) several months back. The stock suffered initially. I know that because I am long the name, and tried (with some minor success) to trade around the event. Amazon shed more than 265 points as March turned into April. We get it. President Trump and Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post probably aren't going to tailgate together on Sunday afternoons this autumn. Can they agree to co-exist? Have they already sort of done so? Amazon may suffer at the mention of being targeted again, but has already shown an unparalleled resiliency. The shares closed last night above $1600 and have been scraping resistance at that level for about a month now.You'll immediately see two things on this chart, both suggest technical control of the name. For one, the share price strictly obeyed a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the September/October 2017 lows through the March 2018 highs. Secondly, as the shares recovered the price colored strictly within the lines painted by the lower chamber of the Pitchfork drawn along the trend provided by the same timeline. Fascinating. Understandable.What this tells me is that the name looks to be at support as provided by the lower trend-line of said Pitchfork. Buy it here? Not so fast, tough guy. The share price has stalled here at this level repeatedly throughout the year, and this is simply too expensive a stock to make a mistake due to haste or a lack of due diligence. AMZN is trading at 80 times forward looking earnings you know.Should a daily MACD that does look poised to recross in a bullish way today propel AMZN above the highs of the year, I would still need to see at least one successful defense of say... the 1615 level by the name before I could endorse an add here. Yes... I would rather give up a few points on purchase price to gain some certainty rather than to buy the shares this close to resistance with no idea if that ceiling will crack.Daring Play... (but not one for me)I am not playing this one along with you. I am long some equity, and though I am often willing to make a sale in the options space in order to raise revenue, names like this pay outsized premiums for options trades simply because they do carry with them extra-ordinary risk. You have been warned.Amazon will report their Q2 numbers on July 25th. As of last night, July 20th $1350 puts were still paying $4.17. Does $417 bucks for nothing seem like easy money? It might, unless the name stumbles into those earnings. Then you'll chew your fingernails off, and you better have $135 grand at the ready. Not an acceptable risk for your average home-gamer. Depends on your version of tolerance for risk. The July 20 $1200's still last paid $1.25.(Raytheon and Amazon are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club.

"SHENZHEN: More than 70 per cent of US firms operating in southern China are considering delaying further investment there and moving some or all of their manufacturing to other countries as the trade war bites into profits, a business survey showed on Monday.US companies operating in China believe they are suffering more from the trade dispute than firms from other countries, according to the poll by the American Chamber of Commerce in South China, which surveyed 219 companies, one-third from the manufacturing sector.Sixty-four per cent of the companies said they were considering relocating production lines to outside of China, but only 1 per cent said they had any plans to establish manufacturing bases in North America.'While more than 70 per cent of the US companies are considering delaying or cancelling investment in China, and relocation of some or all manufacturing out of China, only half of their Chinese counterparts share the same consideration,' the AmCham report said.The trade war is shifting both supply chains and industrial clusters, mostly towards Southeast Asia, the survey found.US companies reported facing increased competition from rivals in Vietnam, Germany and Japan, while Chinese companies said they were facing growing competition from Vietnam, India, the United States and South Korea.Customers are slowing down orders or not placing them at all, Harley Seyedin, president of AmCham South China, told Reuters.'It could very well be that people are holding back on placing orders until times are more certain or it could very well be that they are shifting to other competitors who are willing to offer cheaper products, even sometimes at a loss, in order to get market share,' he said.'One of the most difficult things about market share is once you lose it, it is very hard to get back.'Companies in the wholesale and retail sectors have suffered the most from US tariffs, while agriculture-related businesses have been most hit by Chinese measures, the survey found.The survey was conducted between September 21 and October 10, shortly after the US imposed tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. That prompted Beijing to retaliate with additional tariffs on $60 billion of US products, escalating a tariff war between the world's two largest economies.The US duties are set to rise sharply on January 1.Both Washington and Beijing appear to be digging in for a long battle, though US officials say President Donald Trump would go through with plans to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit next month if it looked like the discussions would be positive.Nearly 80 per cent of the survey respondents said the tariffs have knocked their businesses, with US tariffs having slightly more impact than the Chinese ones.Around 85 per cent of US companies said they have suffered from the combined tariffs, compared with around 70 per cent of their Chinese counterparts. Companies from other countries also reported similar impacts as their American counterparts.The top concern of companies surveyed was the rising cost of goods sold, which resulted in reduced profits. Other concerns included difficulties managing procurement and reduced sales.One-third of companies estimated the trade dispute had reduced business volumes ranging from $1 million to $50 million, while nearly one in 10 manufacturers reported high-volume business losses of $250 million or more.Nearly half the companies surveyed also said there had been an increase in non-tariff barriers, including increased bureaucratic oversight and slower customs clearance. Analysts have warned of such a risk to US firms as China is increasingly unable to match US measures on a dollar for dollar basis.The survey's findings add to evidence that export-reliant Chinese cities and provinces are facing growing strains. Guangdong, China's biggest province by gross domestic product, reported a drop in exports in the first eight months from a year earlier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

China's exports could be hit, and supply chain industries in China could be affected...We suspect the negative impact from the trade war has yet to be fully reflected in the economic data.' (ING Economic and Financial Analysis)Thought for the Day'Accusing the U.S. of 'launching the largest trade war in economic history to date,' Beijing has implemented retaliatory tariffs on 545 items worth $34B in response to the comparable U.S. duties that were enacted at midnight. Another $16B in tariffs are expected to go into effect in two weeks, and President Trump has warned of additional levies on $500B in Chinese goods.'So opens the lead news story in today's Wall Street Breakfast. The trade war is indeed intensifying. China is apparently getting angry. So is Europe, which is preparing its next retaliatory round, this time targeting ketchup. The Europeans like symbolism - be prepared to hear lectures on the different dressings into which Europeans can dip their pommes frites. As I've written and podcasted numerous times, I oppose trade protectionism on principle and see the current process as one that will slowly chip away (with or without ketchup) at economic growth.But trying to be objective about this, I don't think that China, the EU, Canada, Mexico or anyone else will prevail against the U.S. in the trade war. To the contrary, I think the U.S. simply has far more leverage, and far more staying power, than any of its trading partners.Look at the last sentence quoted above from the Wall Street Breakfast story: 'â€¦President Trump has warned of additional levies on $500B in Chinese goods.' The total volume of U.S. exports to China is just a fraction of that amount ($170 billion), so China could simply never retaliate on an equal basis. The trade balance between the U.S. and the EU is far more balanced. But the reality, which the Europeans know all too well, is that Europe is militarily dependent on the U.S. and America's European allies don't carry their weight when it comes to the financing of the NATO alliance. The U.S. can quite easily find ways of turning up the pressure if it wants to.For a demonstration of how this works, take a look at a Tweet from earlier this week on the president's Twitter page:'The OPEC Monopoly must remember that gas prices are up & they are doing little to help. If anything, they are driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members for very little $s. This must be a two way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW!'Saudi Arabia understands that the U.S. underwrites Gulf security. I think we will see oil prices coming down just as soon as they can ratchet up oil production.Whether or not the folks in Foggy Bottom prefer this method of diplomacy, it does give expression to the leverage the U.S. genuinely possesses vis-Ã -vis other nations. That suggests two possibilities: Either China, the EU, OPEC and others will find a face-saving way to yield to U.S. demands before they get hurt even more in this trade war; or they will accept more pain out of national pride.But as some of the numbers above indicate, there's room for much more pain. Economic policy is not carried out according to principles as laid out in textbooks. Behind the human conduct of business is usually a fair amount of monkey business, including and especially domestic sources of market distortion. Sometimes the rational thing to do is to lose a little in order to avoid losing a lot.Please share your thoughts in our comments section.

"Trade wars with the United States are likely to top discussions at the three-day summit meeting of the BRICS emerging economies -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that kicks off on WednesdayLeaders of the BRICS emerging economies -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- will meet in Johannesburg this week, with the threat of a worsening global trade war topping the agenda.US President Donald Trump's hardening stance has compounded fears of an all-out trade war after he slapped levies on goods from China worth tens of billions of dollars as well as tariffs on steel and aluminium from the EU, Canada and Mexico.Russian President Vladimir Putin, China's President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend the annual three-day summit starting in Johannesburg on Wednesday.Xi held talks with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in Pretoria on the eve of the gathering, saying that 'the Johannesburg summit has special significance for BRICS cooperation in the new circumstances.'China on Monday sharply rejected accusations by Trump that it was manipulating the yuan to give its exporters an edge, saying Washington appeared 'bent on provoking a trade war'.Trump has said he is ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of China imports, complaining that China's trade surplus with the US is due to unfair currency manipulation.Russian Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin said last week the Johannesburg meeting is 'about the context -- we are at a time when the US and China announce new measures almost every week'.He said much of the discussions with China would likely focus on what is happening with the United States.'This is a trade war, so leaders' discussions are particularly important in coordinating our positions,' said Oreshkin.- A unifying cause? -Sreeram Chaulia, of the Jindal School of International Affairs outside Delhi, said BRICS leaders would 'concur that the US has unleashed punitive trade wars that are hurting all the BRICS members'.'They have a collective interest in promoting intra-BRICS trade. The urgency this time is greater,' he said.The BRICS group, comprising more than 40 percent of the global population, represents some of the biggest emerging economies, but it has struggled to find a unified voice -- as well as achieving sharply different growth rates.Analysts say US trade policy could give the group some renewed momentum.'Trade agreements between associations of countries like BRICS have become increasingly important given the self-seeking, and ultimately short-sighted, barriers to trade that are being instigated by the US,' Kenneth Creamer, an economist at Johannesburg's Wits University, told AFP.'South Africa, and Africa more broadly, can benefit from increasing exports to fast growing countries like India and China. BRICS has the strategic potential to re-shape world trade.'The trade war risk also dominated a meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers at the weekend in Buenos Aires, while International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde again spoke out against the tit-for-tat tariffs.Xi arrived in South Africa after visiting Senegal and Rwanda as part of a whistlestop tour to cement relations with African allies.Signalling diplomatic rivalry over influence in Africa, India's Narendra Modi is visiting Rwanda and Uganda on his own five-day tour of the continent including the BRICS summit.Several African leaders will attend a 'BRICS outreach' programme on Friday, including Paul Kagame of Rwanda, Joao Lourenco of Angola, Macky Gall of Senegal and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda.Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan will also attend a summit as the current chair of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).

"Trade warâ€™s tariffs may spur relocation of some Chinese textile factories to other Asian nationsBeijingâ€™s retaliatory tariffs on US cotton will accelerate the offshoring of cotton spinning and lower-end textile and apparel manufacturing to South and Southeast Asia, and Chinese businesses are bracing for possible US tariffs on their finished goods if the trade war intensifies, industry executives have said.But for now, at least, fallout from Sino-US hostilities has been limited because Chinese manufacturers have ways to get around the added duties, said Stanley Szeto, chairman of the Hong Kong Textile Council.â€œSo far the cotton tariff has had a very small impact on the Chinese textile industry because there are various ways to avoid it,â€? Szeto said, referring to the 25 per cent additional tariff on US products, including cotton, that took effect on July 6.The Trump administrationâ€™s tentative 10 per cent tariff â€“ pending a public hearing next month â€“ on US$200 billion of Chinese merchandise has so far not touched the vast majority of China-made textiles and garments, except for fur and leather apparel and accessories like hats, gloves and handbags.â€œThe tit-for-tat trade war and possible coverage expansion of trade barriers will, however, see Chinese firms look more closely at relocating their manufacturing capacity across the supply chain to countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh,â€? he said.â€œBasically if the same product quality and delivery reliability can be attained in these nations at a 10 per cent cost advantage, they would have moved.â€?Szeto â€“ chairman of 62-year-old Hong Kong-based fashion producer Lever Style, which works with designer brands such as Paul Smith and J Crew â€“ said his firm made only about half its output in China, down from 100 per cent eight years ago.Before the recently added 25 per cent duty, most US cotton sent to China had been exempt from import tariffs, which range from 1 to 40 per cent, depending on volume and prices.Watch: Escalating trade war affects Trump merchandiseThis so-called â€œprocessing tradeâ€? â€“ in which cotton is imported by factories, some of which is located in â€œbonded supervision areasâ€?, and used to make products that are exported from China â€“ is exempt from tariffs.According to the China Cotton Association, normal imports that did not fall under the processing trade, bonded supervision areas and other special customs categories â€“ which are tariff-exempt provided no imported cotton is consumed in China â€“ accounted for only 21 per cent of total imports last year.This is despite the processing trades being subject to supervision and quotas set by local governments, which are reducing low-value-adding and pollution-prone manufacturing to drive the creation of more skilled jobs and improve the environment.There is uncertainty about whether Chinese authorities will allow more processing trade quotas even as Beijing announced a substantial increase in cotton imports last month, said Bosco Law Ching-kit of Lawsgroup, a Hong Kong-based textile manufacturer with more than 20,000 workers in China, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Myanmar.US trade war to plant seeds of change in Chinaâ€™s cotton industryâ€œIn view of the Sino-US trade war, whether [more] processing trade is acceptable by the Chinese government is in doubt,â€? said Law, the firmâ€™s chief executive.Meanwhile, industry executives expect the tariffs to accelerate the relocation of Chinese cotton-spinning operations to Southeast Asia.Law said that regardless of tariffs, supply-chain adjustments were an ongoing exercise for Chinese producers given rising costs.â€œWe are facing cost pressure all the time, not just because of tariffs but also labour and logistics costs,â€? he said. â€œKeeping operations efficient, sourcing materials with competitive pricing around the globe is the norm for all industrialists.â€?This article Trade warâ€™s tariffs may spur relocation of some Chinese textile factories to other Asian nations first appeared on South China Morning PostFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2018.More from South China Morning Post:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jonathan Kraut: Let the trade wars beginBy Signal ContributorTuesday, June 5th, 20181 SHARES Share TweetOne can make the argument that leadership starts with finding common needs, moving others towards meeting those needs, and creating trust through keeping oneâ€™s word and acting as promised.The President has launched yet another salvo of global economic destabilization by implementing the other day tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Even our closest economic partners, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union will be hit hard by taxing these imported materials.Blowing out the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord, and bitterly criticizing China for providing the inexpensive goods we buy apparently was not destabilizing enough.Thus, the Trade Wars have begun and every person on this planet is about to spend more for less as a result.Americans saved tons of money with a supply of goods less expensive from manufacturers overseas. Seems Trump doesnâ€™t care if the consumer pays more for everything in order to protect some steel mills and mining operations.What Trumpâ€™s action portend is higher prices here and around the world, uncertainty that the U.S. will keep its word and honor its agreements, and a few factory and mining executives making excessive bonuses.We should we never once again become a sweatshop, manufacturing, cheap labor economy. We should strive to continue to enhance our economic prowess which is by leading the world with innovation, new thinking, and technology.A hallmark of the Republican platform has been that free trade is good. This means moving in less expensive quality goods into our economy and selling our quality goods overseas without export taxes or tariffs. Free trade, the Republican Party has for a generation argued, stabilizes the world economy and everyone benefits as fair market values determines price.One excerpt from the 2016 Republican Platform reads like this:â€œInternational trade is crucial for all sectors of Americaâ€™s economy. Massive trade deficits are not. We envision a worldwide multilateral agreement among nations committed to the principles of open markets, what has been called a â€œReagan Economic Zone,â€? in which free trade will truly be fair trade for all concerned.â€?Using the trade deficit is an unsophisticated and simplistic way to view our economic success. Generally, countries who rely on cheap labor and underpay their employees generate a trade surplus.While it is true we import in value more than we export, the cheaper costs of goods not only improve the quality of our lives but allows Americans to spend their extra income here at home. I guess Trump did not read the last sentence which lauds free trade, meaning lessening or eliminating the kind of tariffs Trump has announced.Another except reads â€œWe need better negotiated trade agreements that put America first. When trade agreements have been carefully negotiated with friendly democracies, they have resulted in millions of new jobs here at home supported by our exports.â€?The first argument here that we need to put America first at the cost of the world economy ignores that when the world economy bends to our will our economy bends with it. The second remark about â€œnegotiated with friendly democraciesâ€? I assume refers to NAFTA, a treaty which we have broken and please point out to me these â€œmillions of new jobs.â€?While Trump comes down hard on most nations, he is still going soft on China, and of course very, very soft on Russia. I find this odd although the Republican Platform clearly attacks China. â€œWe cannot allow China to continue its currency manipulation, exclusion of U.S. products from government purchases, and subsidization of Chinese companies to thwart American imports.â€?Have you noticed any attempt to impede Chinese imports of late?The best part of the 2016 Republican Party Platform outlines Trumpâ€™s favorite tactic, which is to walk away from negotiations and then come back and pretend something good came out of this childish behavior.â€œRepublicans understand that you can succeed in a negotiation only if you are willing to walk away from it.â€?Kim Jong Un of North Korea, Putin of Russia, and Xi Jinping ruling Communist China all expect at the last-minute â€œTrump will walk away and with no substantive gain he will come back to the table and pretend new progress was a resultâ€? ploy.For the next few years I suggest we observe if prices go up or down, if trust in America is bolstered or is lost, and if our full employment economy continues on its current path.Looks like 2020 will be a Democratic Party year.Jonathan Kraut directs a private investigations firm, is the CFO of a private security firm, is the COO of an Acting Conservatory, is a published author, and Democratic Party activist.

"Radisson Hospitality Inc. is plunging ahead with a plan to triple capacity in China over five years, despite its expectation that a looming trade war with the U.S. will damp travel demand in the country.The chain controlled by Chinaâ€™s HNA Group Co., the aviation-to-hotels conglomerate, has 15 hotels in the country for a total 4,147 rooms, with 16 new properties under development, John Kidd, chief executive officer of Minnesota-based Radisson Hospitality, said in an interview Monday in Singapore.China is a â€œcritically important market for us, particularly as our owners are HNA and they are able to provide us support, guidance and connections to the market,â€? Kidd said. He was president and chief operating officer of HNA Hospitality Group before moving to Radisson.Trade tensions between the U.S. and China could put pressure on room occupancy and rates for eight to nine months, especially affecting corporate travel, Kidd said. â€œThere will be no need for travel if you canâ€™t sell goods in a particular market.â€?Beyond that period, the picture brightens, Kidd said, as domestic tourism demand will rise faster than hotel rooms are being added. Radisson has 15 hotels in China with 16 more under development. The focus is on expanding its Radisson and Park Inn affordable accommodations brands in second- and third-tier cities, such as Ningbo and Wuhan, he said. HNA gained control of Radisson through its acquisition of Carlson Hotels Inc.The growth trend in Chinaâ€™s travel market is moving away from luxury toward mid-scale, affordable brands, said Katerina Giannouka, Radisson president of Asia Pacific.Â©2018 Bloomberg L.P.

"President Donald Trump arrives to speak at the 119th Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention on Tuesday in Kansas City, Missouri. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesCongressional Republicans were blindsided on Tuesday by the Trump administrationâ€™s announcement that it would provide $12 billion in assistance to farmers hurt in the trade war being waged by Donald Trumpâ€”a move that looks an awful lot like â€œbailing outâ€? an economic sector suffering under poorly conceived government policy. The decision cuts so squarely against GOP orthodoxy that some Republicans could only watch and admire it.â€œI wish I was a farmer,â€? Utah Rep. Rob Bishop told me.He probably doesnâ€™t, though.Republicans in the Senateâ€”a bloc of resolute free-traders before their political fortunes were tied to the popularity of Donald Trumpâ€”expressed a range of reactions, from anger to convoluted tepid support, to I havenâ€™t heard about it yet. (Thereâ€™s a golden window for lawmakers of about three hours following a troubling announcement when they can get away with this excuse for not commenting.)The senators most willing to use pejoratives to describe the move were, predictably, the ones retiring in a few months. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker said that farmers were â€œbeing put on welfare,â€? and both he and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flakeâ€”who called the move â€œawfulâ€?â€”argued that what farmers want are free markets, not handouts.The most irate reaction, though, came from Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson.â€œThis is becoming more and more like a Soviet-type of economy here: Commissars deciding whoâ€™s going to be granted waivers, commissars in the administration figuring out how theyâ€™re going to sprinkle around benefits,â€? he said. (Johnson recently returned from a lovely trip to Russia, so maybe this was a compliment.)Some senators were also concerned about the precedent being set: If farmers get relief, shouldnâ€™t others too?â€œI want to know what weâ€™re going to say to the automobile manufacturers, and the petrochemical manufacturers, and to all the other people who are being hurt by tariffs,â€? Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy said. â€œNow youâ€™ve got to treat everybody the same. â€¦ And if we do help them, how much is that going to cost?â€?I asked him if he would call this a bailout.â€œYou can call it whatever you want to,â€? he said. â€œI call it $12 billion. And I call it a precedent.â€?Somehow, in the midst of this total rejection of the presidentâ€™s trade policy, Kennedy found a way to praise the presidentâ€™s trade acumen.â€œI donâ€™t think the president intends to start a trade war,â€? he said. â€œI think heâ€™s too smart for that. I think he understands that he only way to win a trade war is you donâ€™t fight the damn thing.â€? That would seem to conflict with the presidentâ€™s stated thinking on the matter: â€œTariffs are the greatest!â€? he tweeted Tuesday morning.Senators representing agricultural states suffering from retaliatory tariffs were generally warmer to the administrationâ€™s plan to hand money to their constituents a couple of months before the election. The defense they used was that if the administration feels it needs to temporarily pay off farmers in pursuit of a larger trade endgameâ€”whatever that is, and however achievable it may or may not beâ€”then the move is understandable.â€œIf thereâ€™s some way thatâ€? farmers can be helped â€œwhile weâ€™re correcting a bad situation with China,â€? Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe said, then it â€œsounds good to me.â€? He admitted that home-state interests, rather than any broad philosophical underpinning, were behind his support.â€œI have a bias towards the farmers more than some of the otherâ€? senators, Inhofe said.The long-term fear for those representing agricultural exporters, even if theyâ€™re OK with a cash infusion for the moment, is that the trade war will linger, trading partners will seek new arrangements with other countries, markets will be lost forever, and the handouts will become permanent. Whatever endgame Trump has in mind, he needs to reach it. Soon.â€œAll I can say is, it canâ€™t make up for the harm itâ€™s done so far, on the drop in soybean prices, let alone everything else,â€? Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley said. â€œWe need results from the negotiations.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Trumpâ€™s trade policies are beginning to have a negative impact both here at home and abroad.Take, for example, Harley Davidsonâ€™s recent decision to move part of their production overseas after the EU, in response to Trumpâ€™s tariffs, raised the tariffs on Harley motorcycles from 6% to a massive 32%.This great American company is being compromised by inbound tariffs on steel and aluminum components and declining demand for its products due to price increases.The U.S. HVAC manufacturing industry is similarly facing rising steel and aluminum prices, along with tariffs on many critical components. Adding to the problem, and surprising to many, a majority of U.S. steel manufacturers have already raised their prices by 25%. Buying American steel is not a solution. Small contractors and consumers are suffering greatly from these large increases in cost.President Trumpâ€™s chief trade adviser, Peter Navarro, and Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, are leading the charge for tariffs. Ross and Navarro may have good intentions, but they fail to understand that tariffs are taxes on the American people. Ultimately, tariffs undermine manufacturing and service jobs (as can be seen with Harley Davidson), raise prices and reduce economic growth (U.S. GDP is actively slowing due to concerns about the tariffs). In my view, both Ross and Navarro are seriously miscalculating the adverse impact of self-imposed tariffs on our economy. They fail to realize that their â€œnegotiating toolâ€? is presenting major hardships to employees and companies across America.At campaign rallies, many of Trumpâ€™s faithful applauded the presidentâ€™s rhetoric on tariffs but this enthusiasm will wane when jobs are lost. The current reaction by the stock market says it all. Markets donâ€™t react well to ill-defined policy, threats, and uncertainty.On a theoretical level, tariffs defy the basic economic and moral principle of cooperation. All human progress is based on cooperation; the fifty American states are the greatest example of the benefits of free trade, i.e. working together in harmony and being enormously productive.In his 1776 book, The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith stressed the importance of free trade, and was reinforced for centuries by economists such as David Ricardo, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Bastiat, and Milton Friedman. These economists stated that free trade provides the highest standard of living and America is the best example of the concept. Our citizens have enjoyed a high standard of living for decades because we have been free traders.Once tariffs are imposed, however, a trade war quickly ensues. These wars are losing battles and impossible to win. Trumpâ€™s trade war now involves several countries on four continents, with numerous businesses and industries hurting from the impact.To be fair, President Trumpâ€™s point on protecting U.S. intellectual property against China is extremely valid. It seems to me that this point specifically should be the thrust of his argument and his negotiations with China. There are several remedies to this problem, including ending the unfair sharing of technology and controlling federal spending (which China helps fund). These types of solutions would be far more effective and much less dangerous than a global economic trade war.Both the United States and our allies understand that right now and in the long term, China presents our biggest economic and foreign policy challenge. I believe this is where we should find a broad consensus with Europe, Britain, Mexico, and Canada. We need to unite with these longtime partners and work together to become less dependent on China. This will require free trade amongst ourselves and stronger capabilities in American technology and manufacturing.President Trump was on the right track when he suggested at the G7 meeting that the major industrial nations end all tariffs. Unfortunately, that recommendation fell on deaf ears. We will need to practice more use of persuasion, diplomacy, and carefully planned state visits to achieve these goals.I can say that Trumpâ€™s recent freemarket policies such as lower taxes and decreased intrusive regulation are creating economic opportunity. The results have been stupendous with very low unemployment, strong economic growth and investments in the future of America. This effort must continue. As weâ€™ve seen, tariffs are not the way to support and bolster Americans. The effects will only worsen as the ramifications of these policies continue to play out in the market.Now is the time for the United States to be a strong proponent of free markets and unilateral free trade with the EU, UK, Canada and Mexico. My guess is our trading partners will be more then willing to follow our lead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Trump has intensified his trade war rhetoric against China, saying that he is considering another set of heavy tariffs on Beijingâ€™s exports to the US. Sputnik spoke to Dr Qing Shan Ding, a senior lecturer in Marketing at Huddersfield University to find out more.Sputnik: So the presidentâ€™s threat to add another $100 billion worth of tariffs â€“ on top of the $50 billion he has already implemented â€“ have not only drawn the anger of China, but also amongst his own party. How likely is it that he will go through with this, or is he, in the words of one Republican senator, â€œblowing off streamâ€??Qing Shan Ding: Well with Trump, heâ€™s very unpredictable and of course the situation is ongoing. Heâ€™s hasnâ€™t had much time yet for these measures to be implemented so itâ€™s very unpredictable. But if the scale of the trader war is escalating I donâ€™t think his own party, especially his support base, a lot of farmer wonâ€™t be happy with these kinds of measures. Personally, I donâ€™t think this full blown trade war is going to happen. A lot of behind the door negotiations are happening anyway.Sputnik: Of course China took aim this week at the USâ€™ soybean industry, which many, especially within the Republican party, feared they would as these are grown in majority Republican states. Do you think itâ€™s likely that these will therefore start to erode the presidentâ€™s support base?Qing Shan Ding: I think it will definitely have some sort of impact because China is one of the biggest exporters of American agriculture. Soybeans for example were about fourteen billion dollars per year. This is the same as beef so thereâ€™s a lot of stake here that could hurt a lot of American farmers. So the support base wonâ€™t be happy. There are others things too: such as cars. America sells quite a lot of cars to China. Airplanes as well, obviously Boeing has a huge market in China as the countryâ€™s domestic aviation industry is booming and thereâ€™s a huge order for airplanes. Thereâ€™s a lot at stake. A lot of American jobs will be hit.So thereâ€™s a lot of stake here and many reports talk about if this kind of trade war is going to go ahead, itâ€™s going to hit America a lot more than China because a lot of these tariffs are based on American on American agricultural products. Soybeans for example, India sells a lot of soybeans, potentially China can source form there. China already imports a lot from Brazil. Argentina grows a lot of these as well.Sputnik: And finally, President Trump firstly said he was happy for a trade war, and then he said he didnâ€™t want one, but now heâ€™s threatening these additional tariffs, and in response while China has said that it doesnâ€™t want to fight a trade war, it will if necessary. So do you actually see this dreaded trade war happening in the future?Qing Shan Ding: A lot of this is targeting a strategy China is promoting called the â€˜made in China 2025.â€™ This is about China trying to upgrade its manufacturing capabilities. I think America in a sense is starting to see Chinaâ€™s economic ability as becoming some sort of strategic rival. So a lot of this kind of trade war talks is potentially more than just trade war talk; itâ€™s about the strategic rivalry starting to see the threat of a rising China. And theyâ€™re trying to think about whether they can use the trade leverage to curtail the rise of China.The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the speaker and do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"MOSCOW (Sputnik), Tommy Yang - Facing harsh tariffs of 25 percent when exporting to the United States, Chinese exporters are not ready to give up on the US market completely and remain hopeful that they can work with their US clients and adapt to the difficult reality.The highly anticipated trade war between China and the United States went into full swing on Friday, when US Customs started to charge 25 percent import duties on 818 types of Chinese products valued at $34 billion, following the decision announced by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) in June. The USTR also plans to impose the same 25 percent import duties on additional 284 types of Chinese products with an approximate value of $16 billion in the near future, after completing further reviews.High-Quality US ClientsÂ© AFP 2018 / STR China Slaps US With 25% Tarriffs on $34Bln Worth of Goods as Trade War EscalatesTaizhou Eternal Hydraulic Machine Co. in Eastern Chinaâ€™s Zhejiang province happens to be one of the Chinese exporters subject to the new stiff tariffs in the US market, as its key product is electric motors, which falls under the 818 types of targeted products.With about 20 percent of the companyâ€™s annual revenue of around $8 million coming from sales to clients from the United States, itâ€™s impossible for the company to simply quit the US market, the firmâ€™s general manager Leo Wu told Sputnik.'Itâ€™s unrealistic for us to give up on the US market. Itâ€™ll be a very difficult situation for us. The United States has been a very stable market for my company and we have established a lot of long-term customers over the years. We still prefer to work with them, if we still have a chance to, because it takes time to develop new customers,' he said.READ MORE: China to Back Europe in Trade War with USA â€” AnalystsOther Chinese exporters explained why they prefer to do business with US clients, compared to clients from the emerging markets.'To be honest, itâ€™s much easier for us to communicate with customers from the United States because theyâ€™re not as focused on getting cheaper prices as other clients from the developing countries. They usually donâ€™t try to bargain repeatedly for a lower price, after quoting a price from us. I can say US clients are much more candid,' Nancy Fan, a sales manager at Wuxi Nengli Bearing Company Limited in Eastern Chinaâ€™s Jiangsu Province, told Sputnik.Fanâ€™s company specializes in exporting various kinds of bearings, which are also covered in the 818 types of targeted Chinese products. About 20 percent of her companyâ€™s annual sales come from the US market.Price Cut ImpossibleDespite planning to continue to do business with US-based customers, Fan from Wuxi Nengli Bearing Company Limited said it was impossible for her company to cut prices to share the burden from the tariffs hike with its US clients because the profit margin is too low.'Regarding the 25 percent tariffs, we can only continue to offer the prices we can afford to our US clients. Thereâ€™s not much we can do to help them. They need to find solutions on their own. In todayâ€™s international trade, the profit margin has become very transparent. Itâ€™s not like the high-profit margin from many years ago. Itâ€™s impossible for us to cut our prices, as we are already offering very low prices on our orders. Our average profit margin is only about 5-10 percent today,' she said.READ MORE: China to Breathe New Life in Venezuelan Oil Company Despite US' IreAccording to Fan, her US clients have not demanded lower prices, but also have not made inquiries on new orders.'Theyâ€™re probably still holding out and see how long the new tariffs will stay in place, to decide if they need to buy from other Asian countries,' she said.Jiang Guocheng, general manager of Ningbo Steedtools Corporation, which relies on the US market for over 50 percent of its annual sales, expressed his frustration over the harsh tariffs from the United States.'Talking about responses [to the new tariffs], thereâ€™s not really much we can do. The situation cannot change according to our will. We definitely will continue to communicate with our US clients. But our bottom line is that itâ€™s impossible for us to offer a price that doesnâ€™t generate any profit. If we sell at a price that loses money for us in the end, how can our company survive?' Jiang told Sputnik.Key products from Jiangâ€™s company, such as power drills and hammers, will also face the 25 percent import duties in the US market.No ExceptionWu from Taizhou Eternal Hydraulic Machine Co. remains hopeful about his companyâ€™s chances in the US market, in face of the new tariffs.'The tariffs are implemented across the board, without targeting a specific company. Maybe there will be difficulties in the next few months. But after that, the business has to continue. Every Chinese exporter who wants to do business in the US market faces the exact same problem. Even if we need to make some adjustment to our prices, we can continue to do business with our US clients as long as itâ€™s profitable for us,' he said.As US President Donald Trump started to make threats to slap harsh tariffs on Chinese products in March, Wuâ€™s clients from the United States even placed more orders in the first half of this year, to boost their inventory in anticipation of the tariff hike.The Zhejiang-based Chinese exporter even saw a silver lining from the new tariffs in the US market.'In my business, many of my US clients are second-hand resellers, who slap their logo on our products and then export to other markets, such as South America. After the tariffs hike, the margins will be greatly reduced when selling to customers from South America, who may decide to buy from me directly,' he said.READ MORE: The Consequences of the Kim-Trump Deal for Other Asian CountriesIn response to new US tariffs, China imposed retaliatory duties on US products with a matching $34 billion value on Friday, the Chinese customs said in a statement.

"As a trade conflict between the US and China continues to escalate, Beijing has reduced tariffs on thousands of products from five APTA countries â€“ India, South Korea, Bangladesh, Laos and Sri Lanka. Sputnik discussed this, and the possible benefits and losses of the US-China trade war, with Loren Puette, director of market research at ChinaAg.Sputnik: Recently China has moved to cut tariffs for some Asian countries, what do you make of this move? And what do you think is behind it?Loren Puette: First off, it's been a move long and coming, so it's a bit of a coincidence that it occurs right at the moment when China and the US are on the brink of a trade war, but this APTA â€“ Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement â€“ as I mentioned, it's just a long time coming. A lot of the cuts on tariffs focus on machinery, steel, coal, industrial products, which the US has sought to increase tariffs on coming into their country, so in a way it's to mitigate this effect. But the countries involved â€“ India, Bangladesh, Laos, South Korea â€“ it's questionable how much of an effect this will have, because the US is a major market and China cannot just pick up the slack with these countries immediately; so it's an incremental change and sure enough there will be more on the horizon.READ MORE: India Changing Attitude Toward China, Stops to Look Back at US â€” AnalystSputnik: Do you see China looking westward for additional trade partnerships?Loren Puette: My background specifically is in agricultural markets, in terms of looking westward, they could look to Kazakhstan, to Ukraine. In general the largest exports from the US to China, after aircraft and machinery parts, is soybeans and agricultural products. Countries that can potentially fill this gap primarily are Ukraine and they're looking to be involved in the Silk Road initiative, they're holding talks, it's ongoing. They produce a fair amount of corn, not so much soybeans, which is what China imports from the US, but there has been a lot of movement in the Black Sea region. Cofco, which is essentially the national agribusiness company of China, they've been making heavy investments into the Black Sea region, they own a few terminals, they've set up a major terminal in 2016, so they're definitely looking westwards, but this is still not enough to bridge the gap that is being created right now with this potential trade war.The views expressed in this article are those of the speaker, and do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

China will allow Japanese investors to buy assets using offshore yuan for a sum of up to $31,4 billion dollars and a bank for clearing payments will be opened in Tokyo.More important is that the two countries will resume talks on implementing a foreign currency swap agreement.

"WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - Most of the sectors in the US economy will suffer from the growing trade clashes between the United States and China at a time when both countries need to resolve serious bilateral security issues, former consultant to the European Union Paolo von Schirach told Sputnik.On Friday, President Donald Trump imposed 25 percent import tariffs on $50 billion worth of technology goods from China, prompting Beijing to swiftly levy symmetrical tariffs on more than 600 US products.'Some sectors of the US economy may enjoy some relief because tariffs will fend off Chinese competitors,' Schirach said.

Beijing often restricts US companies from market access while questionable non-tariff barriers and other onerous obligations are imposed on US investors, he added.The Chinese government had also forced US companies to share proprietary technologies in order to gain market access, Schirach said.

"Written by AP Economics Writer, PAUL WISEMAN published on May 1, 2018 - 2:09 PMShare this:(AP) â€” The White Houseâ€™s on-again, off-again tariffs are heightening uncertainty for U.S. companies that buy steel and aluminum and the foreign companies that supply them.And major American allies, from Europe to Canada and Mexico, are signaling increasing resentment.Delivering its second reprieve for steel and aluminum imports, the Trump administration late Monday postponed the tariffs that had been set to take effect Tuesday. But it decided to limit the delay to 30 days. After that, no one knows what the administration will do.â€œItâ€™s nice to have a little breather,â€? said John McDonald, an executive at Trans-Matic Manufacturing, a supplier of precision metal components in Nashville, Tennessee, which buys $16.5 million in steel annually, some of it from Finland, the Netherlands, Russia and Taiwan.But â€œthe uncertainty is going to continue,â€? McDonald said. â€œWeâ€™re struggling with supply availability, lead times.â€?With the potential conflict only delayed, the European Union, which has vowed to slap tariffs on American bourbon, motorcycles, blue jeans and other goods if the U.S. taxes its steel and aluminum, warned that it wonâ€™t â€œnegotiate under threat.â€?The delay comes just as the United States prepares for high-stakes trade talks with China this week over Beijingâ€™s efforts to challenge U.S. technological dominance.The rift with the EU and other allies stems from the Trump administrationâ€™s decision in March to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imports. In doing so, it made the unusual claim that a dependence on imported metals posed a national security threat to the United States.But it soon backed off, for a time. It granted the EU, Mexico and Canada exemptions from the tariffs that were to expire Tuesday before they were extended for a month at the last minute.Separately, the United States has reached a deal with South Korea, which agreed to limit steel shipments to the U.S. in exchange for being spared the tariffs.Some analysts suspect that the Trump trade team hopes to pressure the EU and others to accept quotas on their steel exports to the United States as the price for having the tariffs lifted.Speaking Tuesday at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer avoided saying whether the administration would be willing to extend again the one-month delay in the tariffs.Lighthizer also said â€œwe more or less have an agreementâ€? to permanently exempt Argentina, Australia and Brazil from the metals tariffs.The U.S. is seeking to use the tariff threat to pressure Canada and Mexico to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement more to President Donald Trumpâ€™s liking. Among other things, Trump wants to see more auto production moved to the United States.But Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says â€œCanada and Mexico look at the NAFTA negotiations as a long-term deal. Theyâ€™re not going to take shortcuts and agree to a bad deal that has long-term implicationsâ€? just to escape the immediate threat of steel and aluminum tariffs.â€œThe administration has created a moment of crisis but made it very difficult politically for all sides to get out of this and still claim victory,â€? Bown says.In the meantime, manufacturers that buy steel and aluminum are struggling with uncertainty. The Swedish appliance maker Electrolux in March postponed plans to modernize a plant in Springfield, Tennessee. That decision had consequences for the tool-and-dye maker Vaughn Manufacturing in Nashville, which has been supplying Electrolux for years. Vaughn has had to delay plans to expand its staff of 60 until the tariff situation is resolved.Tuesdayâ€™s extension of the tariff reprieve â€œjust lengthens the uncertainty,â€? says Mark Vaughn, the company president.The U.S. tariffs would likely raise steel prices in the United States, thereby increasing costs for American manufacturers that buy steel and putting them at a competitive disadvantage with foreign rivals that can buy cheaper steel.â€œIf those tariffs were to hit, our prices would go up and we would no longer be competitive,â€? says Trans-Matic President Patrick J. Thompson.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the constant twitter blitzkrieg from Trump, through the oceans of toxic politics and the ever growing war against the truth, we would be forgiven if we were somehow lulled into a state of shocked passive apathy that at least Donald as a vengeful chaos actor isnâ€™t here to stay, that his permanence on reality is an unfortunate experiment that has accidentally happened and there is no reason to his madness.Donald Trump, an American revenge fantasy fuelled on dislocated cultural resentment barking at every car that passes has the silver lining that heâ€™s too controlled by his feral insecurities and internal doubts to pose an ongoing assault against progress.I think that view of Trump may be accurate, but the handlers around him have learnt fawning flattery are the steering wheel to this President and theyâ€™re over arching strategies are the ones being implemented by a President who sees them as just new tools to hammer out his endless seething resentment against the rest of humanity.Space Force?I get we are all mocking Trumpâ€™s â€˜Space Forceâ€™ but it actually represents a dangerous militarisation of Space.American Hawks see China and Russiaâ€™s new generation of first strike nuclear weapons as a direct challenge to American hegemony and militarising space is a response to that challenge.Opening up a new frontier of hostility in an area once agreed to be for mutual scientific benefit to humanity isnâ€™t just a crime against shared human achievement, itâ€™s the start of a new weapons race with unstable triggers.Putin AweMany have hoped the fawning display by Trump towards Putin was proof positive the Russian Leader has dirt on Trump. Iâ€™m not ruling that out, but there is another frame Trumpâ€™s jaw dropping response to Putin needs to be viewed through.The Alt-Rightâ€™s love affair with Putin started when Putin made life difficult for Obama. The Alt-Rightâ€™s gnawing hatred of Obama was such that anyone who challenged him, even a cold blooded KGB thug, became a hero in their eyes. It was this vortex of spite and vitriol that helped spawn Trumpâ€™s brand of political resentment and Trump came to the White house viewing Putin as much a hero as the Alt-Right did.Trumpâ€™s display at Helsinki could be that of a guilty conscience, but it could also be the behaviour of a slathering star struck fan who was meeting his idol.I fear simply hoping Trump trips up on the Kremlin to end this nightmare early via impeachment for collusion is wishful thinking.Trade wars with China, Iran, Turkey & VenezuelaThe Hawks around Trump are convinced China is far more economically weak than they pretend to be, and that the best way to avoid direct military confrontation with Beijing is to pull their economy down through a trade war.This unilateral economic stance has repercussions and we are seeing those in Turkey, the unbelievably stupid decision on Iran and the self inflicted misery of Venezuela.Each three of those countries face enormous economic meltdown as collateral damage to Trumpâ€™s trade war with China. The possibility for miscalculation here is as dangerous as military confrontation because any one of those countries in economic free fall could trigger far larger regional depressions which all have the possibility of triggering global impacts.This plan to destabilise China economically is also dangerous because a wounded China is unlikely to simply regress from the global stage, they are likely to do what any emerging power that is being slowly strangled does â€“ go to war.We forget how much of an impact economic sanctions by America on Japan had to do with Japanâ€™s decision to strike at Pearl Harbour.Trump isnâ€™t just a mad dog barking at everything that passes him, his plans, as empty headed as they appear, have deceptively huge ramifications on the rest of us.Trump really is as dangerous as he is grotesquely offensive. Donald doesnâ€™t just burn books, he incinerates shared future?.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chinaâ€™s Economy Soars Despite Trade War Fears By Jan Bauer â€“ Safe HavenChinaâ€™s economy grew 6.8 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared to the same quarter of 2017, but while the country is targeting an enviable full-year growth rate, looming tariff threats may trip it up by then.On Tuesday, the Chinese government released official economic data, showing that growth hasnâ€™t skipped a beat as a result of the trade war back-and-forth with the United States. So far, the countryâ€™s economic growth rate is in line with the second half of 2017.But full-year growth will lag slightly behind last year. Annual growth for 2017 was 6.9 percent, and Beijing is targeting full-year growth for 2018 at 6.5 percent.The more granular details, however, were not as impressive. Most notably, March industrial output missed expectations and first-quarter fixed-asset investment growth was slower, Reuters reported.March retail sales also rose slightly more than analysts expected.Asian stocks had mixed responses to the data, opening higher but then largely going flat. Hong Kong and Shanghai retreated Tuesday despite better-than-expected growth figures coming out of Beijing.â€œThere are two stories here, one backward looking and one forward looking,â€? Robert Subbaraman, chief economist for Asia excluding Japan at Nomura in Singapore, told Moneycontrol.â€œUnderneath the stable GDP growth is quite rapid rebalancing from industrial, investment and old economy sectors to consumption, services and new economy sectors like tech. This is encouraging. â€¦ The more timely March data, however, point to nascent signs of a growth slowdown underway, led by these old economy sectors,â€? Subbaraman said.â€œIn practice, growth is almost certainly slower than officials claim and looks to have edged down slightly last quarter. But the big picture is that economic momentum did hold up fairly well in Q1, with the easing of pollution controls sparking a recovery in industrial activity,â€? Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in comments carried by The Associated Press.Likewise, speaking to CNN Money, Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard, said â€œWe think a further slowdown is on the cards before the end of the yearâ€?.Macquarieâ€™s Larry Hu echoed similar sentiments, calling the Q1 peak of growth in Chinaâ€™s massive export sector and expecting a slowdown in the coming months.In the meantime, Beijing is shrugging off threats to its growth posed by Trumpâ€™s tariff binge, with a government spokesman saying $150 billion in tariff hike threats coming from the U.S. will not derail the $12-trillion-a-year economy.â€œChina is fully capable of responding to Sino-U.S. trade frictions, responding to challenges and maintaining sustained and health economic development,â€? National Bureau of Statistics spokesman Xing Zhihong told a news conference.Sharing is caring!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chinaâ€™s state media has repeatedly called for national confidence amid rumors that Xi would face criticism at the meeting.As August approached, non-Chinese mainland media once again began to carefully follow the whereabouts of senior Chinese leaders, hoping to discern whether the annual secret meeting at the seaside resort town of Beidaihe in Hebei Province had begun.The Beidaihe meeting has been traditionally regarded by China watchers at home and abroad as a significant conference that can change the track of Chinaâ€™s politics. Chinaâ€™s state media tends to refrain from reporting on it, meanwhile, international media watches carefully for signs of the gathering.Mao Zedong, who disliked bureaucratic red tape, initiated the idea of having senior officials gather for summer vacation and meeting in an unofficial format at Beidaihe early in 1953. Due to its unofficial characteristic, this meeting can also provide retired top leaders a chance to speak their mind on national policies with current leaders.Anonymous sources told Reuters that the latest Beidaihe meeting â€œwas likely in early August.â€?On August 8, Xinhua reported that Chinese Premier Li Keqiang had met with Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, the president-elect of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, in the afternoon at Beidaihe. This information â€œoffered further evidence,â€? as Reuters put it, that the secretive Beidaihe meeting is indeed happening now.Amid the trade war with the United States, a series of social and financial risks are also looming large domestically in China. Criticism directly targeting the foreign and domestic policies of current top leader has emerged despite fierce censorship. Rumors that Chinaâ€™s top leader would be condemned during the Beidaihe meeting spread like wildfire.Perhaps in an attempt to snuff out those rumors, Chinese state media urged Chinese citizens to confront national difficulties with confidence.Also on August 8, Peopleâ€™s Daily published a 4000-plus word article under the title â€œTo create a beautiful life regardless of rain or windâ€? on its front page.Recalling 70 years of development since the foundation of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, the article said that Chinese nationals were able to conquer various difficulties and create a beautiful life â€œunder the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.â€?Yet, the article pointed out, â€œcertain people, for the sake of their own personal interest, are now raising high the tariff barriers and waving around the stick of hegemonic power.â€? These people will only end up â€œlifting a stone to drop on their own feet,â€? the article said, without singling the United States out.Admitting that â€œTodayâ€™s China is experiencing the wind and rain of development,â€? the article finally urged 1.3 billion Chinese nationals to â€œtake your own path and do your own businessâ€? with confidence, faith and collective power.Itâ€™s particularly worth noting that the article was attributed to â€œXuan Yan (??),â€? which in Chinese means â€œdeclaration.â€? It is widely known in China as a pen name coined specially for Chinaâ€™s top propaganda authority, as â€œXuan Yanâ€? can also represent the abbreviation for â€œthe speech of the propaganda organ.â€?Hours after â€œXuan Yanâ€? announced its â€œdeclarationâ€? on Peopleâ€™s Daily, Xinhua published a similar style commentary, under the title of â€œTreading down the obstacles to make a big road.â€? With lyrical rhetoric, this commentary also called for national confidence to confront all challenges from abroad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Talks wonâ€™t do much good unless both sides come to understand how their opponent thinks about the issues.Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen is in Washington this week for another round of talks with American officials, in search of a breakthrough that could bring a truce in the current trade war. The two sides havenâ€™t met since June, and the current meeting only involves middle-ranked officials. Both sides are playing down any idea that this fresh dialogue will produce a solution to what is quickly becoming a stalemate. U.S. President Donald Trump has said he has no deadline, and that, in fact, he may extend tariffs to cover all Chinese imports. This will have shaken the Chinese side, who are accustomed to American negotiators who clamor for quick decisions, and then often buckle when bluffed.If the goal of this weekâ€™s meeting is for Americans and Chinese to better â€œunderstand one another,â€? then there are several aspects of one anotherâ€™s history, economy, motives, and psychology that would be well-considered for both sides to embrace and internalize.The Chinese SideIt is futile to try to understand the Chinese perspective on the trade war without taking into account how the Chinese have felt all along about letting in the outside world.The roots of todayâ€™s trade war start at least in the Opium Wars of the 19th century. In truth, they extend much earlier. China never had much of an appetite for foreigners, their wares, or their ideas. China was relatively self-satisfied for much of its long history, and its experience with foreign involvement was rarely uplifting.The bitterness, resentment, shame, and humiliation that Chinese feel from its historical experience with foreigners in China plumbs deep waters. It should be required viewing for any American going to China to watch the movie The Sand Pebbles. Apart from being a really good story and an excellent movie, it imparts the history lesson of American Navy gunboats patrolling Chinese rivers in support of American businesses and businessmen in the early part of the 20th century. The vast majority of Americans know nothing about this, but the Chinese do, almost every single one of them. And it is part of what they see when they look at an American.The Chinese side of the argument, therefore, might run something like this:Despite our misgivings, and despite our history with foreigners, we encouraged you to come to China and build your factories here. We let you use our people and pay them pittance. We controlled and managed labor issues for you. You never had the headache of labor unions, because we donâ€™t allow them. We built infrastructure, wrote laws that were foreign to our ideas, and made sure you had nice places for your management and staff to live, much nicer than most Chinese have even today. We built export processing zones, where you could import your raw materials and components tax-free, make the product, and export it easily. Weâ€™ve let you access our markets, as well, although we were so poor at the beginning of our economic reforms that we could barely afford Chinese products, much less foreign ones. By doing all this, your costs went to rock bottom. Chinese profit margins are low. Yours are high. We gave you a path to a level of profit that you never had by manufacturing in America. And now you complain that weâ€™re exporting too much! Donâ€™t Americans like lower prices?One would think by now that the Chinese would understand that most Americans are not rich. Thousands of communities across America would be profoundly and positively affected, economically and socially, by any company who would bring a factory to their town.This is a reality about America which many Chinese either donâ€™t know or choose to ignore. For those who do know it, and have seen it, itâ€™s disturbing. The truth about American life alters an image of the United States that the Chinese partly depend upon for their own identity â€” for the modern Chinese identity is very much wrapped up in matching the United States, and exceeding it if possible. The ambitious Chinese, egged on by a government and a Communist Party that holds the U.S. up as the target to beat, find it very uncomfortable that the target has so many holes in it.â€œWhy are factory jobs important to you? Youâ€™re rich!â€? one Chinese associate said recently.Because many Chinese underestimate the importance of those factory jobs to Americans â€“ and similarly underestimate the extent of Americansâ€™ patriotism and nationalism, so different from the Chinese varieties â€” China may be surprised at the extent to which Americans will consent to bear the costs of the trade war.The American SideChina did not open its door to the outside world so that the world could get rich; China opened its door so that China could get rich.This would seem to state the obvious. That this point alone is rarely considered by most Americans in negotiations with China is a fundamental flaw in the U.S. approach. China is and always has been acting in its own self-interest, which should be considered normal.The position of the U.S. side might be summarized as:We invested in China when it was risky. We found ways to get around your very significant human rights issues. We brought technology, and only asked that you respect our right to it. We brought companies, from Motorola to Proctor and Gamble, that have changed the face of Chinese life. We have welcomed hundreds of thousands of Chinese students to America. And what do you do? You steal our technology, copy it, and sell it back to us, and on to other markets in the world, at a lower price! How ungrateful!That the U.S. government, as well as many others, have now called the Chinese â€œthievesâ€? is very strong stuff. To a bilingual ear, it sounds even worse in Chinese than it does in English.The United States would be well-served to remember that the mission of American companies in China was never altruistic. The mission was always profit, which, again, should be considered normal. And under that mission, American and other foreign companies have indeed transferred â€” by one method or another â€” a great deal of valuable technology to China.However, it is wrong to characterize those transfers as â€œforced.â€? U.S. companies have often jumped at the chance to set up R&D centers in China. Far from being forced, companies have welcomed the opportunity. They see lower R&D costs, access to an educated workforce in their industries, and the potential of greater market access in China. American negotiators should not press this issue too greatly, as most of the overt technology transfers have been made by willing collaborators, not by hostages.The U.S. position is strong in this trade war. It can be made stronger by understanding the Chinese sideâ€™s historical perspective, and not over-inflating the harm that has been done to American companies, when much of that harm was self-inflicted.If this weekâ€™s talks are a listening session, then the Chinese should try to work toward an understanding of the United States as it really is. Ultimately, however, the Chinese will need to work toward a greater internalization of the meaning of rule of law. The Americans would do well to understand the historical context and motives of the Chinese side. And ultimately, Americans need to understand the role that U.S. multinationals have played in creating this situation, and hold them accountable. Much of where we are today lies at their door, not Chinaâ€™s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LONDON/PARIS (Reuters): An escalating trade war between the United States and China could abruptly end a glittering stock market run for luxury goods firms, with some investors already put off by lofty valuations in a sector powered by shoppers in the two countries.From pricey handbags to designer shoes, booming sales at the European companies that dominate the industry like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (LVMH.PA) and Gucci parent Kering (PRTP.PA) have made them investor favorites, with shares still near record highs.But the possible trickle down effect of tit-for-tat tariffs hikes on consumers is adding to jitters over heady valuations, even though luxury firms are not as directly threatened by rising protectionism as carmakers and industrial companies. The sector has an average valuation of 21 times 12-month earnings forecasts, according to Reuters data, down from its May peak, but still 23 percent above its 10-year average.â€œWe are not making a call that they are bad companies, we think theyâ€™re great companies. But theyâ€™re bad investments,â€? said Edinburgh-based David Keir, co-manager of the Saracen Global Income and Growth fund, which dropped its LVMH holdings last year and sold out of German suit maker Hugo Boss in early July. â€œNow thereâ€™s an incremental risk from the great unknown of trade tariffs as well.â€?It would not be the first demand-driven wobble the luxury industry has faced. In 2012, a Chinese crackdown on corruption caused purchases of premium cognac and other high-end goods used as gifts to fall sharply, taking the likes of LVMH and Remy Cointreau shares down with them. This time, tariffs threaten consumersâ€™ spending power in both the United States and China â€“ the worldâ€™s two biggest consumers of European luxury goods, which make up just over half the industryâ€™s revenues.The impact on confidence in Chinaâ€™s markets, including the depreciation of the renminbi that would eat into Chinese touristsâ€™ budgets for shopping in Europe, is among risks that may not be fully reflected in stocks yet, analysts warn.â€œWe see very little priced in so far,â€? said UBS analysts, who forecast as much as a 30 percent share price drop in the sector index in the event of a fully-fledged trade war.Among the stocks that would be worse affected, UBS included Italyâ€™s Salvatore Ferragamo and Britainâ€™s Burberry (BRBY.L). The two brands are in the midst of turnaround plans that have yet to fully hit their stride.CHINA THRIVINGSo far, the knock-on effect on revenues has been muted.If anything, Chinese demand for Louis Vuittonâ€™s leather goods ticked up in the second quarter compared to the first, LVMH reported, while most firms argue their core clientele is here to stay.â€œWe have still an expansion of the middle and upper class in China,â€? Keringâ€™s group managing director Jean-Francois Palus told analysts following the companyâ€™s half-year results.Sales in China have been largely driven by a young clientele unafraid of splurging on branded goods, and often financed by their parents and grandparents, with rising property prices also providing a source of wealth.Even a moderate slowdown in the pace of revenue growth, as is expected regardless of the trade spat after two years of rebounding demand in China, is not enough to spook some drawn to the sectorâ€™s underlying strengths.â€œDemand is really healthy,â€? said Andrea Gerst, co-portfolio manager of GAMâ€™s Luxury brands fund, which has stakes in many major European labels. â€œIf comparatives get more difficult, then the absolute madness may not be as strong, but thereâ€™ll still be healthy growth.â€?More broadly, global luxury sales are driven by some of the worldâ€™s wealthiest shoppers who might shrug off any direct impact from tariffs were it to come to that.â€œWith luxury youâ€™ve got people who are far less price-sensitive as your customers and so you ask yourself if thereâ€™s a tax put on and the price goes up a bit, how much is that really going to change the demand?â€? said Fergus Shaw, partner and portfolio manager at Cerno Capital.Shaw said his fund owns LVMH shares, and he has not been tempted to sell out, expecting any impact from tariffs to be much smaller than the anti-corruption drive was.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON: (Agencies) Ahead of President Trumpâ€™s trip to New York Sunday for key meetings with other world leaders at the UN General Assembly, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in no uncertain terms that the US is â€œgoing to winâ€? its ongoing trade dispute with China.Pompeo, who previously served as Trumpâ€™s CIA director, also warned that â€œwe have real risk to outside agents trying to do harm to Americaâ€? ahead of the midterm elections, and took a hard line on Iran and North Korea during the wide-ranging interview with a TV channel.â€œThe trade war by China against the United States has been going on for years,â€? Pompeo said. â€œHereâ€™s whatâ€™s different in this administration. To the extent one wants to call this a trade war, we are determined to win it.â€?China pulled out of scheduled trade talks with the US this week as tensions between the two countries have escalated. On Monday, the White House announced new tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports and, in retaliation, China imposed its own taxes on $60 billion in US goods.

"By P PREM KUMAR, ALIFAH ZAINUDDIN & DASHVEENJIT KAUR / Pic By ISMAIL CHE RUSThe escalating trade war between the US and China could drive the Asean to conclude the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) negotiations by year-end.International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Darell Leiking (picture) said the government hopes for a substantial update at the upcoming Asean Summit in November.â€œLeaders have reaffirmed their intention to resolve regional trade deals in numerous meetings because it is an important effort. I am hoping something will come out by the end of the year,â€? he told reporters on the sidelines of the Malaysia: A New Dawn Investorsâ€™ Conference held in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.Darell has stressed the importance of the regional grouping to form a bloc at a time of rising global trade uncertainties.â€œThe prospect of an intense trade war between China and the US is the top concern of most South-East Asian countries.â€œThe blocâ€™s ability to persuade its partners to move in the same direction will be crucial to reaching an agreement,â€? he said when asked on how long before a consensus can be reached among Asean nations.If succeeds, RCEP will become the worldâ€™s largest trading bloc, accounting for 3.4 billion people with a total GDP of US$49.5 trillion (RM202.95 trillion).The proposed mega freetrade agreement in East Asia is built upon the existing agreements of Asean with its six dialogue partners â€” Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand.RCEPâ€™s key objectives are to achieve a modern, comprehensive, high-quality and mutually beneficial economic partnership between the participating countries.The trade war between the US and China is already been felt globally.â€œThe collateral damage from the trade war is felt by everyone and not just Malaysia,â€? Darell said, in reference to Malaysiaâ€™s shrinking trade surplus.The International Monetary Fund yesterday said the trade uncertainty would impact the Asean-5, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.It maintained a 5.3% growth forecast for the South-East Asian countries for this 2018, but lowered the 2019 estimate to 5.2%.This came after analysts lowered Malaysiaâ€™s growth forecast following Malaysiaâ€™s record of its the lowest trade surplus in 45 months.A slowdown in Malaysiaâ€™s exports relative to its imports in August led to a smaller trade surplus of RM1.6 billion, the lowest since October 2014.â€œSometimes, numbers donâ€™t say it all. Our country can be doing good locally, but because of conditions out there we are impacted, especially trade wise.â€œHence, amid a growing tide of protectionism, Asean leaders are intent on pressing ahead with the trade liberalisation the bloc has been spearheading,â€? Darell said, stressing on the urgency to form the trade bloc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chinaâ€™s Xi Determined to Fight and Defeat US in Trade WarUS President Trump first threatened to start a trade war with China to reduce US trade deficit with China, but when China offered to buy more US goods starting from the additional purchase of $70 billion of US goods this year, Trump does not accept.He, instead, wanted China to cease alleged theft or forced transfer of US technology and refrain from providing funds for development of Chinaâ€™s own high technology. Particularly, to scrap Chinaâ€™s Made in China 2025 plan.As China has not stolen or force transfer of US technology, promising ceasing doing so will hurt Chinaâ€™s dignity. (See my post â€œTheft, Forced Transfer of US Technology but the Pretext for Trade Warâ€? on July 21.)China wants to switch from export- and investment-geared economic growth to creation-, innovation- and consumption-geared economic growth. Promising not to provide funds for creation and innovation means that China has to give up its pursuit of the China dream of national rejuvenation. China dream is also Chinese President Xi Jinpingâ€™s dream. Can he give up that dream?The truth is that the US wants to start a trade war to destroy China or at least stop Chinaâ€™s rise. The trade deficit was but a pretext for starting the war. Trump did not expect that China is so generous and sincere in reducing the trade deficit to make him unable to use the deficit as a pretext to start the trade war.He has to find another pretext. Having no pretext available, he resorts to falsification so that he has invented the accusation of China stealing and forcing transfer of US technology, Based on such false accusation, he set the term that China must stop theft and forced transfer of US technology and scrap Chinaâ€™s Made in China 2025 plan. He knows well China can never accept such term as to humiliate itself so that he is sure that he can use the pretext to start the trade war. True enough he does have started the trade war he wants.However, how can Trump convince American people to obtain popular support? SCMPâ€™s report â€œXi Jinping â€˜doesnâ€™t intend to follow throughâ€™ on trade war talks and local Chinese officials are â€˜like mafioso donsâ€™, says top Donald Trump adviser Larry Kudlowâ€? on July 19 tells us that Trumpâ€™s adviser Larry Kudlow invented the absurd story that as China restricted foreign partyâ€™s share in US joint venture with China to below 50%, foreign party has to show Chinese party its blueprints so that the Chinese party can steal American partyâ€™s technology.That is really absurd. If a foreign party uses its technology in a joint venture with a Chinese party, it is utterly impossible to prevent its technology from being known by the Chinese party as it has to employ Chinese staff and workers. Creating job opportunities for China is a compulsory requirement for a Chinese-foreign joint venture. A foreign party is utterly unable to set up a joint venture with China if it refuses to employ Chinese staff and workers. Itâ€™s common sense that Chinese staff and workers will learn the technology in the course of the joint ventureâ€™s operation.To keep the technology confidential, a foreign enterprise has to set up a branch wholly owned by it. Even so, it has to have competent lawyers to help it keep its technology confidential by the establishment of a security system, preparation of compulsory non-disclosure documents for its staff and workers to sign, discovering, puting an end to and punishing infringement of the enterpriseâ€™s intellectual property, etc.Now, China has lifted most of the restrictions for US enterprises to set up wholly owned branches in China. In spite of that, Trump has started trade war with China and plans to intensify it.Under such circumstances, Xi would have been regarded as a fool if he could not have seen through Trumpâ€™s tricks. Xi certainly cannot give up his China dream and the Made in China 2025 to satisfy Trump. He has to fight back.Though full of lies, Hudlow at lease is correct that Xi would not accept US terms.However, Trump and Hudlow still have the illusion that US attacks may soften Xi and make him surrender so that they adopt the strategy of escalation, a stupid strategy as to win a war one has to concentrate all available force before oneâ€™s sudden powerful offensive.

"US President Donald Trump sets China tariff plan 01:46NEW DELHI: On Thursday, US President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China. In retaliation, China announced a list of US goods including pork, apples and steel pipe which may be hit with higher import duties. The face off between two economic heavyweights of the world has set alarm bells ringing for what is being billed as a trade war . Following is a breakdown of what has happened so far, what might be on the cards going forward, and where India finds itself in all this.As the term might suggest, a trade war is a situation where countries try to hamper each other's commerce. Generally, the process involves imposing hefty tariffs and restrictions on each other's produces. For example, if Country-A hikes import duty on the produces of Country-B, then its products become more expensive and thus less competitive in the Country-A's markets.Talks of a trade war started doing the rounds when earlier this month, US President Donald Trump declared that he will impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, dramatically raising the possibility of a trade showdown with China and other key trading partners, including European Union (EU) and India.About 10 days later, Trump blocked Singapore-based Broadcom's takeover of US chipmaker Qualcomm . The deal which could have been in the tune of $117 billion and was being dubbed as 'technology industry's biggest deal ever', got stalled with the US authorities fearing that the deal would allow Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies become the dominant supplier.On Thursday, US struck the latest blow by imposing fresh tariffs on Chinese imports. Following Trump's announcement, the US Trade Representative's office will present a list of products that could be targeted, primarily from the high-tech sector. Washington will also pursue alleged breaches of intellectual property law by China through the World Trade Organization (WTO).Following Trump's decision to increase tariffs on steel imports, India claimed that it does not expect any 'immediate dent' as only 2 per cent of its steel exports are to the US. However, major metal stocks like Tata Steel have taken a hit since the announcement. The broader market too has been extremely volatile since the turn of this month. Besides, the import tariff decision, US has also dragged India to the WTO for providing what it termed as export subsidies through half-a-dozen schemes. Even as India's commerce minister Suresh Prabhu called for a 'Ã§ommon ground', reports emerged that government is contemplating approaching the WTOâ€™s dispute settlement body against the US.At least four major WTO members â€” the European Union, Japan, South Korea and Brazil â€” on Tuesday attacked the US for increasing import duty on steel and aluminium. The sense of confrontation among various countries can be comprehended from what WTO chief Robert Azevedo said on Thursday -- 'Tit-for-tat situations tend to escalate'.After Trump's latest announcement, China said it is not afraid of a trade war with the US and announced plans for reciprocal tariffs on $3 billion of imports from the US. This aside, China has said it will also pursue legal action against the US at the WTO.Reports suggest that Trump's next potential target could be uranium imports. Uranium suppliers in US are invoking the same section of the Trade Expansion Act that the Trump administration used to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Chinaâ€™s $3 billion counter punch to Donald Trumpâ€™s tariffs is just the first move from the worldâ€™s second-largest economy, according to a Bloomberg report. One of the major retaliatory actions might be the cancellation of a $38 billion order to American aircraft maker Boeing , which China placed in 2015. Agriculture and technology are other major sectors where the Asian superpower may plan to hit back on US' $130 billion annual exports to China.(With agency inputs)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FPCCI officiÂ­al says countrÂ­y pursuiÂ­ng producÂ­t-based preferÂ­ential agreemÂ­entsKARACHI: As the US and China battle it out in a trade war, some of the other countries are reverting to the centuries-old barter system, but an â€˜upgradedâ€™ version of it.With the worldâ€™s two largest economies at each otherâ€™s throats on trade issues, there are some that are adopting open doors and liberal policies.Ahmed Zaman, head of research at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), says international trade has evolved as competition has intensified. In such a scenario, the centuries-old barter system has been revived, but with a different approach.World on brink of trade war as US slaps tariffs on alliesCountries are now adopting product-based preferential agreements, which could be looked upon as remodeled barter, the ancient form of trade where products were exchanged without the involvement of currency, according to a research paper Zaman has written.Zaman explained that the product-based agreement would involve a country eliminating tariffs and taxes on the import of a specific commodity. In return, the benefactor would reciprocate by extending a similar benefit to the other trading partner.He said that many countries are now adopting the model, including Iran, Russia and India. Moreover, Pakistan has also undertaken it with Iran, importing oil, while exporting kinnow and rice.â€œIf we donâ€™t have to pay customs or import duty to Kenya while exporting rice, then it will be cheaper for us, therefore the demand for our product increases,â€? Zaman told The Express Tribune.He added that if Pakistan wants to do that, it will also have to let Kenya export its tea to Pakistan as well, without imposing duties. Pakistan and Kenya are negotiating a product-specific free trade agreement (FTA) to enhance bilateral trade, which currently stands at $789 million, with the volume of Pakistanâ€™s exports at $319 million and imports at $468 million. Analytical examination shows that bilateral trade is confined to a few products, but is growing.â€˜Pakistan unlikely to suffer from US-China trade warâ€™Pakistan is the largest importer of Kenyan tea, with $592.84 million out of a total $1,424.43 million worth of tea shipments into the country. Similarly, Pakistan exports rice worth $229.104 million in the total import of $259.043 million to Kenya.Pharmaceutical products comprise $6.36 million out of total Kenyan pharmaceutical imports of $518.28 million. Other items that have a major share in Pakistanâ€™s export basket to Kenya are textile and furniture. Besides exports, Pakistani investors have also entered in the auto, pharmaceutical and textile sectors.â€œIf India levies duties on Pakistanâ€™s rice and its cost becomes higher than elsewhere in the market, then people would not prefer our rice. Certainly, the demand for Pakistanâ€™s rice would be lower.â€?He said the Planning Commission, which has been preparing the 12th five-year plan, has mentioned in the document that tea producers will be given subsidy in order to encourage them to enter the business.â€œThis will only contribute to budget and fiscal anomalies. The weather and other conditions in Pakistan are not favourable to produce tea. It will always cost us more than importing it from Kenya. Thereâ€™s a need to produce commodities like rice instead, which we can do better,â€? he added.â€œDifferent countries tend to excel in different sectors, like the US excels in arms, ammunition and machinery. Although Pakistan has struggled recently, it could excel in the agricultural sector,â€? the research head explained.With the recent volatility in rupee making trade-related investments difficult, product-based preferential trade agreements would help stabilise to some extent the impact in such cases, he added, referring to the 22% decline in the Pakistani currency in the last eight months.Published in The Express Tribune, July 24th, 2018.Like Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.Read full story",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - The United States is not starting a trade war but trying to level the playing field of global commerce and fend off Chinese protectionism, including a â€œdirect threatâ€? in high-tech goods, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Wednesday.Ross was speaking a day after Washington imposed steep import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels, billed as a way to protect American jobs by President Donald Trump, who is widely expected to take further action on steel, aluminium and intellectual property.â€œThe Chinese have been for quite a little while been superb at free trade rhetoric and even more superb at highly protectionist behaviour,â€? Ross said.The â€œnext area of challengeâ€? would be Chinaâ€™s high tech ambitions under its 2025 plan, which aimed to make China a world leader with enormous market share â€œin most all of the new technologies that you can name and spellâ€?, Ross said.â€œThat is a direct threat. And it is a direct threat that is being implemented by technology transfers, by disrespect for intellectual property rights, by commercial espionage, by all kinds of very bad things. So it isnâ€™t just the overcapacity in the historic industries.â€?He said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was working very hard on investigating on intellectual property, but his report was not expected for some time.David W.

REUTERS/Denis BalibouseRoss was speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, alongside business leaders and World Trade Organization chief Roberto Azevedo, who said he expected China to dispute Trumpâ€™s trade challenges.â€œI think China is going to respond to those complaints, saying that that is within the rules,â€? Azevedo said.Earlier on Tuesday Jack Ma, the founder of Chinaâ€™s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), said he was scared by the prospect of a trade war, which he described as a disaster.â€œIf you want to launch a trade war itâ€™s easy, but it takes about 30 years to fix that pain,â€? Ma said.Ross played down the idea that the United States was starting a trade war.â€œNobody is trying to ignite a gigantic thing like Smoot-Hawley did during the Depression,â€? he said, referring to a protectionist 1930 law that raised thousands of U.S. tariffs.Slideshow (2 Images)But he also gave a nonchalant response to South Koreaâ€™s vow to challenge the latest U.S. tariffs at the WTO.â€œThe fact that they may get a favourable decision (at the WTO) doesnâ€™t mean that itâ€™s a correct decision,â€? he said.HAND-WRITTEN NOTESTrumpâ€™s administration has also been accused of courting a trade war by vetoing new WTO appeals judges, hobbling the trade dispute settlement system and running the risk that trade friction will explode into tit-for-tat actions.The United States has not said what would persuade it to lift its veto on WTO judges and Ross declined to elaborate.â€œI think we should negotiate that in the conference room not in the press room,â€? he said.Azevedo said the United States had concerns about the system after it exposed shortcomings in its trade practices and said the U.S. veto would significantly slow litigation, but may not stop it altogether.Ross, who was clutching a pad with notes hand-written in blue ink, reading â€œNAFTA, Tax Reform, POTUS@Davos, Tariffsâ€?, said the United States had supported the world trading system for too long without demanding reform.But he steered away from suggestions that the United States was giving up on the WTO, saying that the world still needed an arbiter and needed to avoid â€œa total free-for-allâ€?, even if it did not agree with every aspect.â€œWe donâ€™t intend to abrogate leadership but leadership is different from being a sucker and being a patsy,â€? he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude hit its highest level since 2014 on Monday amid rising concerns that Venezuelaâ€™s oil output could fall further following the countryâ€™s presidential election and potential sanctions on the OPEC-member nation.Gasoline prices are shown in Carlsbad, California, U.S., May 21, 2018. REUTERS/Mike BlakePrices firmed further as U.S. President Donald Trump had discussions with Russia and China about issuing new debt to Venezuela. Trump signed an executive order on Monday restricting Venezuelaâ€™s ability to liquidate state assets, a senior administration official told reporters.Any restriction on Venezuelaâ€™s financing, logistics or power supply could further depress the countryâ€™s crude output.â€œItâ€™s been going down for a bit, but there is an expectation that the decline will accelerate,â€? said Jamie Webster, senior director of the Center for Energy Impact at the Boston Consulting Group. â€œThereâ€™s increasingly a view that this could be as bad as Libya was in its worst days - that production could fall to a very small percent of what it is capable of doing.â€?U.S. crude futures settled 96 cents, or 1.4 percent, firmer at $72.24 a barrel, after touching $72.33, the highest since November 2014.

In post-settlement trade, the global benchmark rallied to $79.59, up more than a dollar from the previous close.Venezuelaâ€™s socialist President Nicolas Maduro faced widespread international condemnation on Monday after his re-election in a weekend vote his critics denounced as a farce cementing autocracy in the crisis-stricken oil producer.The United States is actively considering oil sanctions on Venezuela, where output has dropped by a third in two years to its lowest in decades.â€œThe spectre of U.S. oil sanctions on the embattled Latin American producer now looms large as Washington strives to tighten the financial noose,â€? PVM Oil Associates strategist Stephen Brennock said in a note.Brent pushed past $80 a barrel last week for the first time since 2014, and the market may again try to clear that hurdle, said Gene McGillian, vice president of research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.â€œIt seems as if the pull backs are just short-term profit taking and we will see whether people are going to be willing to drive the market through $80 again,â€? he said.Beyond Venezuelaâ€™s production woes, geopolitical concerns that U.S. sanctions on Iran could curb the countryâ€™s crude exports have led prices to trade higher in recent weeks.Additionally, a possible U.S. trade war with China is â€œon holdâ€? after the worldâ€™s two largest economies agreed to drop their tariff threats while they work on a wider trade agreement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday, giving global markets a lift in early Monday trade.Stabilizing trade relations between the countries could boost oil demand, Traditionâ€™s McGillian said.Rising output from U.S. shale and key OPEC producers could end the rally, BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters. Dudley said he expected a flood of U.S. shale and a possible reopening of OPEC taps to cool oil markets after crude rose above $80 a barrel last week.Dudley said he saw oil prices falling to between $50 and $65 because of surging shale output and OPECâ€™s capacity to boost production to cover a potential shortfall in Iranian supplies owing to U.S. sanctions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has increased tariffs by up to 25 percent on 128 U.S. products, from frozen pork and wine to certain fruits and nuts, escalating a dispute between the worldâ€™s biggest economies in response to U.S. duties on imports of aluminium and steel.The tariffs, which take effect on Monday, were announced late on Sunday by Chinaâ€™s finance ministry and matched a list of possible tariffs on up to $3 billion in U.S. goods published by China on March 23.Soon after the announcement, an editorial in the widely read Global Times newspaper warned that if the United States had thought China would not retaliate or would only take symbolic countermeasures, it could â€œsay goodbye to that delusionâ€?.â€œEven though China and the U.S. have not publicly said they are in a trade war, the sparks of such a war have already started to fly,â€? the newspaper said.The Ministry of Commerce said it was suspending its obligations to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to reduce tariffs on 120 U.S. goods, including fruit and ethanol. The tariffs on those products will be raised by an extra 15 percent.Eight other products, including pork and scrap aluminium, would now be subject to additional tariffs of 25 percent, it said, with the measures effective starting April 2.â€œChinaâ€™s suspension of its tariff concessions is a legitimate action adopted under WTO rules to safeguard Chinaâ€™s interests,â€? the finance ministry said.China is moving swiftly with retaliatory action amid escalating trade tension with the United States, which has rocked global financial markets in the past week as investors fear a full-blown trade dispute between the two economic superpowers will damage world growth.In response to Chinaâ€™s move, Washington said Beijingâ€™s subsidies and overcapacity were behind the action on steel.â€œInstead of targeting fairly traded U.S. exports, China needs to stop its unfair trading practices which are harming U.S national security and distorting global markets,â€?

"How Changes To NAFTA Could Affect TradeIn its 24-year history, NAFTA, which was established to set rules for the exchange of goods and services between the United States, Canada and Mexico, has remained unchanged. Though mostly favorable, reception of NAFTA has been mixed. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump declared NAFTA as the worst trade deal in US history and cited it with the demise of the nationâ€™s manufacturing industry. While all three countries agree that NAFTA should be updated to reflect our modern economy, Mexico and Canada were reluctant to participate as President Trump spearheaded the renegotiations in August of 2017.Conversations so far have been cumbersome. An agreement was originally expected to come at the end of last year, however, new projections for completion are creeping into 2019. Also uncertain is what the finished product will look like. While a modernized NAFTA could increase market opportunities for American businesses, there is a possibility the agreement will cease to exist. Losing NAFTA would have serious repercussions for Utahâ€™s economy. This is especially true for Utahâ€™s agricultural and food industry, which attributed 17.6 percent of its total exports to Mexico and Canada in 2016.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Jake Neher/ WDETPresident Donald Trump stunned Washington and much of the global business world when he announced â€” seemingly in a spur of the moment decision â€” that he wants to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Leaders from around the world reacted with alarm and threatened a trade war with the possibility of raising tariffs on American-made products such as Harley motorcycles, Kentucky bourbon, and blue jeans.Trump says he isnâ€™t afraid of a trade war and that it would be easy for America to win.Another startling twist to another confounding moment in the Trump presidency was the strong resistance Trump received this week from Congressional leaders within his own party.Jordan Fabian, White House correspondent with The Hill, joins Detroit Today with Stephen Henderson to talk about this story and the fallout in Washington.â€œHeâ€™s not going to have a ton of defenders in his own party to go out and explain to their voters why the president is doing this,â€? says Fabian. â€?Heâ€™s almost alone on an island on this one.â€?But Fabian notes that this is the kind of policy that appeals directly to Trumpâ€™s base in places like Michigan, where voters gravitated to his tough stance on trade policies they feel have hurt their pocket books.â€œA lot of people last week were surprised in Washington that the president made this announcement,â€? he says. â€?And I was almost a little surprised at the surprise.â€?Henderson also speaks with Ravi Anupindi, an expert on global supply chains at UMâ€™s Ross School of Business.Anupindi says this doesnâ€™t appear to be a real threat to China, and the steel industry controlled by that country.â€œIt seems like this is a weapon he is using to get something out of the NAFTA negotiations,â€? says Anupindi.Click on the audio player above to hear the full conversation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"JANESVILLE (WKOW) â€” First Congressional District candidate Bryan Steil announced the endorsements of farmers from across Southeast Wisconsin at a gathering at a Janesville farm.The Republican faces Democrat Randy Bryce for House Speaker Paul Ryanâ€™s seat. Steil weighed in on issues important to farmers like the trade war and the expiration of the Farm Bill.That bill is expected to be called for a vote after Novemberâ€™s election but some farmers say theyâ€™re in a pinch not knowing if the risk management program they need to qualify for operating loans will even be there. Without passage of a new spending package or an extension, it leaves dozens of programs in limbo until Congress votes.Steil said if elected, he has plans to continue trade deals that are good for the agriculture industry.â€œIt should be a nonpartisan analysis on how we put policies in place that help farmers and in particular we could do a lot with trade to have access to markets so our farmers can ship their products freely and fairly around the globe,â€? said Steil.Tariffs were also discussed â€” a big issue in the farming industry and a regulation that Steil said will continue to have benefits as long as the second phase goes into effect.â€œI want access to markets like the dairy market in Canada,â€? said Steil. â€œWe want to see the next chapter of these negotiations quickly so we have access to free and reciprocal trade so there are lower barriers in trade.â€?Steilâ€™s opponent Randy Bryce is not opposed to tariffs but believes President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade war has created tensions with strong allies.Bryce also believes retaliatory tariffs imposed by other nations will have a negative impact on farmersâ€™ crops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"â€œTo meet the growing consumption needs of the Chinese people and the need for high-quality economic development, China will significantly increase purchases of United States goods and services.

The United States will send a team to China to work out the details.â€?The delegations also agreed to step up their trade in manufactured goods and services. Furthermore, China committed to amending its laws on intellectual property protection, including the Patent Law, which was one of the major concerns voiced earlier by the U.S.The trade talks will hold off the announced imposition of tariffs by the Trump Administration on China worth up to USD 150 billion, as well as Chinaâ€™s retaliation measures.This is a very important milestone taking into account that trade between China and the USA accounts for roughly 4 percent of global trade, which means that a dispute between the two would damage considerably the global trade patterns.The consensus is expected to curb the further erosion of the drybulk marketâ€™s recovery, since the sector has already started to feel an aftertaste of the trade war, especially after Chinaâ€™s extension of tariffs on imports from the US to several more agricultural products including soybeans.The tariffs posed a threat for U.S. ports as well, as they would reduce steel and aluminum imports and exports, putting dockworkers and countless others in the supply chain out of work.With regard to the container shipping market, the industryâ€™s volumes on the essential leg of a transpacific voyage from China into the US would have been impacted considerably if the trade war continued brewing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"WASHINGTON â€“ The U.S. slapped tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese imports on Monday, ratcheting up ongoing trade tensions between the worldâ€™s two largest economic powers.In a statement, President Donald Trump announced he has directed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to impose the new tariffs in response to what he said are unfair trade practices by China.â€œAs president, it is my duty to protect the interests of working men and women, farmers, ranchers, businesses, and our country itself,â€? Trump said. â€œMy administration will not remain idle when those interests are under attack.â€?The tariffs, announced after financial markets in the U.S. closed, will take effect on Sept. 24 and will initially be set at a rate of 10 percent. That rate will jump to 25 percent on Jan. 1.China's Commerce Ministry said Tuesday it will take â€œcounter-measures,â€? but gave no further details.The announcement means the Trump administration has now levied duties on a total $250 billion worth of Chinese goods â€“ roughly half of the Chinese-made products shipped into the U.S. China has retaliated by placing duties on an equal dollar amount of U.S. goods and threatened retaliatory tariffs on another $60 billion in U.S. products in response to the Trump administrationâ€™s latest actions.Sign up for the daily Snapshot newsletter Sign up for the daily Snapshot Newsletter Something went wrong.

If he follows through with that threat, virtually every product imported into the U.S. from China would be subject to a tariff.U.S. officials said they remain open to discussions with China to resolve the trade dispute but warned that China must be willing to change its ways and refrain from unfair trade practices, including theft of U.S. technology and intellectual property.China reportedly was planning to send one of its top economic officials to Washington later this month in an attempt to jump-start the talks. It was unclear whether the Chinese would be willing to go ahead with that meeting after the latest round of tariffs.â€œFor months, we have urged China to change these unfair practices and give fair and reciprocal treatment to American companies,â€? Trump said. â€œWe have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made, and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly. But, so far, China has been unwilling to change its practices.â€?China has had many opportunities to fully address U.S. concerns, Trump said.â€œOnce again, I urge Chinaâ€™s leaders to take swift action to end their countryâ€™s unfair trade practices,â€? he said. â€œHopefully, this trade situation will be resolved, in the end, by myself and President Xi (Jinping) of China, for whom I have great respect and affection.â€?FILE - In this Monday, April 2, 2018, file photo, women push a shopping cart near nuts and sweets imported from the United States and other countries displayed on a section selling imported foods at a supermarket in Beijing.

(AP Photo/Andy Wong, FIle) ORG XMIT: BKWS104Andy Wong, APThe tariffs are the latest volley in a tit-for-tat trade war that started over the summer, when the U.S. imposed a 25 percent duty that affected $34 billion in Chinese imports, including farm equipment, motor vehicles, medical equipment and products made of aluminum and steel. That was followed by a second round of tariffs on $16 billion in Chinese goods.China responded by slapping an extra 25 percent duty on 545 products from the United States, including soybeans, electric cars, orange juice, whiskey, salmon and cigars.Trump then suggested another round of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. In July, the U.S. Trade Representativeâ€™s office released a list of product lines that it said would potentially be impacted, including fish and other foods, handbags, luggage and wood products used in construction.At a series of hearings held last month, scores of U.S. companies and groups representing the bridal industry, candle makers, handbag designers, bicycle-parts distributors and others implored the Trump administration not to go forward with additional tariffs.The administration received more than 6,000 written comments and heard testimony from more than 350 witnesses, many of whom argued that new tariffs would be catastrophic for their businesses.After reviewing the comments, the administration said it had agreed to remove more than 300 product lines from the list and exempt them from the latest round of tariffs.The exempted products include certain electronic consumer products, such as smart watches and Bluetooth devices; certain chemicals for manufactured goods, textile and agriculture; and certain health and safety products, such as bicycle helmets, rubber and plastic gloves, and child-safety furniture such as highchairs, car seats and playpens.Still, trade analysts warned that the latest round of tariffs would hit a broad range of consumer goods and would be felt especially hard by low- and middle-income Americans.â€œThe Trump administrationâ€™s latest round of tariffs on imports from China are a direct tax on millions of working American families,â€? said Daniel Griswold of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. â€œThe tax revenue the president brags about raising will come straight from the pockets of the people he claims to represent.â€?Rep. Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, said the tariffs show that Trump is clearly ratcheting up pressure on China to come to the table â€“ and the sooner, the better.â€œThere is no disagreement between Congress and the president that we must hold China accountable for hurting U.S. companies and workers on a colossal scale by extorting our companies to transfer their best technology, stealing our intellectual property and shoring up Chinaâ€™s state-run companies through subsidies and other distortive practices,â€? Brady said.At the same time, Brady said he worries that additional tariffs will mean Americans will be forced to pay extra for imported goods. He urged Trump and Chinese President Xi to develop a long-term solution that levels the playing field for American manufacturers, farmers and workers.More: Tariffs on imported cars, parts could harm U.S. economy and auto industry, experts warnMore: China files complaint to WTO over US plan for tariffs on $200 billion of goods",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As he embarks on a multi-state trip through parts of the country hit heavily by ongoing trade disputes, President Donald Trump is preparing to direct billions of dollars to farmers whose crops have been hurt by tariffs.Responding to farm groups and Republican criticism on Capitol Hill, the administration has been working for months on a plan to shore up slipping prices for soybeans, pork and other crops hit with retaliatory tariffs from China.The administration is expected to announce the aid package Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the plan, in the same week Trump is traveling to Missouri, Illinois and Iowa to speak with veterans and stump for candidates in this year's midterm elections.The proposal to stabilize farmers, some of whom have watched prices tumble amid ongoing trade disputes, is a recognition that Trumpâ€™s tariffs are having a short-term impact on the agriculture sector heading into the elections and also that there is no clear end in sight to escalating trade battles.Sign up for the daily Snapshot newsletter Sign up for the daily Snapshot Newsletter Something went wrong.

"US trade war takes a bite out of Apple as supplier abandons China for VietnamPostedThe Chinese company that assembles Apple's AirPods is moving its production from China to Vietnam, as the US-China trade war escalates following US tariffs on some $US250 billion in Chinese goods.Key points Companies operating in China blame the trade war for their downturnsTaiwanese and Japanese manufacturers are abandoning ChinaChina is moving to more advanced manufacturing as part of Made in China 2025Earlier this month, GoerTek, based in eastern China's Shandong province, asked all suppliers involved in its AirPod production to ship all necessary materials and components directly to Vietnam, according to a report in the Nikkei Asian Review.The ABC has obtained Goertek's 2018 biannual report, in which the company's chairman Jiang Bin revealed that net profit had decreased by 38.11 per cent, down from $140 million compared to the same period last year.'Due to macro-economic factors â€” such as external market fluctuations and China-US trade disputes â€” the company's operation and management has become more difficult,' Mr Jiang said in the report.This is despite United States President Donald Trump saying he would spare high tech products like AirPods in the last round of tariffs late last month.On Tuesday, GoerTek also announced plans to invest $200 million in smart earphone and drone production in Nanning in southern China, closer to its Vietnamese operations where it would potentially be easier for cross border logistics.But GoerTek is not the only company to shift its operations due to the trade war.Earlier this month, Taiwanese officials revealed that almost 30 enterprises had abandoned China and relocated to Taiwan, citing impact from the trade war.Founder of Taiwanese think-tank GoldenRock Jason Wu said many more Taiwanese entrepreneurs wished to leave China, not just because of the trade war, but also because of the tense political climate under President Xi Jinping.'Many Taiwanese entrepreneurs are still watching closely,' Mr Wu told the ABC.'Because in addition to the trade war, the tightening of the political and economic environment and financial difficulties in China are also reasons why Taiwanese entrepreneurs might prefer migrating to somewhere else.'Mr Wu said Taiwan had contributed significantly to China's manufacturing industry over the past generation, especially in electronics and manufacturing, because China offered generous conditions to Taiwanese businesses.From Made in China to Made in South-East AsiaJapanese companies in China are also reportedly being impacted by the escalating trade war.The eastern city of Suzhou, home to a large number of foreign manufacturers, had seen a number of Japanese manufacturing companies close down operations permanently since last year, according to Chinese state-owned media 21st Century Business Herald.Japanese manufacturing giant Omron, which produces LED screens for a variety of electronic products, announced the closure of its company in Suzhou three months after Samsung shut down its factory in Shenzhen, which is recognised as one of China's innovation and technology hubs.China's leaders, however, may not be as concerned as some might expect, as the country's manufacturing industry is currently attempting to upgrade and move away from its labour intensive, heavy manufacturing past towards a high-tech future.The country's electronics industry was valued at more than $3.5 trillion in 2017 and is expected to grow further as the country pursues its Made in China 2025 strategy, which is promoting high precision and digitised manufacturing to give China a competitive advantage as the global economy changes.In some cases, inland cities such as Chongqing and Chengdu in the Sichuan province have welcomed labour-intensive manufacturing factories like electronic assembly, while other manufacturers have moved to South-East Asian countries including Vietnam, Cambodia, and Malaysia where labour costs were lower.Professor Hans Hendrischke from the University of Sydney said this trend was occurring irrespective of the trade war, because China was moving up the value chain and becoming a more economically developed nation, producing more sophisticated equipment and higher value products as its workforce acquires more skills.However, he did believe the trend was 'accelerated' by the increased tariffs, and would have a negative impact on China's economy.Topics: business-economics-and-finance, industry, manufacturing, globalisation---economy, economic-trends, world-politics, china, taiwan, japan, vietnam, asia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, China pledged to take â€œcorresponding measures of equal scale and strength against U.S. products in accordance with Chinese lawâ€?.Separately, Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Commerce also said in a statement that it will â€? immediately bring relevant U.S. practice to the dispute settlement body of the WTO, and is ready to take counter measures on U.S. products with the same intensity and scale that will be published in the coming days.â€?On the data frontAustralia retail sales 0.6% mom in February, above expectation of 0.3% mom.

Near term trend could have reversed with head and shoulder top pattern (ls: 1.3000; h: 1.3124; rs: 1.2942). Sustained trading below 1.2789 will confirm this case. It will also indicate rejection by 1.3065 fibonacci level. Deeper fall would than be seen back to 1.2246 support next. On the upside, though, break of 1.2942 will indicate support from 1.2789 and turn bias back to the upside for 1.3124.In the bigger picture, outlooks is turned a bit mixed again. Strong support was seen from 50% retracement of 0.9406 (2011 low) to 1.4689 (2015 high) at 1.2048. But there was no follow through buying above 38.2% retracement of 1.4689 to 1.2061 at 1.3065. Rejection by 1.3065 will argue that price action from 1.2061 is merely a three wave corrective pattern.

"The Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen ended last week as the strongest major currencies. Sentiments were hurt deeply by worries on global trade war. Over week, DOW lost -2.03%, S&P 500 lost -0.89%, DAX was down -3.31%, CAC dropped -2.08%, Nikkei lowered by -1.47%. Chinaâ€™s Shanghai composite suffered most by declining -4.37%. FTSE was the rare gain and ended the week up 0.63%. Canadian Dollar and New Zealand Dollar ended as the weakest ones after weak economic data. In particular, poor retail sales from Canada has most likely ruled out the chance of a July BoC hike. Even though oil price staged a strong rebound on much smaller than expected output raise by OPEC, boost to the Loonie was limited. Also, Sterling was the third weakest one as there wasnâ€™t enough sustainable buying after more hawkish than expected BoE rate decision.Trade tensions escalate on all front, the worst is yet to come- advertisement -Letâ€™s have a recap on global trade war developments first. US President Donald Trump ignored warning from industry groups and disgarded all previous agreements during the negotiations with China. The US Trade Representative announced to impose Section 301 tariffs on USD 34B in China imports in the first phase on June 15, effective July 6. China quickly announced retaliation to to USD 34B in US products including soybean, agricultural products, automobiles, effective July 6 too. Trump then ordered the USTR, on July 19, to study additional 10% tariffs on USD 200B worth of Chinese products, in response to Chinaâ€™s retaliation. China vowed to fight back with â€œqualitativeâ€? and â€œquantitativeâ€? for any additional tariffs.During last week, there were reports that there is a split in the White House on the way to handle trade dispute with China. And some are pushing to restart the negotiations before the above mentioned tariffs come into effect. But to us thatâ€™s more smokescreen than anything. If Trumpâ€™s attention is to get some sort of â€œdealâ€? out of the talks, negotiations wonâ€™t be stopped so abruptly. And it will certainly not be followed by strong words that raises the tension further. Trump has already demonstrated his way of negotiating in good faith by giving all the concessions on North Koreaâ€™s empty promises.US-China trade war is now no longer a so called â€œtacticâ€? but a reality thatâ€™s gradually coming true. Also, The stakes that Trump raised already exceed total amount of US imports to China. China would have to turn to non-tariff measures to counter US bullying. The impact of that could be even more destructive to the economies of both country.On another front, Trump stopped the temporary exemption on steel and aluminum tariffs for EU, Canada and Mexico on June 1. EU formally announced on June 20 its retaliation. The total EU exports to the US affected are valued at EUR 6.4B. For now, EU imposed US products in EUR 2.8B worth first, effective on Friday June 22, that was, yesterday. Duties on the remaining EUR 3.6B in US goods will take place at a later stage, â€œin three yearsâ€™ time or after a positive finding in WTO dispute settlements.After seeing no concession from the EU even though a â€œgun pointed to their headsâ€?, Trump is going to use a â€œbiggerâ€? gun to threaten his close allies. He said on Friday to impose 20% tariffs of cars if EU doesnâ€™t â€œremoveâ€? the trade barriers to US vehicles. He tweeted: â€œBased on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the U.S. and it great companies and workers by the European Union, if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!â€?European Commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen told French newspaper Le Monde that â€œif they decide to raise their import tariffs, weâ€™ll have no choice, again, but to react. And, he added that â€œWe donâ€™t want to fight (over trade) in public via Twitter. We should end the escalation.â€?The trade spats are not going to end any time soon. And, letâ€™s be reminded that NAFTA negotiation is unresolved, and the auto tariffs will have a big impact on both Canada and Mexico. We have certainly not seen the worst from Trump yet.DOW could be resuming medium term correction from 26616.71As we mentioned during the week, DOWâ€™s sharp fall argues that corrective rise from 23344.52 could have completed earlier than expected at 25402.83 already. Break of 24247.84 near term support will affirm this view and bring deeper fall through 23344.52 to extend the correction from 26616.71 high.Our medium term view remain unchanged. Correction from 26616.71 should extend to 38.2% retracement of 15450.56 to 26616.71 at 23351.24 before completion.The picture in S&P 500 is less bearish. With less confidence, weâ€™re favoring the case that choppy rise from 2553.80 is completed at 2791.49, ahead of 2801.90 resistance. Break of 55 day EMA at 2725.92 will be the first sign that affirm this view. Further break of 2676.81 should bring deeper fall through 2553.80 support.Medium term outlook is similar to DOW though. Correction from 2872.87 is extended to extend with another fall to 38.2% retracement of 1810.10 to 2872.87 at 2466.89 before completion.DAX reversing near term trendDAXâ€™s break of 12547.81 support suggests that rebound from 11726.62 has completed at 13204.31 already. Deeper fall is in favor to 12312.27 support. Firm break there will confirm this bearish case and target 11726.62 key support level next.More importantly, the weekly chart shows a possibly head and shoulder top pattern (ls: 12951.54, h: 13596.89, rs: 13204.31). Firm break of 12726.62 could mark a change in long term trend.Chinese stock markets could worsen very quicklyNow, letâ€™ move to the worst performing one, the Shanghai Composite. The SSE gapped through a psychological importantly 3000 handle last week, reached as low as 2837.14, before closing at 2889.76. Itâ€™s clear that medium term corrective rise from 2638.30 has completed at 3587.03, ahead of 38.2% retracement of 5178.19 to 2638.30 at 3587.03.The downside acceleration now suggests that fall from 3587.03 is an impulsive move. That is, itâ€™s resuming the fall from 5178.19, rather than extending the sideway pattern from 2638.30 as the second leg. That is, the risk of break through 2638.30 low to next key support at 2013 low at 1849.65 has surged sharply. Barring intervention by the authoritarian Chinese government, the stock markets in China could worse very quickly ahead.Dollar index still on track to 97.87 fibonacci resistanceDollar indexâ€™s break of 95.15 resistance last week was unconvincing. Thatâ€™s primarily due to resilience in Euro due to data, and strength in Yen on risk aversion. Nonetheless, further rise is expected as long as 93.19 support holds, even in case of deeper retreat. Current rebound from 88.25 should target 61.8% retracement of 103.82 to 88.25 at 97.82.WTI surged on smaller than expected oil production hikeOn Saturday, major non-OPEC oil producing countries met with OPEC representatives and endorsed the output increases the latter agreed on Friday. The nominal target is 1 million barrels a day of production raise. In real terms, itâ€™s believed to be at 600k-700k barrels a day as some countries are unable to raise their output. Saudi Arabia and Russia are seen as the biggest winner out of the deal and they hold most spare capacity. Both stand ready to eat up the market share with US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. There is no details on the split between OPEC and non-OPEC producers yet.WTI crude oil on Friday as the increase was much smaller than the worst expected. The pull back from 72.83 is likely finished at 63.59, ahead of 38.2% retracement of 42.05 to 72.83 at 61.07. Further rebound is in favor to retest 72.83. At this point, weâ€™re not anticipating a break there yet as the medium term consolidation pattern from 72.83 could take some more time to develop.USD/CHF Weekly OutlookUSD/CHF dropped sharply towards the end of last week. The development suggests that rebound from 0.9787 has completed at 0.9989 already. More importantly, the corrective pattern from 1.0056 is extending. Initial bias remains on the downside this week for 0.9787 and below. Though, weâ€™d expect strong support from 0.9720/4 cluster support (38.2% retracement of 0.9186 to 1.0056 at 0.9724, 100% projection of 1.0056 to 0.9787 from 0.9989 at 0.9720) to bring rebound. On the upside, above 0.9989 will bring retest of 1.0056 high first.In the bigger picture, medium term decline from 1.0342 has completed with three waves down to 0.9186. Rise from there is currently viewed as a leg inside the long term range pattern. Hence, while further rally would be seen, weâ€™d be cautious on strong resistance from 1.0342 to limit upside. For now, further rise is expected as long as 38.2% retracement of 0.9186 to 1.0056 at 0.9724 holds. However, sustained break of 0.9724 will dampen this bullish view and would at least bring deeper fall to 61.8% retracement at 0.9518.In the long term picture, price actions from 0.7065 (2011 low) are not clearly impulsive yet. Thus, weâ€™ll treat it as developing into a corrective pattern, at least, until a firm break of 1.0342 resistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fade the Trade War HypeMarkets are on a knife-edge. US President Trumps imposing new trade sanctions against China has meaningfully increased the probability of a trade war. China is unlikely to site idly buy this time around. While at the EU summit, which is expected to discuss the US steel and aluminum tariffs. Asia markets were lower across the board while safe haven CHF and JPY were the only real gainers in FX. Yet, picking trend in FX remains complicated and markets tries to pick winners and losers from an extended protectionism. Countries with significant export exposure to the US such as MXN have declined yet, counties with solid domestic and lower reliance on exports such as India remains supportive.Surprisingly in this corned generally beta sensitive ZAR has also improved (marginally helped by gold trade). There still expectations for a favorable outcome with limited escalations based on negotiations and in our view Trump his using issue for political gain rather than actual trade repositioning. This action gives Trump a nice bullet point for stump speeches on the 2020 campaign trail. But he gains little from sparking a full-blown trade war. In addition, countries still taking grievances to WTO indicated trade remain within a management framework. Despite the intensifying hype we see this as an opportunity to reload in EM long positions.

On Japan side, Nikkei 225 dropped by -4.51%, followed by Topix (-3.62%).Chinese retaliation measures did not take long to come as Chinese trade ministry communicated its willingness to impose tariffs on US imports on pork, fruits, nuts, wine and other construction-related products. Additionally, China is planning to initiate infringement procedures to the World Trade Organization concerning recent introduced iron and aluminum tariffs. The outcome wonâ€™t probably get anywhere, everything is about baring the teeth and putting economic matter aside.

"President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to hammer European automotive companies with steep tariffs as his global trade war snowballed into a third day.Trump, in a series of Twitter posts while at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, appeared to be responding to warnings from European leaders that his promised tariffs on aluminum and steel would trigger retaliation from numerous major U.S. trading partners.Bring it on, Trump seemed to say.'If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!' Trump tweeted Saturday.On Thursday, Trump shocked the world â€“ and many of his top advisers â€“ with an off-the-cuff announcement that the United States would impose a tariff of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports. Canada's leadership said they would retaliate with tariffs on U.S. exports, and European leaders said they would as well, targeting Kentucky bourbon, Harley Davidson motorcycles, and blue jeans.On Friday, Trump wrote in another Twitter post that 'trade wars are good, and easy to win.' He also promised to enact what he called 'RECIPROCAL TAXES' on any country that has a tariff against any U.S. good or service.His attack on European automakers is mostly a direct threat at Germany, which exported $23 billion in cars to the United States in 2016, according to data aggregated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But large German automakers also have a sizable presence in the United States, with BMW employing thousands of workers in South Carolina and Volkswagen employing thousands more in Tennessee. Those manufacturers produce hundreds of thousands of cars in the U.S. each year, many of which are later exported to buyers in Asia and Europe.Trump often looks at trade relationships as a zero-sum game, complaining that the United States buys more goods and services from other countries than it sells to them. To that end, U.S. firms sold $53 billion in exports and imported $118 billion in goods to Germany last year, the kind of dynamic that he has often complained about.But critics of Trump's approach have often complained that tariffs and trade wars only drive up costs for domestic consumers, a move that would make German cars more expensive for U.S. consumers. Trump has also said these sorts of threats could incentivize foreign companies to expand their U.S. operations, so they don't have to pay the import fees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Demetri Sevastopulo, Sam Fleming and Shawn Donnan by Steven Mnuchin was having a tough day. For several months the Treasury secretary had tried to co-ordinate the US side in trade negotiations with China. But on May 29, he found himself explaining to Liu He, the Chinese Vice-Premier, why President Donald Trump had just reneged on a deal aimed at preventing a trade war. Two weeks earlier, Mnuchin hosted Liu at CafÃ© Milano, a Georgetown restaurant popular among Washington's diplomatic corps and Trump officials. Four days after the dinner, Mnuchin announced that the threatened trade war was now 'on hold' and that the US would not place tariffs on $US50 billion of Chinese goods. Yet, as he returned to work after the Memorial day weekend, he was met with the news that Trump had resurrected the tariffs. In a stark example of how the President can blindside his officials, Mnuchin had been told the announcement would come the next day, according to a senior official. The Trump administration is now fighting trade battles on several fronts with friends and rivals, leaving governments scrambling to decipher what is negotiating bluster and what is actual policy.Play Video Replay Video Trump's parting G7 message: 'everybody's robbing' the USAs Trump arrived at the G7 summit in Canada on Friday some of Washington's closest allies were irate at new US tariffs on steel and aluminium. So sharp are the tensions that Trump at one stage considered not going. AdvertisementInside the administration, the view described by a number of current and former officials is one that more resembles chaos. The erratic course of the trade talks has been partly driven by fierce infighting among officials who have been sarcastically dubbed 'The Magnificent Seven' by critics. There is little, if any, policy process to guide the US side. Most of all, there is a President determined to keep his campaign promise to get tough on trade but with little consensus on how to proceed. 'An unfortunate soundbite' As the debate within the administration has intensified, Mnuchin has started to play a bigger role â€“ especially after Congress passed a tax reform bill last December. Several people familiar with the situation say Liu had asked Hank Paulson, the former Treasury secretary, and other US financiers to convince him to play a bigger role. Some hoped he would tamp down the factional fighting particularly as Gary Cohn, the pro-free-trade head of the National Economic Council, was about to resign because of his opposition to the imposition of tariffs.President Donald Trump disembarks from Air Force One. Allies of the President argue that he is upending the orthodox order in a way that will produce results. SeongJoon ChoIt has not played out that way. Following Mnuchin's 'on hold' remark, Wilbur Ross, the Commerce secretary, said the deal was not 'definitive' and tariffs were still on the cards. Peter Navarro, a trade adviser to the President who had failed to turn up for the CafÃ© Milano dinner following several fights with Mnuchin earlier in Beijing, described the Treasury secretary's comment as 'an unfortunate soundbite'. Some former officials are even more direct. Steve Bannon, the former White House strategist, says China was scared of Trump. 'You are always going to have guys like Mnuchin who fumble the ball,' he told the Financial Times. But others argue that Mnuchin is the only official who understands what is feasible in terms of a deal. 'The Chinese like Mnuchin because he realises what other administration officials won't admit â€“ that the tariff threats have put us in a box and the only way out of the box is by negotiating towards an acceptable deal,' says Rob Porter, the former White House staff secretary who ran a weekly trade meeting to help co-ordinate policy among a diverse group of officials. Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State, is concerned that the trade threats are making relations more difficult with a host of countries, including China, which risked jeopardising the summit between Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un in Singapore, according to five people.Donald Trump listens during the G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council breakfast. Cole Burston'It's like a bad episode of Celebrity Apprentice,' says Chris Johnson, a former CIA China analyst. 'They're all gaming how to get back in the centre circle on a daily basis.' The recent disarray over trade has echoes of the early days of the administration when there was no inter-agency process and decisions were influenced by whomever gained access to Trump. The trade discussions began to adopt more structure after the start of Porter's weekly meeting. Threatened withdrawal Trump has threatened a US withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. But under intense pressure from the business community and Congress the President has stopped short and instead ordered a renegotiation of the pact which covers more than a quarter of the global economy.Steven Mnuchin, centre, leaves following a group photo during the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in Whistler. Darryl DyckReducing the US's $US337 billion annual trade deficit with China has been a persistent priority. The question is how. Some aides advocate a deal that would see Beijing increase purchases of farm exports and energy. Others argue long-term structural changes in China should be the goal. 'People were so desperate for structure that half the cabinet and most senior advisers showed up to Porter's meetings. Everyone wanted a seat at the table. For a time it was like the biggest show in the West Wing,' says a former administration official. He adds that the process ended after Porter left the White House in February when he was accused of spousal abuse, which he denies. One reason for the meeting's demise was because the participants, especially trade representative Robert Lighthizer, did not want to have to explain themselves to a big group of rivals. The end of the meetings has resulted in officials reverting to more Machiavellian ways. 'Several times, Ross has negotiated with the Chinese without keeping other people in the loop. But he never gets away with it,' says a person familiar with the internal deliberations.White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, left, walks with White House staff secretary Rob Porter. Once Porter had left the administration due to a domestic violence allegation, any order around trade vanished. Evan VucciIn one example, Ross tried to negotiate a steel-related deal that resulted in him receiving a blunt dressing down from Trump. The lack of structure also reflects Trump's background running a freewheeling family business. 'The person in charge has never seen process,' says one individual close to the White House. State of anarchy Chris Ruddy, a friend of Trump, says the President had made clear during the campaign that he was his own chief adviser and own general. 'It is a unitary organisation chart that starts and ends with Donald Trump. He doesn't want a lot of intermediaries.' With officials rising and falling, it has been almost impossible for governments to know who to make their case to. Beijing has searched for people to act as a bridge, including Blackstone chief executive Steven Schwarzman. 'The US is effectively in a state of anarchy,' says Lu Xiang at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. 'We always say Trump is a businessman, but even small shopkeepers know their most important asset is their reputation. Trump is harming his own reputation and that of the US.' Beyond the medieval court-style jockeying, Michael Smart, a former White House official, says the Trump officials were broadly split into two camps. 'There are some in the administration who believe that if we actually lower the hammer and apply these tariffs, the market access discussion is done [because the Chinese will walk away],' he says. 'There is another camp that says you won't have a good deal unless you impose tariffs and inflict pain. The latter group seems to be the majority.'Peter Navarro, director of the National Trade Council, is seen as a hawk on tariffs. Andrew HarrerMost experts see the latter camp as Lighthizer, Navarro and to a lesser degree Ross, while the first group is mainly of Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, the new head of the National Economic Council. Navarro and Lighthizer also believe that Mnuchin and Ross are too eager to secure short-term deals aimed at reducing the trade deficit at the expense of broader measures to change the way the Chinese economy operates. Navarro told the FT there were 'two structural problems' that needed solving. 'One is the chronic and persistent trade deficit with China that is resulting in a massive transfer of wealth, factories, and jobs from American shores. The second problem is to defend the crown jewels of American technology and intellectual property against Chinese theft, acquisition by state-backed funds, and forced transfer,' he says. 'You can't solve one problem by trading off the other so the whole notion of China simply agreeing to buy more American products in exchange for America surrendering its rights to impose Section 301 tariffs and investment restrictions in defence of our technologies and IP is a non-starter.' The limits of Mnuchin's influence were on display in Whistler, Canada, last weekend at a G7 finance ministers meeting, where he was upbraided for slapping tariffs on allies. The US had a $US151 billion transatlantic trade deficit in goods last year. The EU has so far resisted a White House effort to use steel tariffs to force broader negotiations on cars and other industrial goods. But more US tariffs â€“ including on cars â€“ may be coming. The President complains that the World Trade Organisation treats the US unfairly. The US's invocation of national security to apply tariffs has broken longstanding WTO taboos. Washington is also blocking the appointment of new judges in Geneva. Some fear the US may be gearing up to withdraw altogether. At the same time, Ross was in Beijing trying to negotiate a deal to sell more to China. Dennis Wilder, a former White House Asia adviser, says that when the Chinese asked Ross if he could guarantee there would be no tariffs, he replied that he had 'no authority' in that area.Wilbur Ross, US Commerce secretary, has tried to negotiate with the Chinese without keeping other people in the loop. Patrick T. FallonNever admits a mistake Another person believes the Chinese were baffled by the whole situation. 'They tried to embrace Mnuchin and do their part to anoint him the leader,' he says. 'Then Ross leads a delegation but they know his stock has been up and down. They don't want to deal with Lighthizer, but he gives the intellectual construct to what Trump thinks.' Max Baucus, a former US ambassador to China, says Beijing saw Trump as weak because he was 'very inexperienced and impulsive'. Some experts say Trump has become emboldened because few of his actions have created havoc in the markets. One person close to the White House says the danger now was that he was increasingly not listening to his advisers and was vaulting impulsively from decision to decision, sometimes without any vetting. 'Even when his actions anger friends and allies, Trump doubles down, never admits a mistake or concedes a weakness. He has decided that he has to take the reins on trade himself,' he says. 'Nobody speaks for the President on trade because he hasn't empowered anyone. But he can't even speak for himself because he hasn't decided what to do yet.' But allies of the President argue that Trump is upending the orthodox order in a way that will produce results. 'He looks at the trade landscape and knows that with the established order America loses, so we lose nothing disrupting it. The china is all set, so pull the tablecloth out from under it and if a few things break, so be it,' says one senior official. 'Trump is the one who ultimately calls the shots, and I think people have to understand that.'US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.

"Alessandro Speciale and Fergal O'Brien by Frankfurt/Zurich | Protectionism is slowly starting to weigh on the global economy. From demand at factories to company profits and prices consumers are paying, the tit-for-tat trade battle US President Donald Trump started with China and the European Union is starting to show up in numbers. And it is still early days, with Mr Trump saying Tuesday (Wednesday AEST) that 'tariffs are the greatest', a warning that he may not let up until he gets what he wants. The latest signs of the fallout came in activity reports from Japan, Europe and the US, as well as anxious words from companies facing an additional uncertainty and having to decide between taking a hit to their profit margins or jacking up prices. Many manufacturers are also facing higher raw-material costs, another squeeze on earnings. Harley-Davidson on Tuesday (Wednesday AEST) cut its profit margin forecast, citing tariffs. The iconic motorcycle maker was caught in the crossfire of the trade war last month when it announced plans to shift some U.S. production overseas, prompting attacks from Mr Trump.Dutch electronics firm Royal Philips chief executive Frans van Houten says an escalation of tariffs may mean it has to pass on costs to customers, and Whirlpool said rising raw material costs hurt results in some of its markets in the second quarter. AdvertisementFor the global economy, which was enjoying its best spell in years, there is a sense that the period of synchronised global growth is at an end. The US has got a temporary shot in the arm from tax cuts, but growth is cooling in China, a number of emerging markets are dealing with a currency sell-off, and Europe has been slow to recover from a winter-battered start to the year. Slower phase According to Abby Joseph Cohen, advisory director at Goldman Sachs, global growth will continue into 2019, but it is moving into a slower phase. A trade war on top of that would be a further weight. 'What is so hard to quantify is the impact not just on demand but on costs and on supply-chain disruption,' she said. 'What we have now are anecdotes more than anything but this is what we need to be watching. Clearly if there were an all-out trade war, it would be very difficult for investors to focus very directly just on the fundamentals, the geopolitical environment would be very uncomfortable.'In the 19-nation euro area, IHS Markit's monthly survey showed growth softened in July on weaker new orders and deteriorating confidence. Factory activity in Japan grew at the weakest pace since 2016 and, in the UK, where Brexit is another complication, manufacturing output expectations weakened, as have investment intentions. The Markit reports come just days after central bankers and finance ministers from the Group of 20 economies said that trade tensions are threatening global growth, echoing multiple warnings from around the world. In China, concern has reached such a level that authorities on Monday unveiled a package of policies to boost domestic demand to cushion the economy from the fallout from the trade dispute. The euro-area composite Purchasing Managers Index for manufacturing and services fell to 54.3 from 54.9 in June, a sharper drop than economists had forecast. A measure of expectations fell to a 20-month low.Outlook has deteriorated 'Given the waning growth of new business and further slide in business optimism, the outlook has also deteriorated,' said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at Markit. For manufacturers, the survey saw trade worries 'intensify markedly', he said. The pressure on the economy may only be beginning, and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is in to Washington this week in an effort to ease tensions. He will not come unarmed. The EU has vowed to retaliate against any import duties, and China has also said it will match American sanctions on its exports. In the US, the PMI report showed continued growth in private-sector activity, but a second straight drop in goods export orders. There was also a record surge in prices charged and more supply-chain delays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"* Soybeans under pressure as U.S. exports take a hit * Wheat falls 0.9 pct, gives up last session's gains * Corn down after four sessions of gains on strong demand (Adds details, quotes) By Naveen Thukral SINGAPORE, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Chicago soybean futures lost more ground on Tuesday as U.S. exports take a hit amid an intensifying trade war with the world's biggest importer China. Wheat slid 0.9 percent, while corn eased following four sessions of rally which was spared by strong demand and rains delaying harvest in parts of the U.S. Midwest. The Chicago Board of Trade most-active soybean contract was down 0.1 percent at $8.40-1/2 a bushel, by 0226 GMT, near the session low of $8.37-1/4 a bushel - the weakest since Sept. 20. Wheat slipped 0.9 percent to $5.22-1/2 a bushel, having closed 0.6 percent firmer on Monday; and corn lost 0.5 percent to $3.58-3/4 a bushel. 'The trade war between the United States and China is escalating, which is causing worries that it will have a longer term impact on U.S. soybean exports,' said Phin Ziebell, an agribusiness economist, National Australia Bank. 'U.S. exporters will have a tough time selling that record crop which is currently being harvested.' The USDA said harvesting of U.S. soybeans was 14 percent complete, slightly ahead of market. Soybean under pressure as China - which buys 60 percent of the oilseed traded worldwide - and the United States imposed fresh tariffs on each other's goods on Monday as part of an escalating trade war. China decided not to send Vice Premier Liu He to Washington this week, The Wall Street Journal reported last week. The United States does not yet have a scheduled date to announce another round of talks, a senior White House official said. Dalian soymeal futures rose 2.5 percent on Tuesday to 3,266 yuan ($475.90) a tonne, their biggest daily gain in three months, after Beijing and Washington implemented further tariffs. Corn was 16 percent harvested, as of Sunday, in line with analysts' expectations, the USDA said.

"LONDON, June 19 (Reuters) - The Aussie dollar takes a thumping, soybean prices swing, and German carmaker shares are stuck in reverse.Financial markets have been roiled by fears of an all-out trade war between the United States and China, prompting investors to dump assets at risk from rising tariffs and seek safety in havens such as Japanâ€™s yen and U.S. treasury bonds.U.S. President Donald Trump promised this week to slap tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, drawing swift threats of retaliation from China.Below are some of the currencies, stocks, and commodities seen as most vulnerable to an escalating trade conflict:COMMODITIESChina buys about a third of its soybeans from the United States, so Beijingâ€™s move to slap 25% duties on U.S. soybean imports has made the commodity a key battlefield.It will raise the cost of soymeal, which is used in China to feed pigs and poultry. Chinaâ€™s most active soymeal futures rose 4.2% on Tuesday.Soybean prices tend to be affected more by weather than economic factors, but tit-for-tat tariffs might shift trade flows. U.S. CBOT soy futures have tumbled to multiyear lows as U.S. suppliers may now lose a chunk of Chinaâ€™s market to Latin American rivals.Finally, prices for copper, a metal widely used in the construction and power industries, have fallen to their lowest since May 31. Copper prices can be expected to tumble further if world growth slides.CURRENCIESCountries with open economies reliant on global trade are most at risk when disputes over international commerce hit.The Australian dollar ticks those boxes. Australia counts China as its biggest trading partner and its currency is heavily correlated to global growth. Many investors see the currency, known as the Aussie, as a better global trade bellwether than the Canadian dollar, which has been buffeted by negotiations over NAFTA, the North American trade pact.This week, the Aussie fell to its lowest level in 13 months, and the positioning of options signal more weakness ahead.Another candidate is Swedenâ€™s crown, given the Nordic nationâ€™s open economy and big exporting industries. The currency has weakened about 2.5% in the last three days to a six-week low against the euro.â€œCurrencies that are heavily exposed to global growth are going to feel the pressure from any escalation in the trade dispute,â€? said James Binny, global head of currency at State Street Global Advisors based in London.Asian currencies such as the Korean won as well as the Singapore and Hong Kong dollars have also weakened this week for similar reasons.EQUITIESBank of America Merrill Lynchâ€™s European fund manager survey in June found a record drop in allocations to auto stocks, indicating that investors are jittery about the sector due to Trumpâ€™s threat of imposing U.S. tariffs on German carmakers.European automakers send around $50 billion worth of cars to the United States each year. BMW is the most exposed with up to one fifth of its global sales heading to the U.S. market.Retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. cars would also hurt European firms as many export to China from their U.S. plants.As a result, shares in Volkswagen, BMW, and Daimler have fallen sharply, taking Europeâ€™s autos index to a seven-month low.The aircraft industry, including Boeing and Airbus, is another barometer as it relies heavily on an open global supply chain.Boeing is the single largest U.S. exporter to China, and its shares, along with those of its European counterpart, have fluctuated as trade tensions have risen.Steel and aluminum are regular targets in international trade disputes. U.S. tariffs on imported steel have hit shares in European steelmaking exporters such as Thyssenkrupp, Salzgitter, and Voestalpine.Europe-based manufacturers that import steel for U.S. factories may also become entangled in the conflict.There could be some winners, if European manufacturers such as ABB and Siemens win market share in China at the expense of U.S. rivals such as Honeywell.But higher trade barriers are likely to hurt most economies, leaving even the winners with a smaller market to work with.(Reporting by Saikat Chatterjee, Helen Reid, Danilo Masoni, Pratima Desai, Nigel Hunt and Tommy Wilkes; Graphic by Ritvik Carvalho Editing by Sujata Rao and Edmund Blair)Â© Copyright Thomson Reuters 2018.

"KANE COUNTY, Ill. (Reuters) - Lucas Strom, who runs a century-old family farm in rural Illinois, canceled an order to buy a new $71,000 grain storage bin last month â€“ after the seller raised the price 5% in a day.The reason: Steel prices jumped right after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs.Throughout U.S. farm country, where Trump has enjoyed strong support, tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are boosting costs for equipment and infrastructure and causing some farmers and agricultural firms to scrap purchases and expansion plans, according to Reutersâ€™ interviews with farmers, manufacturers, construction firms, and food shippers.The impact of rising steel prices on agriculture illustrates the unintended and unpredictable consequences of aggressive protectionism in a global economy. And the blow comes as farmers fear a more direct hit from retaliatory tariffs threatened by China on crops such as sorghum and soybeans, the most valuable U.S. agricultural export.A&P Grain Systems in Maple Park, Illinois â€“ the seller of the storage bin Strom wanted to buy with a neighboring farmer â€“ raised its price two days after Trump announced aluminum and steel tariffs on March 1 to protect U.S. producers of the metals. Strom and his neighbor backed out.â€œWould that price destroy us? No,â€? Strom said. â€œBut these days, you have to be smart about your expenses.â€?The metals tariffs also hitting makers and sellers of farm equipment, from smaller firms like A&P Grain to global giants such as Deere & Co (DE.N) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N). Such firms are struggling with whether and how to pass along their higher raw materials costs to farmers who are already reeling from low commodity prices amid a global grains glut.The worldâ€™s two largest economies have threatened each other with tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of goods recent weeks.Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum in a move mainly aimed at curbing imports from China. He has since temporarily excluded the European Union and six other allies from the duties and given them until May 1 to negotiate permanent exemptions.A&P Grain President Dave Altepeter said the steel used in their bins is made in the U.S., but domestic steel prices also have soared because of the tariffs.U.S. steel mills typically adjust their prices once a year, normally in the first quarter, Altepeter said. But this year, those prices have jumped four times, he said.The price of steel used in A&Pâ€™s grain bins has jumped about 20% since January 1.â€œAnytime thereâ€™s any type of negative talk that affects the steel mill, theyâ€™ve raised the price,â€? said Altepeter.Last year, about 95,000 tons of steel was shipped to the agriculture industry, compared with the 14 million tons for the U.S. auto industry, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry group.Other factors had been driving up steel prices before the recent trade disputes, including an improving global economy and accelerating manufacturing and construction, particularly in the U.S.The White House referred questions from Reuters to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which did not respond to a request for comment. Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue have vowed the U.S. government will protect farmers from Chinaâ€™s tariffs, but not explained how.U.S. farmers can ill-afford any loss of sales. Farm income has dropped by more than half since 2013, following years of massive harvests that have depressed prices for staples such as corn and soybeans.U.S. competitors Brazil, Argentina, and Russia have all raised grain output in recent years, eating into the U.S. share of global markets. Mexico imported 10 times more corn from Brazil last year and is set to buy even more in 2018 on worries that renegotiations of the NAFTA trade pact could disrupt their U.S. supplies.Strom said he has also pushed back plans to build a new metal storage building to house his planter and the combine head he uses for harvesting corn and soybeans. Other farmers, food producers, and beer makers have scrambled to finalize deals for steel-based equipment before prices climb more.CONSTRUCTION POSTPONEDIn Riverton, Illinois, farmer Allen Entwistle said he postponed construction of a new $800,000 storage system for grain after AGCO Corpâ€™s (AGCO.N) GSI unit increased prices by 15%.Entwistle, who voted for Trump, will instead store corn in bags on the ground.â€œPresident Trump keeps telling us heâ€™s going to get a better deal,â€? Entwistle said. â€œWhen are we gonna make it better?â€?AGCO said Trumpâ€™s tariffs will raise its costs and make price hikes to customers unavoidable.â€œAs the entire grain storage industry has weathered increased steel prices, AGCO and GSI are constantly looking for new ways to maximize efficiency and minimize the impact to customers,â€? said spokeswoman Kelli Cook.Other companies, including Deere and Caterpillar, are also facing pain from rising steel prices, which account for about 10% of equipment manufacturersâ€™ direct costs.Deere CEO Samuel Allen told Reuters last month the company will have to absorb the price increase and cut costs elsewhere. Chinaâ€™s threatened tariffs on U.S. crops could hurt the company even more by undermining demand from farmers, he said.â€œThis has a huge effect on livelihood of the farmer right now, and at the same time it has a huge impact on manufacturers,â€? said Dennis Slater, president at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, an industry group.U.S. net farm income is forecast to drop to $59.5 billion in 2018 dollars, down from $64.9 billion in 2017, an 8.3% decline, according to the USDA.TARIFF â€˜DOOM-AND-GLOOMâ€™In Sheffield, Iowa, Sukup Manufacturing has seen steel prices soar 40% since November, said Brent Hansen, the companyâ€™s commercial accounts manager.The maker of grain bins and premanufactured steel buildings has encouraged customers to buy quickly before prices jump more. But some have already postponed projects, Hansen said.â€œThatâ€™s obviously a big price increase for an industry thatâ€™s a little bit doom-and-gloom over tariffs,â€? Hansen said.Sukup used to give customers up to two months to consider its bids for projects. Now, it allows just a week in some cases because of volatile steel prices, Hansen said.Prices have jumped by 25% for thermal insulated panels that keep food cold â€“ which can use either steel, aluminum, or both, said Glenn Todd, owner of Todd Construction Services. The company has built food processing and storage facilities for Bumble Bee Seafoods and poultry company Foster Farms.Richard Adkins, director of sales at Discovery Designs Refrigeration in Mukwonago, Wisconsin, thought his company wouldnâ€™t have to worry about Trumpâ€™s tariffs. Most of the metal they use to design industrial refrigeration systems comes from Canada and Mexico, he said, and the president has exempted both countries from the levies.It didnâ€™t matter. Price-hike notices from vendors landed in Adkinsâ€™ mailbox days after Trump announced the duties.â€œThereâ€™s this knee-jerk reaction,â€? Adkins said. â€œWeâ€™re quoting prices for projects that wonâ€™t be awarded for another six or eight months, and no one wants to be hung out to dry.â€?Reporting by Tom Polansek in Chicago and PJ Huffstutter in Kane County.

"One in seven farmers who voted for President Trump in 2016 would not vote for him today, according to a poll released on Monday. The escalating trade war was the leading cause of erosion for Trump among a staunchly Republican group. But a majority still back him: 60% would vote for him now vs. 75% in 2016.Support for Trump in farm country generally mirrors party affiliation, according to Farm Futures, which polled 924 farmers from July 20 through August 2. Three fourths of farmers identify themselves as Republicans and 10% say they are Democrats. Thatâ€™s roughly the same as the 75-11 split in the farm vote between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The remaining 14% voted for third-party candidates or did not vote in 2016.Now, 60% say they would vote for Trump and 24% would not when asked, â€œIf the presidential election was held today, would you vote for President Trump?â€? The rest were undecided.The decline in support for Trump appeared to be concentrated among Republicans. No one who backed Clinton in 2016 would switch sides today, according to the poll.â€œTrade seems to be the sticking point for the presidentâ€™s wavering supporters, because most farmers give Trump high marks in other areas,â€? said Farm Futures. Growers overwhelmingly support the president on regulatory relief and immigration, but two thirds agreed with the statement, â€œPresident Trump has not done enough to support the biofuels industry.â€?Trump ran on a platform of tax cuts, regulatory relief, and support for corn ethanol, a heady mixture in rural areas. He rolled up landslide margins in rural America, key to his election, despite Farm Belt concern about his promises to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and NAFTA. Farm groups and ethanol makers repeatedly fought EPA since Trump took office over proposals to weaken the Renewable Fuel Standard.Large majorities of farmers said they were willing to give Trump more time to work out trade deals. They believe that tariffs may hurt in the short term â€œbut my farm will be better off under President Trump in the long run.â€? At the same time, 40% said Trumpâ€™s actions on trade have permanently damaged agriculture.Exports generate 20% of farm income, so farmers pay attention to trade disruptions. Since the late 1970s, exports have been regarded as a path for farm prosperity. Economist Dave Widmar said farm income could fall to â€œlevels last observed during the farm financial crisis of the 1980sâ€? without the agricultural aid of up to $12 billion proposed by the administration. â€œNet farm income slipping below $50 billion would have sent major concerns throughout the farm economy,â€? wrote Widmar at the Agricultural Economic Insights blog.â€œBeyond 2018, one has to wonder what happens if trade relations donâ€™t improve,â€? said Widmar. â€œLower income would likely trigger additional adjustments in farm capital purchases, cash rental rates, and farmland values.â€?The Trump tariffs are adding to Republican heartburn in the Heartland and are one of the reasons Democrats are likely to win control of the House in the midterm elections, a political analyst told the International Sugar Symposium, according to The Hagstrom Report. If commodity prices remain subdued, voters will be less forgiving of Republican incumbents, said David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"By: AJOT | Jul 09 2018 at 08:04 AM | International TradeA trade conflict between the US and China will alter the shape of commercial activity across Asia, harming some companies, but perhaps presenting opportunities to others. Here is a provisional assessment of how to stay on top in a rapidly changing environment.The Trade WarSetting aside â€œTrumpismsâ€?, US patience towards Chinaâ€™s mercantilism â€“ exemplified by the provision of cheap credit and subsidies to exporters, the systematic appropriation of intellectual property, and a failure to open its economy â€“ has run short.Now, Washington has started to impose tariffs on China (and other trading partners) on a staggered basis. The tariffs include a 25% levy on steel, a 10% tax on aluminium, and a 25% charge on Chinese goods worth about USD34 billion, and with tariffs on goods valued at USD200 billion or more in prospect.The Chinese government has responded with its own tariffs on American fruit, pork, soy beans, sorghum, aluminium, and steel pipes. Further escalation seems inevitable, as tensions intensify.Investments are also at risk. Washington plans to curtail Chinese investment in high technology companies, while General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (â€œCCPâ€?) Xi Jinping has threatened to â€œpunch backâ€?.Winds of ChangeAny trade war will prompt striking changes across Asia. From a strategic standpoint, commercial ties between the US and China have hitherto stabilised a competitive relationship. Without such restraints, ties will fray.The prevailing concern, though, is economic. Tariffs will dampen economic activity, by raising uncertainty and by pushing up prices, so eroding demand. Moreover, President Trumpâ€™s hostility towards the global trading regime, exemplified by his reported disdain for the World Trade Organisation, posits the prospect of severe damage to the existing trading order.In particular, a focus on bringing production back to the US will loosen or restructure international supply chains that have contributed much wealth to Asia, with consequences to business across the region.Sectors Most at RiskA truism is that no one benefits from a trade war. Yet, some sectors and businesses will do better, or worse, than others.The Gaming sector in Macau is highly exposed. Any significant slowdown or fall in the yuanâ€™s value may lead to Beijingâ€™s further curbing of capital outflows, so dampening casino revenues. Moreover, three of Macauâ€™s six gaming concessionaires are US companies, Las Vegas Sands (â€œLVSâ€?), MGM, and Wynn Resorts; and LVS founder Sheldon Adelson boasts close ties to US President Trump. These companies now sit on a geopolitical fault line. Their Macau concessions can therefore be on the line.The regional Electronics sector is also at risk, posing producers such as Taiwanâ€™s Foxconn with major challenges. Trade diversion could benefit Japanese or Korean companies with factories in Thailand or Vietnam, though.The Technology sector is another potential target. Indeed, the value of Chinese acquisitions of US technology companies had already fallen, from USD15 billion in 2015 to USD13 billion in 2017, and will slip further. The loss of prospective partnerships could now pose challenges for businesses in the robotics, information technology, communications, and aerospace sectors in Asia, such as Huawei or Alibaba.Consumer goods businesses operating in China may face boycotts, akin to those waged against the Philippines and South Korea. That said, targeting foreign businesses will prove hard, as many such businesses operate in joint ventures with Chinese partners. Even so, national champions will benefit by wrapping themselves in the flag.Foreign companies selling Services such as education and tourism in China are another potential target; the US ran a surplus of USD38 billion in trade in services in 2017. That may be why the Chinese government in July warned its citizens of US gun crime; and Chinese students may come to prefer or be encouraged to select Australia, Canada or Europe over the US for study. The legal sector, particularly the part focused on trade rules, may also benefit.Agriculture is also in play. Beijingâ€™s decision to charge levies on US soybeans and sorghum will boost suppliers in Brazil and Canada. Thai cassava production may also rise in response to Chinese demand for ethanol inputs.Trade shifts could also affect the Shipping industry, which has struggled to recover from the 2008 downturn. Now, the industryâ€™s focus could depart from US-China trade, perhaps bolstering companies operating regional or domestic routes instead.Finance also faces notable risks. A trade conflict will strain Chinaâ€™s economic model, given high debt levels, bond defaults, and tightening money supply. The Chinese government will shore up stability, but the risk of financial denouement is real, and any contagion could harm the frailer South East Asian economies. Even so, companies could respond by buying specialist financial instruments or insurance, boosting some businesses.What can be done to mitigate risk?For now, much is unclear. Key issues include how deep the trade conflict goes, and for how long it runs. The more intense a conflict, though, the more substantial the changes, whether in terms of trade diversion, the loosening of Asian supply chains, or of growing financial risk.Companies can take steps to protect and even further their interests, though:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"True to his word, the United States President Donald Trump fired the opening shots of a likely trade war. His primary target is none other than China, the world's leading trading nation, which is well on its way to becoming the world's biggest economy in coming years.In late March, the American president targeted imports from China, which have dramatically expanded in recent years. Up to $60bn in Chinese exports now hang in the balance, as the US ramps up tariffs against major trading partners.Trump is also considering additional restrictions on Chinese investments in America. A Chinese bid to buy an American semiconductor equipment company was blocked by regulators earlier this year.The US intelligence community has encouraged a ban on imports of the Chinese phone brand Huawei, a likely prelude to more comprehensive pushback against any Chinese investments in critical sectors of the economy.China responded in kind, targeting as many as 128 American products, mostly in the realm of food and agriculture. The Asian powerhouse imposed an additional 25 percent tariff on recycled aluminium and pork from America, while wine, nuts, fruits and seamless steel tubes were hammered by an additional 15 percent tariff rates.{articleGUID}The escalating tit-for-tat between the two superpowers has sent shockwaves across international markets, raising concerns over a potential lose-lose outcome for the global economy. There was almost universal condemnation of the US government's latest protectionist policy. Unless Trump strikes a compromise with Beijing in the near future, he risks hurting the very people who voted him into power the most.Warning shotsAt the heart of Trump's latest offensive are Chinese steel and aluminium exports as well as alleged intellectual property theft. The US government contends that Beijing has engaged in unfair trade practices, which have driven countless Americans into unemployment across rustbelt states.The firebrand US president imposed the latest round of trade sanctions by invoking Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. While perfectly legal at home, the US's unilateral exercise of trade sanctions has severely undercut its decades-long role as the harbinger of global free trade.Trump's hardball strategy could provoke a rising and proud China, unleashing a beggar-thy-neighbour dynamic between the world's two leading economies.In the run-up to the decision, even key US allies in Europe, Asia and Latin America threatened collective response against Trump's latest offensive.World Trade Organization (WTO) Director General Roberto Azevedo warned about a 'catastrophe' and the likely 'severe' effect of the simmering trade war initiated by America. He expressed his organisation's commitment to 'to avoid the war' between US and China from degenerating into a global depression.Eager to prevent a full-fledged diplomatic meltdown, the American government, citing national security considerations, exempted most of its key partners from the latest round of sanctions, particularly on aluminium and steel imports.Argentina, Australia, Canada, Brazil, the European Union, South Korea, and Mexico were given temporary or full exemption. But Japan, Turkey, Russia and China are expected get hit the hardest by the dramatic rise in tariffs.Fire and furyIn effect, Trump managed to alienate two key allies, Japan and Turkey, while escalating tensions with key rivals, Russia and China. Yet, with more than half of steel imports exempted, the economic wisdom of Trump's latest sanctions is under question. An incensed China warned America to 'rein in its horse before the edge of the cliff,' otherwise it 'will fight to the end'.{articleGUID}China has gone so far as threatening to reduce its purchase of US treasury bonds, a key source of liquidity for the American market; cancelling major trade deals like purchase of American Boeing aircrafts; cracking down on American car and electronics investors; and maintaining long-term blockage of tech companies from Silicon Valley from China's humongous internet market.Yet, the US government seems intent on upping the ante. In its National Security Strategy (NSS), the Trump administration promised to leverage the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and its majority-support in the Congress to 'ensure it addresses current and future national security risks'.In particular, it is committed to defending the so-called National Security and Innovation Base (NSIB), the network of capabilities, people, and knowledge, which undergird American technological supremacy.Thus, the US government is even reviewing 'visa procedures to reduce economic theft by non-traditional intelligence collectors', targeting foreign students from 'designated countries' in order to ascertain 'intellectual property is not transferred to our competitors'.This means, unless China overhauls its intellectual property infrastructure, more trade sanctions and restrictions are on the horizon. Trump's 'art of the deal' strategy is likely aimed at forcing Beijing into concessions, including removal of restrictions on American entry into the car, electronics and financial markets in China.{articleGUID}Yet, his hardball strategy could provoke a rising and proud China, unleashing a beggar-thy-neighbour dynamic between the world's two leading economies. In a bid to stave off further tensions, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has promised to ease access for American investments; strengthen intellectual property restrictions; and scale down its demand for technology transfer from foreign companies.It remains to be seen whether this would satisfy his American counterparts, but both powers know that they're trapped in a state of mutually assured financial destruction. As Nobel Prize-winning economist Christopher Pissarides correctly warns, a tit-for-tat trade war could 'actually hurt' Trump's basic constituency of manufacturing and agricultural workers, who depend on foreign investment from and trade with countries such as China and Japan.Ultimately, any kind of great power protectionism could undermine a thick network of trade agreements, which undergird peaceful commerce among nations around the world. What is at stake is no less than an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity in human history.The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Why Trump's Trade War Will Impact the Marijuana Industry TooVapingPhoto Credit: Wikimedia CommonsThe Trump administration has included vaping devices and their components among the Chinese products subject to punitive tariffs, and that's going to have an impact on the marijuana industry. But it's not just vaping devices: Many other products made in China, from fixtures to packaging materials and more that are used in the pot industry, are also subject to increased tariffs.The bottom line will be increased costs for legal marijuana companies and increased prices for their customers. To the degree that tariffs subdue growth in legal marijuana markets, they could also end up putting a hit on marijuana tax revenues for states and localities.Companies selling vaping products are on the front line, said Arnaud Dumas de Rauly, co-CEO of the Blinc Group, which develops and sells technology and products related to vaping and runs an incubator program to research, develop, and brand technologies for marijuana and nicotine vaping. Dumas de Rauly made his comments in July 24 testimony at public hearings on the tariffs held by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.The vast majority of vaping devices, as well as batteries, filters, and cartridges, are manufactured in China, Dumas de Rauly noted, and there are currently few alternatives for producing them. But the profit margin on such devices is only 10 to 15 percent, and that means companies will either have to find alternative sources, eat the hit to their bottom lines, or, more likely, pass the increases on to consumers.And that will have an impact on the 'entire cannabis consumption marketâ€”including medical and recreational marijuana,' Dumas de Rauly said.It's not just consumers who will feel the impact, Dumas de Rauly warned. Higher prices mean decreasing sales and shrinking tax revenues and '25 percent of sales come from cannabis vaping products,' he said.The business press, which now actually treats the marijuana business as a real industry, found plenty of people who echoed Dumas de Rauly's sentiments. In an interview with Forbes, Brooke Davies, executive director of Cannabis Organization of Retail Establishments, a non-profit trade association representing cannabis retailers in Washington State, said that tariffs were already having an impact. Small growers there, already under pressure from dropping marijuana prices, will see profit margins shrink even further because the glass jars they buy from China to package their buds are being hit by tariffs.'The Trump tariffs will undoubtedly hurt the rural parts of Washington State,' Greg James, publisher of Marijuana Venture and Sun Grower magazines, told Forbes. 'There could well be a snowball effect that results in the outdoor growing community having an even harder time selling their crop,' he said.It's not just growers or vaping companies taking a hit. 'Any items essential to the day-to-day operations of a cannabis business, from construction equipment to cell phones, will likely increase in price,â€? Kevin Hagan of the Princeton Public Affairs Group told Forbes.Meanwhile, CNBC reported that unlike other sectors targeted for tariffs, such as imported steel, aluminum, solar panels, and washing machines, whose impacts are slower to show up (how often do you buy a washing machine?), the tariffs on vaping products will have an almost immediate impact. That means consumers will quickly see price increases and adjust their behavior accordingly.But for some peopleâ€”medical marijuana patientsâ€”marijuana isn't a luxury, but a necessity.'For those who need it, they don't have a choice,' Mary Lovely, a professor of economics at Syracuse University and nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C., told CNBC.Maybe they can comfort themselves by reading Donald Trumpâ€™s tweets. As he exclaimed in a tweet the same day as the Office of U.S. Trade Representative hearings, 'Tariffs are the greatest!... All will be Great!'This article was produced by Drug Reporter, a project of the Independent Media Institute.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp today issued the following statement after the administration officially escalated its trade war with China, causing China to impose retaliatory tariffs on goods that are vital to North Dakotaâ€™s agriculture economy.â€œThe trade war and retaliatory tariffs are going into high gear at the worst possible time for North Dakota farmers,â€? Heitkamp said. â€œAs harvest is in full swing, farmers should be focused on getting their crop off the field â€“ not worrying about plummeting prices and disappearing markets.

We can hold Chinaâ€™s feet to the fire on trade while also protecting American agriculture, but the administration has chosen a scorched earth approach that treats our farmers like collateral damage.

Because of that, it makes more sense for the focus of humanity to be centered around how to best make use of the technology. China, meanwhile, has one of the most engaged communities in the world with more than two million downloads of the company's TensorFlow machine learning tools. That makes partnering with China's AI talent an important step moving forward.Background: With regard to the trade war, Yagnik only commented to say that global landscapes evolve quickly. Google's statements on that matter likely stem from both its precarious position in the region and ongoing confrontation with the US government. Aside from TensorFlow being made available within the region, most of the company's services and products are effectively banned from China due to what many refer to as the 'Great Firewall.' That harkens back to the country's government's notorious censorship and monitoring of web usage. Simultaneously, the search giant's efforts in the region and most notably its 'Project Dragonfly' are causing a stir among US politicians. Coupled with allegations of deceptive data collections and questions about consumer privacy, Project Dragonfly is a controversial variation on Google Search which not only enables censorship but aids it. Moreover, the search requires a log-in and is purported to help with tracking of users. There's no launch date on that project but it has caused serious questions to be raised about Google's role in China and its ethical values.Setting that aside, Google has managed to keep TensorFlow going in China in spite of bans on its ongoing issues. The company has found workarounds for issues that otherwise would have prevented Chinese developers from accessing the tools, for example. Elsewhere, GitHub and Reddit are common sources of information, files, and the sharing of other important aspects of developing on the platform. In China, Google has set up a WeChat channel that acts in place of those resources. Its also poured substantial resources into ensuring the tool is available in Chinese wherever possible to make using the platform easier for developers in the region. Its goals moving forward are primarily focused on health care, astronomy, and arts.Impact: Google has invested considerable time and resources in China's developer community and to ensure that its most important contributions to technology, as a whole, are available to everyone. Its decision to ignore political, geographical, and cultural divisions, meanwhile, could be viewed as an appropriate stance to take for a global organization or as reckless. Regardless, the company does appear to be making headway in a region where it has historically been disallowed and renewing efforts to utilize AI in pursit of better health care and the sciences on a global scale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"CLOSE The cherry industry in Washington state is worried its exports to China will be hurt by a growing trade war that escalated Monday when that country raised import duties on a $3 billion list of products. (April 3) APThe possibility of a trade war is looming over U.S. companies. (Photo: iStock/Thinkstock)The possibility of a trade war could jeopardize sales of American goods exported to China -- and the damage is sure to be widespread.With President Trump threatening tariffs on Chinese products and China reciprocating, companies ranging from aircraft maker Boeing to electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla to medical device companies and farmers could be at risk.China imported $115.6 billion of U.S. goods in 2017 and another $54.2 billion in U.S. services. But some companies and industries are far more dependent on those exports than others.China, for instance, is projected to represent 15% to 20% of Boeing aircraft deliveries over the next two decades, according to Morgan Stanley.And the potential 25% Chinese tariff on U.S.-made vehicles would ironically hurt not only Detroit automakers' exports, cut deepest against German automakers BMW and Mercedes-Benz-maker Daimler and their U.S. plants in South Carolina and Alabama respectively.German automakers export 115,300 vehicles from the U.S. to China annually, while U.S. automakers other than Tesla export only 28,819, according to Evercore ISI analysts.Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said in a note that Tesla 'would bear the brunt of any increased auto tariff' since it makes all of its cars in California. While the company does not specify regional sales figures, mainland China represented about 10% of Tesla's 2017 revenue, according to Barclays estimates.To be sure, Tesla has signaled plans to build a plant in China, which would help the company escape tariffs. But the move would require it to establish a profit-sharing arrangement in which it partners with a Chinese manufacturer.General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler each sell a small number of U.S.-made cars in China every year, limiting the impact of Chinese tariffs on new vehicles. GM does import one model from China to the U.S.: the low-volume Buick Envision crossover.Here are some key U.S. products sold to China and the annual value of those shipments, according to various U.S. agencies and the U.S.-China Business Council.More: Full list of U.S. products that China is planning to hit with tariffsMore: Stocks fall as China tariff threat hits Boeing shares as trade war fears intensifyMore: Brewing trade war looms over oil markets as tariff battle escalatesSoybeans: $14.204 billionAircraft, spacecraft and related parts: $13.2 billionAutos: $8 billionMedical devices: $6.646 billionSemiconductors and components: $6 billionNavigational and measurement instruments: $5 billionForest products: $2.544 billionOil and gas equipment: $1.5 billion (2015)Coarse grains (excluding corn): $1.023 billionFish products: $960 millionHides and skins: $949 millionPork and pork products: $715 millionCotton: $553 millionDistiller grains: $477 millionDairy products: $384 millionFeeds and fodders: $380 millionHay: $356 millionWheat: $205 millionTobacco: $172 millionNotes: Some figures are 2016 and some are 2015Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2EiHZFp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BEIJING - American cherries are tantalisingly sweet. They are so loaded with sugar and low on water that China's home-grown cherries cannot compete on taste or texture.Existing contracts for this year's harvest may make it hard for China to stop buying American cherries altogetherBut this alone may not be enough, said Zhao Xiaoyu, a Beijing fruit merchant, who believes Chinese consumers will be biting into domestic cherries and lower quality fruit from elsewhere after July 6, when China is expected to impose a 25-percent border tax on hundreds of American goods.Simmering trade tensions between the world's top two economies are set to erupt into a full-blown trade war Friday, with Washington poised to impose new tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods.Beijing has pledged to hit back dollar for dollar, placing a new tax on American goods like cherries, soybeans, autos, pork and whiskey, putting them at a disadvantage to their global rivals.Washington's list is heavy on tech goods, aiming in part to shift supply chains away from China, while Beijing has put politically sensitive US farm goods in the firing line.'For simple products it's going to be faster to shift production, but for more complex products it's going to be difficult,' said Denis Depoux, from consultancy Roland Berger, noting the quickest manufacturers will need at least a year and 'won't make the changes until they know this is real and here to stay.'Farm products would appear simpler to substitute, Depoux noted, adding it would depend on the volumes available elsewhere and may require a planting season or two.- 'A day without beans' -The Chinese saying 'Take a day without meat, but not a day without beans' speaks to the importance of soybeans in the world's number-two economy.Providing critical protein in animal feed and used in cooking oil, 1.4 billion Chinese rely on imported soybeans, primarily from the US and Brazil.Last year, China imported $14 billion of soybeans from the US, its largest imported good.No other single country grows enough to satiate China's demand, soybean traders say, with annual imports of about 95 million tonnes -- about the weight of 60 million cars -- making it hard to move completely away from the US.'As soon as the tariffs are slapped on, this will be reflected in the price of soybeans,' said Cui, a soybean trader at Scents Holdings Beijing, which has bought tens of millions worth of the beans from the US, according to figures from Panjiva, a trade data firm.'When it gets to regular people's dining room table, whether it's meat or cooking oil, there will be a price effect,' Cui said, asking for his full name not to be used.To lessen the self-inflicted shock, Beijing is searching for replacements.'There are prospects for more soybeans from South America, the so-called 'Stan' countries in central Asia and even Eastern Europe,' said Si Wei, a professor at China Agricultural University.'How much we can replace, this still needs to be looked into,' he said, adding China may also substitute rapeseed from Australia and Canada to make animal feed.At home, Beijing is ramping up production in northern provinces, providing subsidies to farmers and launching an advertising blitz, according to government edicts.'Expanding soybean production is the chief political task,' declared the agriculture commission in the city of Changchun.- 'Rotting in warehouses' -Sorghum, used in animal feed and liquor making, is another grain the US sends to China in bulk, moving 4.8 million tonnes last year, according to Chinese data.In recent years, the cheap American grain beat out exports from Australia, which had been China's primary source in 2013, according to Panjiva. Experts expect Australian growers to benefit from the trade fight.Trade tensions earlier this year gave a foretaste of what may be to come: when China slapped a new customs deposit on the US grain, several ships carrying sorghum bound for China changed course en-route.The looming trade war also has US traders and growers worried. US Senator Ron Wyden blasted commerce secretary Wilbur Ross last month, noting growers with 1.5 million boxes of cherries ready for China came to him in a panic.'They're worried those cherries are going to end up stuck at the dock or rotting in a warehouse due to China's retaliation,' Wyden said.Zhao the Beijing cherry importer said existing contracts for this year's cherry harvest would make it hard to stop buying American cherries altogether.'If we lose some money on contracts this year, there's nothing we can do about it,' said Zhao.'If it's still going on next year, we'll go straight to Turkey and Uzbekistan.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Throughout Friday's trading session, the threat of an expanded trade war with China sent stocks notably lower. But by Monday morning, the narrative eased somewhat, with the major indices recovering more than half of their losses. Nevertheless, Wall Street hedge funds still have a plan in place in the event that the narrative changes once again for the worse â€” and stays that way.What HappenedHedge funds likely have multiple 'paired trade' ideas on the table in which a bet is made against one company with huge exposure to China, CNBC's Jim Cramer said during his daily 'Mad Money' show Monday. Simultaneously, a second trade is made to complete the pair where a long position is established in a company with minimal to zero exposure to China.The logic is simple: regardless of the industry of choice, the stock with exposure to China will perform worse than the one without exposure to the country, Cramer said. One example of such a pair trades is a short position in Yum China Holdings Inc (NYSE: YUMC) and a simultaneous long position in Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE: YUM).Related Link: How The Stock Market Has Responded To Tariffs In The PastAnother pair trade consists of shorting Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT), a U.S.-based machinery maker that would likely be subject to tariffs in China should the U.S. government enact tariffs on Chinese machinery. The long part of the trade would consist of buying the domestic player United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE: URI), which merely rents machinery.Why Worry In The First Place?President Donald Trump's tough talk on trade with China has many investors concerned, and investors are right to be worried â€” but from a 'rational' point of view, the real potential economic impact is 'tiny,' OppenheimerFunds equity strategist Talley Leger said during Monday's 'Squawk Box' segment. The $150 billion in goods that are subject to new tariffs are minuscule compared to the overall size of the U.S and Chinese economies, the strategist said.Nevertheless, Leger said investors should consider selling some of their domestic equities in favor of international assets if U.S. equities rebound.What's NextCramer said investors shouldn't rush to short stocks, as this strategy is mostly reserved for large hedge funds. If Trump strikes a deal with China's government, stocks with large exposure to China like Yum China and Caterpillar would 'become what we call crowded shorts and you'd be annihilated,' he said.Related Link:How Close Are We To A Bear Market, And Can It Be Avoided?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The French and Canadians have been the fiercest in their reaction to last week's acrimonious G-7 meeting, held in Charlevoix, Quebec, which broke up amid highly public and personal recriminations between U.S. President Donald Trump and fellow summiteers over trade tariffs.But one summiteer was especially eager to keep a low profile.Of all the G-7 leaders at the bruising summit, Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May largely side-stepped the skirmishing.Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May is pictured during a portion of the G-7 summit in the Charlevoix city of La Malbaie, Quebec, Canada, June 9, 2018.May recorded her disappointment but avoided leveling personal criticism. 'We had some difficult conversations and some strong debate,' she noted in a post-summit statement. She added the mild reproof, 'It does not mean taking unilateral action against your partners.'Britain's ruling Conservatives - reassured by pro-Trump Brexiters, who bragged of their own special ideological ties to the U.S. President - had banked, privately and publicly, on pulling off a quick free trade deal with Washington. That would enable them to advertise the economic and political benefits of leaving the European Union and showcase how new opportunities for a 'global Britain' would open up.But now with the war drums of protectionism beating, and foreign leaders planning to punch back at Trump by slapping trade penalties on American goods in the coming weeks, Britain is being caught in the middle - and just as fears about Brexit are rising among ordinary Britons.With a transatlantic trade war looming, British officials concede it is coming at a very bad time for Britain.FILE - Shipping containers are stacked on a cargo ship in the dock at the ABP port in Southampton, Britain, Aug. 16, 2017.Despite the establishment in the U.S. Senate of a committee to examine the possibilities of a free-trade deal with Britain, earlier hopes of an easy or speedy agreement are looking gloomier with each passing day - and with every emerging transatlantic trade spate.'With President Trump imposing tariffs on our steel, the delusion that his administration will come to our rescue shortly can now be laid to rest,' said Vince Cable, the leader of Britain's Liberal Democrats and a former business minister. 'The notion that a raft of new deals can be done swiftly or bring overall benefit to the UK economy has now been exposed as a fantasy,' he added.May's position is likely to become even more awkward in the coming days as she is forced into choosing to close ranks with European leaders, whose support she needs to seal a favorable Brexit deal, or a U.S. leader determined to re-define the trade and security relationship with Europe, fear British officials.In an article in Britain's Daily Telegraph Monday, a former Trump advisor, Sebastian Gorka, pointedly noted that Trump is 'very loyal to those who are loyal to him and who share his goals and help him achieve them.' Gorka added darkly: The bad news? He is not a man to be crossed or tested. And he has a very long memory who fail him, or misrepresent themselves. Certain participants of last week's G-7 summit meeting have learn that already - or very soon will.' In the article, written as primer for how to handle Trump on a planned visit to Britain next month, Gorka makes no mention of a free-trade deal with the U.S.WATCH: President Trump on tradeGet Adobe Flash Player Embed share Trump: The US Has Been Taken Advantage of Embed share The code has been copied to your clipboard. width px height px The URL has been copied to your clipboard No media source currently available0:00 0:00:50 0:00The balancing act between an aggrieved Europe and a U.S. president adamant America's Western allies are 'robbing' the U.S. with predatory trade policies and under-paying for collective security may be impossible to maintain.Some Brexiters fear escalating confrontation between the U.S. and Europe may have ended their chances of maneuvering Britain into a hard clean break with EU and that the transatlantic clash is strengthening their opponents' case for Britain to secure post-Brexit membership of the EU's customs union and even to stay within the Single Market.'The Quebec G-7 is a reminder to Britain of many things: that trade is a multilateral not a bilateral issue, that the U.S. is not necessarily our reliable friend and that the great nations of Europe, of which Britain is one, share the same values and interests, ' Britain's Guardian newspaper editorialized Monday.British ministers are eager to try to defuse trade tensions. David Lidington, May's deputy, told the BBC: 'I don't think a trade war does anybody any good. Everybody loses. So I think we need to work with the U.S. and with our European partners and other powers like Japan to try to find multilateral solutions to this because I believe that ordinary families benefit from free trade.'But European diplomats say they expect the transatlantic clash triggered by Trump's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will worsen. 'We had hoped to de-escalate but the G-7 summit appears to have put paid to that,' a European diplomat told VOA.'There will now be tit-for-tat retaliatory tariffs,' he said.He noted that Germany, which has been cautious about retaliation, is now hardening its attitude, despite Trump's Tweets Sunday renewing threats to raise tariffs on imported cars 'flooding the U.S. market,' which would hurt Germany especially hard.In this photo made available by the German Federal Government, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, center, speaks with U.S. President Donald Trump, seated at right, during the G7 Leaders Summit in La Malbaie, Quebec, Canada, on June 9, 2018.Diplomats say a trade war now clearly looms.

"Washington DC [United States], July 07 (ANI): China has alleged the United States (US) of commencing 'the biggest trade war in economic history' as both the countries slapped tariffs worth billions of dollars on each other's exports.US' trade war with China officially began on Friday as the Trump administration imposed tariffs of USD 34 billion on Chinese imports, escalating a fight that could hurt companies and consumers in both the countries.Chinese goods being hit by US levies include cars, computer disk drives, pump and valve parts and LEDs.This prompted Beijing to respond with levies on US imports.'China is forced to strike back to safeguard core national interests and the interests of its people,' CNN Money quoted Chinese Commerce Ministry, as saying in a statement on Friday.It also accused the US of resorting to 'typical trade bullying.'China's retaliatory tariffs on the US goods would immediately go into effect on exports like soybeans, seafood, SUVs and crude oil.Beijing previously issued a list of American commodities, including soybean and electric cars, worth $34 billion, which it said would be subject to 25 per cent tariffs.United States President Donald Trump on Thursday said that the first wave of tariffs of USD 34 billion in goods would be swiftly followed by another penalty on Chinese goods worth USD 16 billion.The United States president went on to threaten Beijing with escalating tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods.The Trump administration has been recently slapping tariffs on other countries, claiming that the US was 'being treated unfair on trade,' raising grave concerns of a global trade war.The US had announced imposition of 25 and 10 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium respectively on three of its biggest trading partners - Canada, Mexico and the European Union on May 31.In retaliation, the EU and Canada slapped tariffs in a tit-for-tat move.Last month, the EU imposed tariffs on American goods worth USD 3 billion such as yachts, bourbon and motorcycles.

"WASHINGTON - As the trade war between the world's two largest economies nears the end of its first week, its most unsettling fact may be this: No one seems to foresee any clear path to peace.The United States insists that China abandon the brass-knuckles tactics it's used to try to supplant America's technological dominance. Yet Beijing isn't about to drop its zeal to acquire the technology it sees as crucial to its prosperity.Having run for the White House on a vow to force China to reform its trade policies, President Donald Trump won't likely yield to vague promises by Beijing to improve its behavior - or to pledges to buy more American soybeans or liquefied natural gas.'It certainly feels like we're in for a protracted fight,' said Timothy Keeler of the law firm Mayer Brown and a former chief of staff at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. 'Truthfully, I don't know what the off-ramp is.'The first shots sounded July 6: The United States slapped 25 percent taxes on $34 billion in Chinese imports. Most of them are industrial goods that the Trump administration says receive subsidies or other unfair support from Beijing. China quickly lashed back with tariffs on $34 billion in U.S. products.The two countries have targeted an additional $16 billion worth of each other's products for a second round of25 percent tariffs. On Tuesday, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative proposed 10 percent tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese imports, ranging from fish sticks to burglar alarms.All told, Trump has threatened eventually to slap tariffs on up to $550 billion in Chinese imports - more than China actually exported to the United States last year - if Beijing won't relent to U.S. pressure and continues to retaliate.At the heart of the dispute: The Trump administration's complaints that China has used predatory practices in a relentless push to grant Chinese companies an unfair advantage in the industries of the future, including robotics, electric cars and biopharmaceuticals. These tactics include the outright theft of trade secrets, government subsidies to homegrown tech firms and demands that U.S. and other foreign companies hand over technology if they want access to China's vast market.Eliminating the new tariffs will prove a lot harder than it was to raise them in the first place, said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator who is a vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. 'Both sides have too much at stake and don't want to back down.'So how does the trade war end? Analysts offer several potential scenarios:China BlinksThe Trump administration boasts that China has more to lose in a trade war. After all, Beijing sold $524 billion worth of goods and services to the United States last year and bought far less - $188 billion. So China has far fewer goods to tax than the United States does.And China's benchmark stock index - the Shanghai Composite - has dropped 15 percent this year, at least partly on fears about damage from the trade conflict with Washington.'It's a dicey time for the Chinese economy,' said Claude Barfield, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and former consultant to the U.S. Trade Representative.The Yang Ming shipping line container ship Ym Utmost is unloaded at the Port of Oakland, July 2, 2018, in Oakland, California.Beijing is trying to contain a run-up in corporate debt and manage a difficult transition away from fast but unsustainable export-driven growth based on exports and often-wasteful investment toward steadier growth built on consumer spending. The International Monetary Fund expects Chinese economic growth to decelerate to 6.6 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017.So it's possible that economic pressure could persuade Beijing to cave. Yet many analysts are skeptical. Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University, said the economic damage from U.S. tariffs is 'likely to be muted since China has enough room to forestall a growth slowdown' by increasing government spending or adopting easy-money policies that put more cash into the economy.Mary Lovely, an economist and trade expert at Syracuse University, says it's unclear how China could appease Trump, even if it wanted to. China has pledged in the past to police cyber-theft and end coerced technology transfers. So any negotiations, Lovely said, would raise more questions: Would the Trump administration accept another promise? How would any promise be verified? How long would it take to determine whether Beijing has actually reformed its ways?And China's leaders might prove reluctant to back down and risk a backlash from the public.'They have nothing to gain internally by kowtowing to President Trump, and that's exactly what it would be,' Lovely said.Trump BlinksTrump faces pressures, too. The Chinese designed their tariffs to inflict political pain in the United States. They have, for example, targeted soybeans and other farm products in a shot at Trump supporters in the American heartland. And U.S. farmers are represented by trade groups and congressional delegations who aren't shy about attacking U.S. policies that threaten farm incomes.Ryan Roberts walks through a soy bean field to check if it is ready for harvest in Minooka, Illinois, Sept. 24, 2014. Corn and soybean prices have been depressed by concerns about trade tariffs and the increased cost of farm equipment.But the president would also find it hard to back down. He's already considered one possible solution only to back away from it. In May, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced after a meeting with the Chinese that the trade war was 'on hold' and the tariffs suspended after Beijing agreed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit by buying more American energy and farm products.Yet the cease-fire quickly collapsed once critics complained that the Trump administration was letting China buy its way out of the impasse.'The president felt the sting of that and didn't like that,' Keeler said. So the administration decided to 'drive a harder bargain,' and it revived - and ramped up - its tariff threat.A Win-Win ResolutionTaiya Smith, a former Treasury official who handled negotiations with China, says it's possible a deal could be reached in which Beijing ends its predatory practices but can still keep itself competitive in advanced industries. The key, she says, is persuading China that its tech companies don't need massive assistance from the state.'Their companies are becoming very powerful,' Smith said. 'They have to be willing to compete on a level playing field. They no longer need a leg up.'But she said the U.S. would have to make concessions, too, perhaps by agreeing to let China play a bigger role in global economic policymaking.'The Chinese have to have a political win somewhere in there, too,' Smith said. 'You can't design something where we get what we want and China gets nothing. They have their own politics.'The War Drags OnScott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing and a sharp critic of Beijing's trade practices, wants to see the tariffs remain until either U.S. companies leave China or Beijing opens its market wider to American goods and investment.'They should stay on for long enough that they manifest some change,' he said. 'I don't see the tariffs coming off anytime soon.'Paul notes that China has repeatedly made empty promises to reform its practices.'We have waste cans full of promises by the Chinese government to reform its anti-competitive practices that are completely ignored,' he said. 'The tariffs are the best and only leverage that we have with China, and we would be foolish to squander them without major gains.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Via: The Week:China will not be easily cowed in a trade dispute. Chinese President Xi Jinping is now exchanging threats of tit-for-tat tariffs with President Trump, who announced Thursday heâ€™s considering raising the stakes another $100 billion. China vowed to defend itself â€œat any cost.â€?Compared to the scale of the U.S. economy, the numbers are still relatively trivial and mostly theoretical. But if things do spiral into all-out trade war, itâ€™s worth noting China has a nuclear option.Iâ€™m referring to rare earth metals.These are elements like dysprosium, neodymium, gadolinium, and ytterbium. They arenâ€™t actually rare, but they do play crucial roles in everything from smart phones to electric car motors, hard drives, wind turbines, military radar, smart bombs, laser guidance, and more. Theyâ€™re also quite difficult to mine and process.It turns out the United States is almost entirely dependent on foreign suppliers for rare earth metals. More importantly, itâ€™s almost entirely dependent on China specifically for rare earth metals that have been processed into a final and usable form.Basically, if China really wanted to mess with America, it could just clamp down on these exports. That would throw a massive wrench into Americaâ€™s supply chain for high-tech consumer products, not to mention much of our militaryâ€™s advanced weapons systems.In fact, China isnâ€™t just Americaâ€™s major supplier of rare earth metals; itâ€™s the rest of the globeâ€™s major supplier as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Even as he escalates the fight over tariffs, the president is trying to persuade Congress to go along with his decision to lighten penalties on Chinese telecommunications company ZTE Corp. That decision was questionable in its own right (because it harmed U.S. credibility in sanctions enforcement), but one possible justification is that it might have encouraged China to offer concessions on trade. The tariff fight has most likely canceled that opportunity, such as it was: No Chinese leader, least of all President Xi Jinping, could be seen to placate Trump under these circumstances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The comments highlight the uncertainties surrounding global trade ahead of July 6, when President Donald Trumpâ€™s tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods are scheduled to kick in, a move that China has vowed to retaliate against. India stands out as an attractive destination because itâ€™s the worldâ€™s fastest-growing major economy.

"Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticized the U.S.â€™s decision to brand the country as a â€œstrategic competitor,â€? dismissing the notion that it poses a threat to the worldâ€™s biggest economy.Wang told a briefing on the sidelines of Chinaâ€™s national legislative session Thursday that the designation included in recent Trump administration national security documents was â€œfundamentally wrong.â€? The foreign minister said Beijing was committed to peaceful development, and greater cooperation was needed to address issues like trade and North Korea.'Although the â€˜China Threat Theoryâ€™ has now been reprinted, itâ€™s even less persuasive because facts speak louder than words,' Wang said, citing Chinaâ€™s economic growth and contributions to world peace at the United Nations. â€œAs long as we donâ€™t look with prejudice or double standards, what we can see is not a threat but fulsome opportunities. The so-called â€˜China Threat Theoryâ€™ can be laid to rest.'Concerns about the U.S.-China rivalry have heated up as U.S. President Donald Trump and his economic advisers prepare to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, while leaving open the possibility to exempting some allies. On Wednesday, Trump hinted that his restrictions on trade could run even deeper, citing Chinaâ€™s alleged theft of intellectual property.Trade War Responseâ€œIf there is any competition between us, it has to be healthy and positive,â€? Wang said, in response to a question from Bloomberg News. â€œChina and U.S. donâ€™t have to be rivals, but can be partners in competition.â€?The U.S. is said to be considering clamping down on Chinese investment and imposing tariffs on a broad range of goods to punish Beijing over unfair intellectual-property practices as part of an ongoing U.S. investigation ordered by Trump.In his remarks, Wang issued one of Chinaâ€™s most forceful responses yet to the looming trade actions.â€œA trade war is never the right solution,â€? Wang said. â€œIn a globalized world, it is particularly unhelpful, as it will harm both the initiator and the target countries. In the event of a trade war, China will make a justified and necessary response.â€?Meanwhile, the foreign minister said efforts to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table were at a â€œcrucial momentâ€? and urged both parties to work together. South Korean envoys are preparing to brief U.S. officials in Washington on their latest talks with Kim Jong Un.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Growing tension over international trade could damage the airline industry and the world economy, global airlines and aviation executives have warned.The US government has renewed tariff threats against China and imposed duties on steel and aluminum on US allies Canada, Mexico and the EU.â€œAny measures that reduce trade and probably consequently limit passenger travel are bad news,â€? Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the International Air Transport Association, said at IATAâ€™s annual meeting in Sydney. The group represents most of the worldâ€™s main airlines.â€œWe always get concerned when you start to see tensions elevate around global trade and free trade,â€? American Airlines chief executive Doug Parker said. American has not seen any effect yet on revenues, he said.The uncertainty could curb demand for the business travel, a key driver of profits for the airline industry, said Gloria Guevara Manzo, chief executive of the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). â€œ(Business travelers) need to wait and see what happens â€” will their business be impacted, do they need to diversify, go some other places. War in trade is not good,â€? she said.Planemakers Boeing and Airbus echoed that uncertainty was bad for business and said free trade helped to drive economic growth and creating jobs. Airbus said the aviation industry existed because people could travel freely and markets were open.â€œWe are in a worldwide industry here,â€? Airbus chief commercial officer Eric Schulz told reporters. â€œWe see it in a negative way because it is putting borders and putting constraints for everybody, including our customers.â€? Tariffs would not have a material impact on Boeingâ€™s results, Randy Tinseth, the companyâ€™s marketing vice president for commercial airplanes said.â€œFor example, I think 90% of the aluminum we acquire comes domestically,â€? he said. Guevara Manzo also said the WTTC was concerned about tariffs because they meant less money to invest in infrastructure, such as ports, airports and hotels. â€œSteel for hotels is like flour for bakeries,â€? she said.The annual IATA meeting brings together about 130 CEOs. and 1,000 delegates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Associated Press reports on the widening trade gap:Exports to the United States rose to $46.7 billion, down from Augustâ€™s 13.4 percent growth, customs data showed Friday. Imports of American goods increased 9 percent to $12.6 billion, down from 11.1 percent.Chinese exports to the United States have at least temporarily defied forecasts they would weaken after being hit by punitive tariffs of up to 25 percent in a fight over American complaints about Beijingâ€™s technology policy.â€œExports continued to defy U.S. tariffs last month but imports struggled in the face of cooling domestic demand,â€? said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. â€œWe expect both to soften in the coming quarters.â€?September marked the second straight record Chinese monthly trade surplus with the United States after Augustâ€™s $31 billion.Export numbers have been buoyed by producers rushing to fill orders before American tariffs rose, but they also benefit from â€œrobust U.S. demandâ€? and a weaker Chinese currency, which makes their goods cheaper abroad, said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report.September marked the second straight record Chinese monthly trade surplus with the United States after Augustâ€™s $31 billion.Export numbers have been buoyed by producers rushing to fill orders before American tariffs rose, but they also benefit from â€œrobust U.S. demandâ€? and a weaker Chinese currency, which makes their goods cheaper abroad, said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report.The yuan has lost nearly 10 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar this year. That prompted suggestions Beijing might weaken the exchange rate to help exporters, but that might hurt Chinaâ€™s economy by encouraging an outflow of capital. The central bank has tightened controls on currency trading to head off further declines.Chinaâ€™s overall export growth accelerated, temporarily defying forecasts of a slowdown as the global economy and consumer demand cool.Exports rose 14.5 percent over a year earlier to $226.7 billion, up from Augustâ€™s 12.2 percent growth. Imports grew 14.3 percent to $195 billion, down from the previous monthâ€™s 20.9 percent rate.Exports to the 28-nation European Union, Chinaâ€™s biggest trading partner, rose 11.6 percent to $37.4 billion. The Chinese trade surplus with Europe was $12.7 billion.Chinese leaders have rejected pressure to scale back plans for state-led development of global champions in robotics and other technologies.Washington, Europe and other trading partners complain those violate Beijingâ€™s free-trade commitments and U.S. officials worry they might erode American industrial leadership. But communist leaders see their industry plans as the path to prosperity and global influence.As tensions mounted, Beijing agreed in May to narrow its trade gap with the United States by purchasing more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports. Chinese leaders scrapped that deal after Trumpâ€™s first tariff hikes hit.Communist officials have ordered companies to stop buying American soybeans â€” the biggest U.S. export to China â€” and find alternative suppliers and export markets for other goods.â€œProspects for significant progress toward de-escalation of their trade conflict are low in the short term,â€? said Kuijs.Chinese exporters of lower-value goods such as handbags and surgical gloves say U.S. orders have fallen off. But sellers of factory machinery and other more advanced exports express confidence they can keep their market share.With global growth cooling and U.S. threats of more tariff hikes, â€œthe recent resilience of exports is unlikely to be sustained,â€? said Evans-Pritchard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don Luskin, chief investment officer at Trend Macro, joined SiriusXM host Rebecca Mansour on Mondayâ€™s Breitbart News Tonight to discuss his recent Wall Street Journal op-ed , â€œChina Is Losing the Trade War with Trump.â€?â€œMy thesis is that what Trump is really after here is for China to grow up and play nice like the large nation that it is,â€? said Luskin.To accomplish that, Luskin said China would have to â€œstop its own massive tariffs, stop its theft of intellectual property, stop its requirements that foreign companies that want to do business on Chinese soil have to take on bogus Chinese partners who will steal their intellectual property â€” all that stuffâ€™s got to go.â€?LISTEN:â€œThey joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, and they havenâ€™t played by the rules since Day One,â€? he said.Luskin said he was not a fan of tariffs, but found them useful in concert with economic sanctions and other forms of pressure against China, while President Trumpâ€™s tax and regulatory policies are perking up the U.S. economy and sowing doubt in Beijing that it can win the trade war.â€œTariffs are, in fact, a kind of sales tax you impose on yourself,â€? he noted. â€œBut we can afford it right now, and my thesis is that China canâ€™t. China is actually very fragile. China is a huge debt-fueled totalitarian economy that masquerades as â€” itâ€™s got a nice-sounding fancy name â€” â€˜state capitalism.â€™â€?Luskin said the Chinese economy is filled with excess capacity, inefficiency, poor investments, and corruption.â€œThe only way they limp along, avoiding recessions, is to issue more and more debt and get less and less GDP growth out of it. Weâ€™re in a position to put some tariffs on Chinese goods â€” which yes, make Chinese merchandise a little more expensive for us, but thatâ€™s a pain we can take. Itâ€™s not a pain they can take,â€? he said.Luskin found encouraging signs that China is getting close to raising the white flag of surrender, including a 27 percent drop in the Chinese stock market at the same time the American market is hitting â€œall-time highs.â€?The Chinese currency is also declining, suffering its two worst months in history back-to-back, which he said looks more like an economic death spiral than the birth of a new global superpower. Luskin viewed the declining Chinese stock market as a vote of no confidence from investors around the world.Luskin called the â€œelite consensusâ€? about trade policy â€œnaiveâ€? and applauded President Trump for challenging it.â€œThe idea is that at all times and in all places, more trade is good â€” even predatory trade where you have, say, state-sponsored steel mills that produce steel below cost, sell it here at a lost. The typical Cato Institute view of trade is, â€˜Well, why would you object to that? Donâ€™t you like free steel?â€™ Sure you do â€” until it puts your own steel industry out of business,â€? he said.Instead, Luskin cited the wisdom of the great economists that â€œtrade is good when it is reciprocal because if itâ€™s not reciprocal, itâ€™s not trade.â€?Luskin was not impressed with some of Chinaâ€™s demonstrations of economic might, especially given the debt burden Beijing rapidly accumulated to finance them.â€œI donâ€™t think building a bunch of empty cities, and maglev trains to nowhere, and investing in so much overcapacity in their steel industry that workers just basically show up to get paid and do nothing â€“ those are not good investments,â€? he said.â€œThereâ€™s one other thing that makes China very weak that we just donâ€™t think about here in a very orderly country like the United States, and that is: we in this country are basically free,â€? he continued. â€œWeâ€™ve been brought up to control ourselves, to discipline ourselves, to honor the rule of law.â€?â€œChina is a lawless slave state. It is really no different than the Soviet Union was 50 years ago, except theyâ€™ve got fancier, prettier skyscrapers,â€? he charged.â€œWhat that means is that youâ€™ve got a political elite that is trying to control 1.4 billion prisoners. This is a prison state. If any kind of economic slippage happens at all, there arenâ€™t enough riot police in the world,â€? he predicted.â€œThatâ€™s the real risk. Itâ€™s not the debt. Itâ€™s not the tariffs. Itâ€™s that China is not a stable culture, just like the Soviet Union wasnâ€™t, just like the East-West Germany divide wasnâ€™t. When that thing blew, man, the Soviet Union blew up into 25 pieces like in two weeks. All the peasants stormed the Berlin Wall. Thatâ€™s Chinaâ€™s true risk,â€? he said.Luskin doubted the Chinese can weather the trade war simply by printing money.â€œChina couldnâ€™t really thrive if it werenâ€™t for a lot of investment from the rest of the world,â€? he pointed out. â€œItâ€™s the investment of capital, the investment of ideas, the investment of managers that you send over there to show them how to run factories and businesses.â€?â€œWhen a currency starts weakening like this, what happens has happened over and over throughout the decades with all the emerging markets,â€? he said. â€œItâ€™s happened throughout Asia, itâ€™s happened in Latin America. Itâ€™s sort of like the 17-year locust â€” it just seems to happen on a cyclical basis.â€?â€œPeople put money into these countries, they try to devalue their currency in order to win a trade war, get a little bit of a competitive advantage,â€? he explained. â€œItâ€™s like putting your merchandise on sale. As soon as you devalue your currency, all the people who invested in your country â€” who started with dollars or euros, you know, real money â€” they start saying, â€˜Oh, my God! Why did I invest in that crazy little country, when just at the stroke of a pen they can devalue their currency by ten percent. Iâ€™m pulling my money out!â€™ Instead of having a run on the bank, you have a run on the country.â€?â€œCapital does not like to be where itâ€™s not treated well,â€? he observed. â€œIn todayâ€™s modern world, anybody could just pick up their cell phone and just, boom, â€˜I want my billion back from China.â€™ In the last two years, China has already had a trillion dollars of capital flight. Itâ€™s only got about two and a half trillion left. Thatâ€™s a lot, but you can see zero from there.â€?Luskin was skeptical of the notion that China can replace departing foreign demand with domestic consumption.â€œThereâ€™s a factory in Shenzen thatâ€™s operated by a Taiwanese company called Foxconn,â€? he said. â€œItâ€™s a single factory thatâ€™s 1.4 square miles big, that employs 450,000 people in a single factory. They make iPads, and they make iPhones. None of them are consumed in China. Theyâ€™re all exported. Do you think the Chinese are suddenly going to start buying those? Itâ€™s just not going to happen. Theyâ€™ve already got their knockoff iPhones based on the stolen intellectual property from Apple. It ainâ€™t never gonna happen.â€?Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 9 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Pacific).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"His comments came just hours after China vowed to retaliate against US plans to levy tariffs on about $US200 billion ($277 billion) in Chinese goods. Ma said Alibaba will also be affected by the rising tensions, given its wholesale business allows American merchants to source products from China.

If the US insists on levying tariffs on Chinese goods, then China should shift its business to the rest of the world, he said. 'When problems come, learn how to hide, learn how to train,' he said. 'I believe Daniel and his team will have the wisdom to fight for the future.' Loading Ma's speech underscored the void he will be leaving when he steps down in a year's time.

Ma said he received many queries from acquaintances, including questions on whether he was experiencing a 'Minnesota' situation, a reference to current rape allegations that JD's Liu is facing. That elicited a burst of laughter from the crowd.

"As the between the US and China drags on with new tariffs and no end in sight, we need to ask ourselves: What do they want? A fundamental objective for both is to become less reliant on the other. The should thus be reframed as a conscious uncoupling.Behind the rhetoric from both sides lies a profound distrust. US suspicion stems from two specific issues. China is increasingly seen as a national security threat that fails to play by the rules. The Trump administrationâ€™s stance has spurred debate over whether it was a mistake to allow admittance of a highly protectionist Communist country to the World Trade Organization. Democrats may dislike Trumpâ€™s methods, but few will disagree with his view of China as a dangerous rival.For its part, the government of is concerned about Chinaâ€™s dependence on and finished manufactured products. The focus of its 2025 plan is to shift Chinese consumption of high-tech products away from foreign, specifically American, manufacturers and toward domestic companies.So how will they decouple? Thereâ€™s little historical precedent to consider how this might look. Two major powers have never been so closely intertwined. However, there are some patterns emerging. First, alliances are slowly evolving into more cohesive forms. Just as the new agreement (likely to include Canada) seeks to divert more trade into Nafta, other countries have started reconsidering their reliance on Chinese telecom-equipment makers for the rollout of 5G wireless networks.Second, thereâ€™s a reassessment of where key products should be made. The second batch of Trumpâ€™s tariffs focuses on low-end intermediate exports with the intention of reducing Chinaâ€™s role in the global value chain and pushing reshoring to the US and other locations, as a recent Natixis report noted.ALSO READ: Despite talks, Donald Trump pushes for tariffs on $200-billion China goodsThough itâ€™s unlikely that Apple Inc. will start making iPhones in the US, shifting factories to allies is probable and builds upon existing trends. China is no longer a low-cost producer, and both foreign and locally owned firms there are actively considering plans to relocate operations. As Samsung Electronics Co. has shown in Vietnam, it isnâ€™t necessary to make a final product in a country that manufactures the specific inputs. Chinese exports are dominated by electronics and basic machinery that rely on global supply chains, so itâ€™s certain many companies are reevaluating their long-term sourcing plans.If the is intent on shifting supply chains away from what it considers a strategic adversary, it should accelerate plans to encourage this trend. Trade agreements that grant allied countries special access to US markets with higher-quality governance and legal systems will increase the appeal for firms of moving out of China. That could mean revisiting theWashington must also actively open its domestic markets to Africa, Latin America and emerging Asian economies in lower-skilled products, where China dominates. The primary competitor for Chinese export market share isnâ€™t North Carolina but Mexico, Vietnam and South Africa. For an administration seeking to reduce its dependence on Chinese garment and textile exports, raising tariffs on Rwandan garment exports is self-defeating.The US and China have talked officially of resolution, but realistically, the red lines laid out by both sides make a negotiated settlement difficult to envision. The requires much broader market access and more changes to Chinaâ€™s socialist model than Beijing is willing to grant. The US government, with bipartisan support, is likely to pass an updated foreign investment oversight bill that targets China in all but name.If Washington really wants to reduce its dependence, it needs better planning to trade with allied countries and must allow other emerging-market economies to benefit from its tariffs on China.

We established new June quarter records for Mac sales in India, Turkey, Chile and Central and Eastern Europe, he said.iPhone too had a very strong quarter and revenue from the phone's sales was up 20% year-over-year, the company said.

"Tim Graham/Getty ImagesA trade spat between China and the United States has escalated into an outright trade war in recent months, seeing both sides introduce tit-for-tat tariffs on the others exports totalling hundreds of billion of dollars.However, based on activity signals from early October, the trade war has yet to have a meaningful impact on Chinaâ€™s industrial sector.Macquarie Bank expects similar outcomes in official Chinese economic data, something that will support assets closely aligned to the performance of the Chinese economy such as the Australian dollar and copper.Thereâ€™s little evidence that an escalating trade war with the United States is impacting Chinaâ€™s industrial sectors, according to Macquarie Bankâ€™s China Business Cycle Indicator, or MCBCI for short.â€œThe MCBCI continued to track sideways in October, with a modest dip to 50.8, well within the range that could be accounted for by statistical volatility,â€? Macquarie Bank said.â€œThis suggests that there is little evidence that the imposition of US tariffs on Chinese exports â€“ the latest escalation took effect on 24 September â€” has had a meaningful impact on Chinese industrial activity.â€?The indicator aims to estimate activity levels across Chinaâ€™s manufacturing sector from one month to the next, and is similar in construction to PMI reports.However, it is released in advance of those better known activity measures, making it somewhat of a lead indicator on what to expect.Macquarie BankBased on the latest results, Macquarie says thereâ€™s little evidence to suggest that activity levels deteriorated further in October.â€œWhile both the NBS and Caixin PMIs fell in September, we feel that the dip was probably more a reflection of deteriorating sentiment than an indication of weaker activity,â€? Macquarie says.â€œConsequently, we expect a modest rebound when the PMIs for October are published at the end of the month.â€?Following the staggered introduction of tiered tariffs on Chinese goods entering the United States in recent months, Macquarie says it is now on alert for signs that recent fiscal and monetary stimulus measures introduced by Chinese policymakers are feeding through activity levels in the economy.â€œWhile it will take some time for these measures to gain traction, it is likely that they will be enough to offset the impact of the tariffs in the short term, with a risk that China surprises to the upside,â€? Macquarie says.â€œThe next key data point will be Chinese credit, which should show a modest rebound in local government bond issuance, which will in turn be a sign that infrastructure spending is beginning to rebound.â€?Updated monetary growth figures for September from the Chinese government could arrive at any point this week, possibly on Friday when Q3 GDP data is released.Given so much bad news has been priced into financial assets closely tied to the performance of the Chinese economy, Macquarie says any positive surprises could see recent losses reversed.â€œWe expect China proxies such as copper and the AUD to benefit from the more positive data flow,â€? it says.NOW WATCH: Money & Markets videosBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.

"(Kevin Frayer / Getty Images)Chinaâ€™s overall trade surplus missed expectations, but its surplus with the US held steady.The first round of US tariffs against China went into effect on July 6.Analysts said Chinaâ€™s ongoing surplus with the US was helped by recent weakness in the Chinese yuan.Chinaâ€™s international trade surplus fell in July, according to data from the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics.The NBS said the monthly surplus came in at $US28.05 billion, missing estimates of a $US39.05 billion surplus and down from $US41.61 billion in the previous month.However, Chinaâ€™s surplus with the US was little-changed $28.09 billion, down slightly from $US28.93 billion in June.The US implemented a 25% import tariffs on $US34 billion worth of Chinese goods on July 6.According to Reuters, analysts said the negative effects from the first round of US tariffs would have been partially negated by the recent bout of weakness in the Chinese yuan.Capital Economics said that a weaker currency would continue to support Chinaâ€™s trade balance with the US in the months ahead, although overall exports may decline due to a pending slowdown in global growth.Trade tensions between the two countries remain high, with the US rolling out tariffs on another $US16 billion worth of Chinese goods this week.In addition, US President Trump has threatened to raise the tariff rate to 25%, up from the current 10%, on a further $US200 billion worth of Chinese products.China is threatening to retaliate with tariffs of its own on $US60 billion of US exports.Chinaâ€™s trade surplus with the US was higher than its overall surplus in the month of July, which suggests it ran a net trade deficit with its other major trading partners.Total exports rose by 12.2%, offset against a 27.2% rise in imports.Over the first seven months of 2018, Chinaâ€™s total surplus with the US was $161.63 billion, up from $US142.75 billion over the same period last year.Chinese share markets remain volatile, with both major exchanges in Shenzhen and Shanghai down by more than 1% in afternoon trade.Todayâ€™s price action follows a sharp selloff on Monday, which was reversed yesterday when Chinese stocks posted their biggest one-day gain in two years.NOW WATCH: Money & Markets videosBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.

"Instagram / @turnbullmalcolmDespite escalating US-China trade tensions, analysts from UBS and CBA said Australia should be relatively insulated in the near-term.CBA said Chinaâ€™s economy was big enough to weather a trade war, and Australian exports arenâ€™t on-sold to the US.UBS said in the event of a tit-for-tat escalation, Chinese policy makers will step in to support their economy.President Trump put trade war fears firmly back on the agenda last week when the US threatened China with 10% tariffs on another $US200 billion worth of goods.Analysts at UBS think theyâ€™ll most likely be implemented, which means a tit-for-tat escalation between the two countries is still on the cards.Such a scenario would almost certainly have implications domestically for Australia. For one thing, China is the countryâ€™s biggest trading partner. And as a small, open-market economy, Australia is particularly sensitive to trends in global trade.So what would an all-out trade war mean for Australia? Based on the analysis so far from local market experts, the answer is â€” not much (for now).The Commonwealth Bank said Australia is relatively insulated when it comes to the ramifications of a trade war.â€œOur long held view is even if the US applies tariffs on all of its goods imports from China, the economic impact on China, the US and Australia will be very small,â€? CBA currency strategist Joseph Capurso said.He said Chinaâ€™s economy is too big for US tariffs to have much of an effect. And Australia is further insulated by the fact that most domestic exports to China arenâ€™t used as inputs to be on-sold to the US.Source: CBAFor example, Australiaâ€™s biggest export to China â€” iron ore â€” stays in China to be used in construction.CBA chief economist Michael Blythe highlighted the key numbers in a research note today:China takes about 30% of all Australian exports, equivalent to 5.6% of GDP; of that, 77% is consumed in China and the remaining 23% is reexported in some fashion (with 20% of those exports going to the US); so 1.4% of Australiaâ€™s trade, or 0.08% of Australiaâ€™s GDP, is exposed in a US-China trade war.â€œThe economies that will be hardest hit from the US-China trade frictions are the small East Asian economies such as Korea and Taiwan because they are integrated into Chinaâ€™s export supply chain,â€? Capurso said.UBS economist George Tharenou also noted that commodity prices have stayed relatively resilient so far, particularly bulk commodities (such as iron ore) and LNG â€” two of Australiaâ€™s biggest exports.And he said in the near-term, negative effects from a trade-related slowdown could be somewhat offset by a fall in the Australian dollar, given its position in markets as a risk-proxy for global growth.In addition, Tharenou said that rather than hit back at the US, Chinese policy makers will probably respond to further tariffs by focusing on the domestic economy.China only imports around $US150 billion worth of goods from the US, so it wonâ€™t be able to respond proportionately to the $US200 billion tariff threat anyway.UBS expects Chinese authorities to increase liquidity for banks, and ease restrictions on excessive leverage to maintain appropriate levels of credit growth and infrastructure investment.Blythe said he expected Australiaâ€™s economic growth to maintain a rate of round 3% over the next 12 months.â€œCommodity prices are at risk in a trade war that slows global growth, especially one involving our major Asian trading partners. But the AUD would be expected to play its usual buffering role in a major trade event,â€? Blythe said.Tharenou based his forecast on the bankâ€™s current base case of a continued escalation in US-China tensions, rather than an all-out trade war.â€œOverall, we expect little impact on Australia from the current trade escalation scenario and so maintain our long held GDP forecast of 2.8% for 2018 & 2019,â€? Tharenou said.Factoring in the effect from US tariffs and the domestic response from Chinese policy makers, Tharenou forecast China GDP to slow slightly in 2018/19, down to a range of 6.2-6.5% from previous guidance of 6.4-6.6%.NOW WATCH: Money & Markets videosBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.

"STR/AFP/Getty Images Lightning strike over a pagoda in Yangzhou, east Chinaâ€™s Jiangsu province.Saxo Bank warns the global economy is entering one of the most dangerous periods since the Berlin Wall fell.Rather that a market-friendly outcome, it says the risks are that trade tensions will become a full-blown trade war.Markets appear to be relaxed about what lies ahead, but itâ€™s only a problem when enough people think itâ€™s a problem.Steen Jakobsen, Chief Economist at Saxo Bank, is a man whoâ€™s never been afraid to make a bold market call.Indeed, heâ€™s renowned for it.Heâ€™s made another one in Saxo Bankâ€™s latest quarterly outlook, suggesting that trade tensions between the United States and China could end â€œvery badlyâ€?.â€œGlobal tensions are ratcheting higher by the day, fuelled by the foolish policies of foolish leaders,â€? he says.â€œTit-for-tat trade wars and agendas that pander only to self-interest are jeopardising the global economy.â€?Jakobsen says that as we approach the deadline where the US will slap 25% tariffs on $US34 billion worth of Chinese imports, the global economy is entering one of the most dangerous period since the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.â€œThe â€˜trade warâ€™, which was never supposed to happen in the first place, is now making headlines every day,â€? he says. â€œThe short-sightedness of the worldâ€™s governments is remarkable, and given the history of trade wars, profoundly alarming.â€?In his opinion, thereâ€™s three ways this trade war may play out, and none will be beneficial for the global economy.Hereâ€™s the three possible pathways he sees, along with the probability of each playing out:1. A â€˜mildâ€™ crisis where the US, China, and Europe all reach higher tariff levels but stop short of creating outright â€˜wallsâ€™ â€“ probability: 25%.2. A more severe crisis with escalating trade tensions into the November 6 US mid-term elections and beyond where President Trump must show his base that he is living up to his promises of â€˜getting the US a better dealâ€™ â€“ probability: 50%.3. A move on par with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of June 1930 â€“ probability: 25%.â€œNote that every one of these scenarios leads to weaker global growth,â€? Jakobsen says.â€œThere are no winners in a trade war, and the trend is pointing in the wrong direction as nationalist agendas erode the status of global institutional frameworks.â€?As the probabilities suggest, Jakobsen believes thereâ€™s a high likelihood that trade tensions will turn into a full-blown trade war, something that history suggests could end badly for the global economy.â€œThe worst example was the US Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930, which raised tariffs by 45% on over 20,000 imported goods,â€? he says.Global trade fell by 65% in response, contributing to the onset of the Great Depression.Jakobsen says financial markets are incredibly complacent about the possibility of a substantial escalation in trade barriers in the period ahead.â€œConsensus still holds that an outright trade war will be avoided, but this ignores the mid-term elections in the US,â€? he says.â€œItâ€™s not just about Trump, either â€” it also has a lot to do with Chinaâ€™s move to raise its global profile along every axis.â€œWaning global growth, falling credit impulses globally, and massive complacency on the risks of a trade war are our unfortunate warnings for the rest of 2018.â€?While Jakobsen is renowned for marking outlandish calls, itâ€™s pretty clear from the recent behavior of financial markets, except in China, that complacency levels are elevated despite no one really being sure as to how it will all play out.Thereâ€™s a lot of assumptions out there, but as weâ€™ve seen time and time again in markets, itâ€™s not a problem until enough people think itâ€™s a problem.And when that sentiment tide turns, things can get nasty fast.NOW WATCH: Money & Markets videosBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.

"Thomas Peter-Pool/ Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump announced that the US would withdraw from the Universal Postal Union, a 192-country treaty that helps to set international postage rates.The decision appears to be a direct shot at China.Chinese goods coming into the US are currently subject to lower postage rates, making it cheaper to ship items into America.The Trump administration argued this gives an unfair advantage to China and incentivizes importing knock-off goods from the country.The move is also the latest salvo in the US-China trade war.President Donald Trump announced that the US would pull out of an obscure 144-year-old postal treaty, in what looks to be his latest direct shot at China.The Trump administration announced Wednesday that the US would leave the the Universal Postal Union treaty, an agreement from 1874 that helps to standardize postal rules among the international community.The interesting aspect of the UPU decision is a more recent addition to the agreement. The UPU, which is now under the United Nationsâ€™ purview, sets rates that national postal services pay to ship goods internationally. Under a deal reached in 1969, developing countries can ship smaller items at lower rates than developed nations like the US. The provision is designed to help facilitate exports from smaller countries to give a boost to growing economies.But the provision also allows Chinese producers to ship items to the US at significantly low rates even compared to some US domestic shipping rates. The Trump administration says many companies even offer free shipping to the US from China because of these lower rates â€“ and as a result, roughly 60% of inbound shipping to the US comes from China.The treaty was tweaked in 2016 to adjust for some of the advantages to China after complaints from US administrations of both political parties. But the Trump administration argued that the changes were insufficient and the Chinese still received special treatment. It also said the cheaper rates incentivise the purchase of knock-off or counterfeit goods from China.Peter Navarro, Trumpâ€™s uber-protectionist and anti-China adviser, attacked the UPU as part of a Financial Times op-ed in September.â€œConsider this: it costs more to ship a package through the US Postal Service from Los Angeles to New York City than it costs to ship that same package from Beijing to New York,â€? Navarro wrote. â€œThis inequity puts American small businesses and manufacturers at a severe competitive disadvantage.â€?The decision to remove the US from the treaty represents another strike at China in the ongoing trade war, as the Trump administration attempts to force the country to make major economic changes and reduce the US trade deficit with the country.The highlights of that trade fight have been the tariffs each country has slapped on the other. Trump has imposed tariffs on just over $US250 billion worth of Chinese imports coming into the US and has threatened tariffs on another $US267 billion. China responded with tariffs on $US110 billion worth of US goods, and the government is prepared to move forward with more restrictions.The decision also mirrors the growing nature of the conflict with the Chinese. The US has undertaken a series of efforts that point to an escalation of its confrontation with Beijing, including sanctions on members of Chinaâ€™s defence ministry and allegations of election tampering.NOW WATCH: Briefing videosBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.

"Thomas Peter-Pool / Getty ImagesA trade war between the US and China has been heating up for much of this year.The trade war could continue to escalate over the next year.The most recent set of US tariffs on imported goods from China are scheduled to rise at the start of 2019, and both countries are threatening further protectionist actions.Escalation of trade tensions could negatively affect the economies of both countries.A trade war between the US and China has been heating up for much of this year, and it could could continue to escalate in the next year.President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration has levied tariffs on a total of $US250 billion of imported goods from China. That represents about half of all imports from China.The most recent round of tariffs, which came into effect on September 24, levied a 10% tax on $US200 billion of imported goods, including several consumer goods, like computers, furniture, and tires. Those tariffs are scheduled to rise to 25% in January 2019.China has retaliated by announcing tariffs on $US110 billion of US exports, and the country shows several signs of being ready to escalate in response to continuing tensions.The nascent trade war shows no sign of slowing down, and the situation could intensify in the coming months. After the recent round of tariffs, China called off planned trade talks with the US, which increases the likelihood of the taxes increasing in January.Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to levy tariffs on another $US267 billion of goods, which when added to the goods subject to existing tariffs would exceed the total value of goods imported from China in 2017.Not just tariffsTrade actions have also begun to move past tariffs. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on China for importing weapons from Russia under a law intended to punish the latter country for meddling in the 2016 election.The US is also withdrawing from the Universal Postal Union, a 144-year old treaty that helps set international postal rates, over concerns that the treaty unfairly advantages Chinese exporters.China has stated that it does not plan to make concessions to the US in the face of rising tariffs. Chinaâ€™s minister for commerce Zhong Shan said in an October statement, â€œThere is a view in the US that so long as the US keeps increasing tariffs, China will back down. They donâ€™t know the history and culture of China.â€?â€œThis unyielding nation suffered foreign bullying for many times in history, but never succumbed to it even in the most difficult conditions,â€? he continued.China also responded to the new US tariffs by cutting its own tariffs on non-US goods to help bolster its economy. Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations explained, â€œCutting tariffs makes a lot of sense. If youâ€™re worried about strengthening Chinaâ€™s position in the supply chain, if you cut tariffs â€“ especially on intermediate goods â€“ that helps the competitiveness of companyâ€™s within China and it helps keep down consumer costs at a time the tariff war is driving them up.â€?The move suggests that China is prepared for trade tensions to continue for the foreseeable future.Investors in the US and China could be scared offThe escalating trade war could threaten Chinese and other companiesâ€™ planned investments in the US. For example, in early 2017, Alibaba founder Jack Ma met with then-President-elect Trump and announced plans to promote up to 1 million jobs in the US by opening up the Chinese ecommerce giantâ€™s platform to small- and medium-sized American businesses.But in the wake of the recently announced tariffs, Ma told Chinese news outlet Xinhua that those plans would be scuttled. Ma said, â€œthe promise was made on the premise of friendly US-China partnership and rational trade relations. That premise no longer exists today, so our promise cannot be fulfilled.â€?Ongoing uncertainty about trade over the next year could also affect the decisions of American businesses and investors.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned in a CNBC interview in September that, even though newly taxed goods could eventually be replaced by substitutes, confidence could be shaken:â€œRemember, people do other things. They have other supply lines. But itâ€™s a $US20 trillion economy. So that is a negative. The real negative isnâ€™t that â€“ itâ€™s confidence, consistency. If people start reducing investment, if people start moving their supply chains around, that we have seen already moves the markets a little bit.â€?A prolonged trade war could also hurt the US stock market. One of the biggest drivers of stock price appreciation is corporate earnings growth, and companiesâ€™ bottom lines could be hit by the new taxes.Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a note to clients that an escalation of the trade war to include 25% tariffs on all imports from China â€œcould lower our 2019 S&P 500 EPS estimate by roughly 7% (from $US170 to $US159), resulting in no EPS growth next year.â€? That could have a big impact on stock prices.The escalating trade war could also hurt Chinaâ€™s economy. AJPMorgan analysis found that if tariffs end up being imposed on all goods trade between the US and China by sometime next year, Chinaâ€™s GDP growth could be reduced by 1%. The bank predicted that the economic damage would also hurt Chinaâ€™s stock market as well.NOW WATCH: Ideas videosBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.

"The Trump administration is said to be ready to raise its proposed tariffs on $US200 billion of Chinese goods.Trump has threatened 10% tariffs on those goods, but Bloomberg says he is expected to increase that to 25%.The move is thought to be a negotiating tactic aimed at gaining important concessions from the Chinese government.Beijing has reacted angrily to the reports, accusing Trump of â€œblackmailâ€? and threatening retaliation.Tariffs on $US34 billion of largely industrial goods have already been imposed on China.After a handful of quiet days in President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade war, it looks as if a further escalation may be on its way following reports that another round of tariffs on China could be announced imminently and a statement from the Chinese government saying it is readying a retaliation.According to Bloomberg, the Trump administration is considering levying tariffs of 25% on $US200 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the US, a move that would inevitably deepen tensions between the two nations. Trump so far has publicly threatened 10% tariffs on this tranche of imports.Citing three sources familiar with the plans, Bloomberg said the US would raise its threat to 25% tariffs as a means of getting the Chinese government to enter into negotiations to de-escalate the conflict, which has seen tit-for-tat tariff impositions largely on industrial goods.The increased tariff proposals could be announced in a Federal Register notice as early as Wednesday, one of Bloombergâ€™s sources said.The US has already placed 25% tariffs on about $US34 billion worth of Chinese goods, and it has just finished consulting on another set to be imposed on goods worth $US16 billion. It earlier imposed tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium from China and other countries.Goods already affected by Trumpâ€™s tariffs against China include batteries, trains, and ball bearings, but they could extend to more consumer goods if further tariffs are imposed. You can see a full list of goods subject to tariffs here.Before his latest tariff threat, Trump previously signalled a readiness to â€œgo to 500,â€? or impose tariffs on all $US505 billion of goods coming from China to the US.â€œIâ€™m not doing this for politics â€“ Iâ€™m doing this to do the right thing for our country,â€? he told CNBC during the interview in which he made that threat. â€œWe have been ripped off by China for a long time.â€?The latest reports of Trumpâ€™s willingness to increase tariffs on China were met with anger in Beijing, with a government representative accusing the US of attempting to â€œblackmailâ€? China. The government also made clear that it was willing to hit back at any additional tariffs.â€œUS pressure and blackmail wonâ€™t have an effect,â€? Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said, according to Reuters. â€œIf the United States takes further escalatory steps, China will inevitably take countermeasures and we will resolutely protect our legitimate rights.â€?Things look better for EuropeAs the Trump administration ratchets up its threats to China about rising tariffs, the worst of its conflict with the European Union over trade appears to be over, after last week Trump climbed down on imposing tariffs on European automobiles imported by the US.During a meeting in Washington, DC, last Wednesday, Trump and the European Commissionâ€™s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, agreed to the beginnings of a deal meant to lower tensions between the two parties.â€œThis was a very big day for free and fair trade,â€? Trump said in a press conference after the two met.In the meeting, the EU agreed to import more American soybeans and liquefied natural gas. The two sides committed to work to lower industrial tariffs and adjust regulations to allow US medical devices to be traded more easily in European markets.SEE ALSO:NOW WATCH: Money & Markets videosBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.

"President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade war with China is ongoing, with tariffs flying back and forth.While US tariffs currently apply to $34 billion worth of Chinese goods coming into the US, Trump has threatened to apply tariffs to every import from China.The trade war could have significant economic consequences, as China is the largest source of imports for 23 states and among the top five sources for 47.It could also have political consequences, as 15 of the 23 states that count China as their top import source voted for Trump in 2016.Thereâ€™s no clear resolution on the horizon for President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade war with China, and many states could soon start feeling the pain.The Trump administration on Tuesday announced a 25% tariff on $16 billion worth of Chinese exports to the US, adding to the $34 billion worth of Chinese goods already subject to tariffs. Trump has also begun to move forward with tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, and he has effectively threatened that every item from the country could eventually be subject to tariffs.Tariffs act as a tax on goods coming into the country, meaning goods coming into the US from China would be hit with an additional 25% duty. That makes those goods more expensive, which, in theory, would drive US companies to buy non-Chinese products.Given that Chinese goods represented just over 21% of all imports coming into the US in 2017, an escalation of the trade war could push up prices for many goods. While the disruptions are likely to be widespread, some states may face more problems than others.According to data from the US Census Bureau, China is a key source of imports for many states:For 23 states, China is the top source of imports.For 45 states, China is in the top three.China is among the top five import sources for 47 states. (North Dakota, Louisiana, and Delaware are the only exceptions.)Of the 23 states that count China as their largest source of imports, Trump won 15 in the 2016 presidential election.So far, Trumpâ€™s supporters have stood beside him amid the trade disputes. But growing concern from businesses and consumers, as well as layoffs and increased prices for goods, could start to take a toll.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"caption President Donald Trump. source Carlos Barria/ReutersPresident Donald Trump and China have been engaged in a tense trade dispute for over five months.Both sides recently increased tariff threats.Trump threatened to slap 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, while China threatened tariffs on another $60 billion worth of US goods.The two sides do not appear to be talking, which raises the chances of a drawn-out trade war.President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade dispute with China is entering its sixth month, and there are no signs it will end anytime soon.Both Trump and China continue to issue new threats of tariffs. And negotiations have been scarce, increasing the possibility of a drawn-out trade war.Ed Mills, a policy analyst at Raymond James, said in a note to clients that while the possibility of a breakthrough deal remained, it was unlikely to come without increased trade restrictions.â€œWe remain extremely concerned about the potential volatility between now and a breakthrough, especially as both sides are more inclined to elevate tension than blink,â€? Mills said.New threatsInstead of moving toward any type of resolution, both the US and China have rolled out new threats of tariffs over the past few weeks:The trade war kicked off in earnest in July when Trump imposed 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports to the US, prompting China to respond in kind.Trump then threatened to slap 10% tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, again leading to a counterthreat from Beijing.The action intensified Thursday, when US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announced that Trump instructed the USTRâ€™s office to examine the possibility of raising the tariff rate on the $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25%.China then retaliated with a threat on Friday to hit $60 billion worth of US exports to China with tariffs ranging from 5% to 25%. If China follows through on the threat, nearly 90% of all US goods heading to China will be subject to tariffs.The two sides have also been digging in publicly. Larry Kudlow, the presidentâ€™s chief economic adviser, told Bloomberg TV that Trump was not afraid of dragging out the fight with China.â€œTheir economyâ€™s weak, their currency is weak, people are leaving the country,â€? Kudlow said. â€œDonâ€™t underestimate President Trumpâ€™s determination to follow through.â€?At the same time, China has expressed a willingness to go to the mat over tariffs. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said Friday that if the US continued to â€œblackmailâ€? China, the conflict would only intensify.No talksKudlow, a former Wall Street economist and CNBC host, told Marketplaceâ€™s Kai Ryssdal that talks with the Chinese had stalled out.â€œVirtually nothing has happened in a trade dialogue with China in a month or six weeks,â€? Kudlow said. â€œWe havenâ€™t heard from them.â€?Kudlow also told reporters on Friday that the administration held a call with China within the past few days involving high-level officials. But multiple reports indicate that prior to the call, there has been almost no dialogue for the past month.The lack of negotiations is compounded by the fact that Trump and the White House have not articulated clear goals for the trade fight with China.Mills said all signs suggested the trade fight would stick around for the foreseeable future.â€œRegardless of a potential breakthrough, we believe that this Chinese trade fight will last well beyond the midterm elections as the reforms sought by the Trump administration will be difficult for China to accept and implement.â€? Mills said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trump is reportedly set to involve Japan in his trade war, saying he will make the worldâ€™s third-largest economy â€œpay.â€?According to a report from the Wall Street Journal late on Thursday, Trump indicated to reporter James Freeman that he is ready and willing to hit Japan with tariffs.Japan imported over $40 billion of cars into the US last year.The report comes as the US prepares to impose fresh tariffs on up to $200 billion of Chinese goods.US President Donald Trump may not be entirely done with his trade war against China, but it looks as though he already has another target in his sights: Japan.According to a report from the Wall Street Journal late on Thursday, Trump indicated to reporter James Freeman that he is ready and willing to make Japan â€œpayâ€? going forward, suggesting that tariffs on Japanese goods may be on their way.Writing in an opinion piece, Freeman says he received a phone call from the president following an appearance on Fox News, during which Trump â€œdescribed his good relations with the Japanese leadership but then added: â€˜Of course that will end as soon as I tell them how much they have to pay.'â€?During his trade salvos, Trump has imposed tariffs on China, the EU, Canada and Mexico. But so far he has only threatened to involve Japan, without actually engaging it.That now looks set to change, if Freemanâ€™s conversation with the president holds true.Japan, the worldâ€™s third-largest economy after the US and China, is a major trading partner for the US, with automobile imports particularly important.Major Japanese brands like Toyota and Honda send more than 8 million cars to the US each year, and manufacture close to 4 million within the US. Last year, more than $40 billion of Japanese autos entered the country.Trump has previously lamented that imported vehicles are a threat to national security, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe one of the strongest dissenting voices against such claims.â€œImports of our nationâ€™s automobiles and auto parts have never damaged U.S. national security and will not do so in the future,â€? Abe said at a news conference in July.â€œTrade restrictions will not benefit anyone, and we will keep explaining that to the U.S. and work closely with them to ensure those tariffs are not imposed,â€? he added.Reports of Trumpâ€™s willingness to engage Japan in his trade war come just hours before the US is expected to make public its decision on whether to levy fresh tariffs on a cumulative $200 billion worth of Chinese goods imported to the USA.A consultation period on introducing the new tariffs ended overnight, and it is widely expected that they will be imposed. The tariffs could be set at a level of 10% or 25% depending on the recommendation of the United States trade representative.The new tariffs, affecting roughly 40% of all Chinese exports to the US, would mark the biggest escalation of the trade conflict so far and would be almost guaranteed to lead to retaliatory tariffs from the Chinese government.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"caption Chinese President Xi Jinping greets U.S. President Donald Trump at a welcoming ceremony November 9, 2017 in Beijing, China. source Thomas Peter-Pool/Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump accused China of playing politics by hitting US agricultural goods with tariffs as part of the trade war.Trump claimed China was focusing on farmers because of â€œtheir loyalty toâ€? him and accused China of trying to influence the US midterm elections.Many areas hit hardest by the trade war voted for Trump in 2016.The tweets come the day after Trump hit another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods with a 10% tariff.Trump also threatened more action against China if they retaliated.On Tuesday, China retaliated.President Donald Trump accused China of politically motivated attacks focused on US farmers in the countriesâ€™ trade war in an attempt to sway the midterm elections.In a tweet Tuesday, Trump said Chinaâ€™s decision to hit US agricultural exports with tariffs was designed to alienate possible GOP voters prior to the elections in November. Analyses have shown that the areas hardest hit by the retaliatory tariffs predominately voted for Trump in 2016.But Trump was confident that these voters would not be swayed by the trade war.â€œChina has openly stated that they are actively trying to impact and change our election by attacking our farmers, ranchers and industrial workers because of their loyalty to me,â€? Trump said. â€œWhat China does not understand is that these people are great patriots and fully understand that China has been taking advantage of the United States on Trade for many years. They also know that I am the one that knows how to stop it.â€?Prices for many key US agricultural products have taken a dive since the start of the US-China trade war as Chinese importers look to other countries for their supply. This in turn has hurt many small American farmers and led to a campaign from farm lobby groups against Trumpâ€™s tariffs.The tweets come the day after Trump announced that the US would impose an additional 10% tariff on roughly $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, ranging from handbags to fish to chemicals.

"Gary Cohn and other White House officials are trying to convince President Donald Trump to soften his new tariffs.Cohn helped schedule a meeting between Trump and business executives whose companies will be hurt by the new tax on steel and aluminum imports.A group of White House advisers is making a list-ditch effort to blunt the impact of President Donald Trump's newly announced steel and aluminum tariffs.Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council and former Goldman Sachs executive, along with a group of officials in the White House and Treasury Department are attempting to convince Trump to reconsider the tariffs according to a new report from Politico's Ben White, Andrew Restuccia, and Nancy Cook.According to the report , Cohn organized a White House meeting with Trump and executives from industries that could be hurt by the tariff, which is essentially a tax on imports . These executives would be from businesses that use steel and aluminum that could see costs rise as a result of the trade restriction.Industries from canned food manufacturers to car companies have warned that the increased cost of metals could hurt their businesse and in the worst case lead to layoffs.Many economists have warned that the new tariffs could end up being detrimental to the US economy. A new study from The Trade Partnership, a consulting firm, estimated that the tariffs could cost the US economy 146,000 on net.Going beyond steel and aluminum, there is also growing worry that retaliation from other countries - including US allies like Canada and the European Union - could trigger a trade war.According to the report, Cohn and the other advisers are not relying on economic data to win over Trump since he is skeptical of economists in general. Instead, they are pointing to the stock market swoon following the tariff's announcement and backlash from GOP lawmakers to argue that Trump should soften the policy.The group also does not expect to totally win Trump over, but instead to craft a softer final policy.White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro who want increased barriers to trade.Cohn and company's attempts at softening the blow from the tariffs also continues a long-standing feud between the more free trade-focused advisers and officials like Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross andAdditionally, the move comes after reports that Cohn was considering leaving the White House after failing to block Trump from imposing the tariffs in the first place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trump imposed new tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods on Thursday, and China announced it will respond in kind.Trade experts and economists warn the fight between the two countries could be protracted and damaging.One even compared it to the Trump administration's possible version of a long, seemingly unending conflict like the war in Afghanistan.President Donald Trump last week fired the latest and perhaps most direct attack at China in an emerging trade battle, announcing new tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods in what economists say could be the start of a long, drawn-out conflict between the two superpowers.The move came in response to an investigation into the theft of US intellectual property by the Chinese government and state-controlled companies.The China-specific tariffs also follow action from the administration imposing trade restrictions on all imports of steel and aluminum, with exemptions for a handful of alliesThe Chinese government announced tariffs of their own on a range of agricultural and industrial products from the US and promised another response to Thursday's tariffs.'China is confident and capable of facing any challenge,' the embassy said in a statement. 'If a trade war were initiated by the US, China would fight to the end to defend its own legitimate interests with all necessary measures.'Given the tough talk and escalating action from both sides, a trade war appears almost inevitable. Experts warn the the effects could define Trump's economic legacy.An 'economic Afghanistan'While trade experts and economists questioned Trump's choice of tariffs to go after China, their bigger concern is that there is no end in sight for the trade conflict.Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote last week that the most worrying aspect is that there doesn't appear to be a defined goal for success.Trump's soundest argument in his election campaign was that he would not waste American lives and treasure in pointless wars of choice,' Posen wrote . 'His launching a trade war would prove, however, to be his economic Afghanistan - costly, open-ended, and fruitless.'Trump has spoken vaguely about reducing the trade deficit with China and even asked visiting Chinese officials to produce a plan to cut the $375 billion trade imbalance between the two countries by $100 billion. But Trump has not provided any specific parameters for success.The lack of clarity could lead to a protracted trade war with severe economic consequences for the US, said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.'Other than broad complaints about a series of longstanding Chinese practices such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers, the administration has not issued any clear demands,' Alden wrote Thursday. 'Instead it appears willing to leave the tariffs in place indefinitely. That is a recipe for a growing, damaging trade conflict in which China will have no choice but to retaliate.'The longer that the conflict goes on, the more likely it is to hurt US consumers.The worst-case scenarioThe history of tariffs in the US does not paint an encouraging picture. The broad tariffs of the 1930s are widely accepted as disastrous for that economy, and even targeted tariffs designed to protect the steel industry imposed by presidents over the past 40 years proved to be ineffective at best, studies say.While economists estimate Trump's new tariffs may shave off only a small amount of US economic growth, a broader fight could be more damaging and could even push the US economy into recession.A fight between the US and China could also broaden, since many countries rely on exports to China. For example, Australia derived just under 19% of its total 2017 GDP by exporting goods and services - one-third of those exports were sent to China.Many of Australia's exports are raw goods, some of which are processed into finished goods and shipped to the US. That means Australia, and other Chinese trading partners, could get caught in the crosshairs and make the conflict global.On March 5, World Trade Organization Director General Roberto Azevedo warned that a prolonged protectionist path could have global consequences.'Once we start down this path it will be very difficult to reverse direction,' Azevedo said. 'An eye for an eye will leave us all blind and the world in a deep recession.'For now, there does not appear to be a finish line. In fact, Trump promised even more blows in the near future.'This is the first of many,' Trump said while signing the tariff order. 'This is number one, but this is the first of many.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The trade battle between China and the US is heating up.China responded to recent steel and aluminum tariffs from President Donald Trump with tariffs on 128 US goods.The US will announce the details of a new round of tariffs by the end of the week.The trade fight between China and the US is heating up.Over the weekend, China unveiled its initial response to President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, as 128 US goods will be subject to new import taxes upon entrance to China.The tariffs focused on agricultural products and industrial goods - featuring an additional 25% duty on eight goods, including scrap aluminum and some types of pork, as well as a 15% duty on 120 goods, including certain types of fruits, nuts, wine, and rolled steel.The announcement comes days before the deadline for the Trump administration to announce a final list of Chinese goods that will be subject to additional 25% tariffs. In total, this second round of tariffs will hit $50 billion to $60 billion worth of Chinese goods.The China-specific US tariffs are the result of an investigation by the US Trade Representative under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The USTR specifically looked into the forced transfer of US intellectual property to Chinese firms. According to reports, the US tariffs will apply to a wide selection of goods, with a focus on technology.Once the Trump administration announces the goods, there will be a 30-day comment period before the tariffs go into effect.It's only just begunChina has not yet announced its response to the second wave of tariffs. Chris Kreuger, a strategist at Cowen Washington Research Group, said China's retaliation could hint at how they will handle the newest trade move.'The approximately $3 billion in steel and aluminum tariffs against China were reciprocated with approximately $3 billion in tariffs on 128 U.S. exports to China (tariffs of 15% to 25% on products including pork, nuts, wine, and fruits),' Kreuger wrote in a note to clients Monday. 'It is important to note that the Chinese response to 301 is still TBD. If 232 is an indicator, it is probably fairly...reciprocal.'So far China has not targeted key US exports like soybeans, which made up $14 billion in US-to-China exports in 2016, but the threat is looming over the continued fight.While tension has escalated, the two sides have reportedly opened talks about possible settlements to the trade dispute that could result in China opening its market to more US companies.This does not mean, however, that the risks of escalation are not still present. Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments, said Monday that while China is holding back for now, that does not mean the possibility of a trade war is diminished.'This is a signal that China is prepared to do more, since these tariffs were in response to US steel and aluminum tariffs, not the $60 billion in other tariffs announced by the US in response to widespread Chinese theft of US intellectual property,' Valliere said. 'Talks on this bigger issue are underway between the two countries; failure to make progress in these talks could lead to serious Chinese tariffs.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And there weâ€™ll have a full-blown trade war.Fortunately, Trump has extended a comment period before implementation until September. Meanwhile, markets on both sides of the Pacific continue unsettled â€“ at times balancing on the edge of panic.While the Chinese stock market has taken more of a beating than the American, Trump seems to think that the United States can stand the pain longer than China and tightening the screws will bring Beijing to the negotiating table. But that reflects little understanding of either the Chinese mindset or the underlying strength of the Chinese economy which, though weaker than a year ago, is still growing nearly twice as fast as the American.And this by no means reflects how bad it could get as individuals with little understanding of either the stakes or the mechanisms plunge into this pending maelstrom.Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo unveiled with some fanfare another way of dealing with, even isolating China, that approaches the ridiculous in its scale and futility. Dubbed the â€œIndo Pacific Economic Vision Programâ€? it was widely viewed as a counter to Chinaâ€™s long-standing Belt and Road development initiative that has ensnared nations across Asia and onward to Europe. But a decidedly skinflint counter. Trump has committed a derisory $113 million to his program â€“ a rounding error compared with the $900 billion estimated for Beijingâ€™s Belt and Road, which China bankrolled at $82 billion three years ago. This hardly even seems to be a competition. Yet as the South China Morning Post put it, the U.S. initiative is â€œlikely to fuel suspicions from Beijingâ€¦ and could in turn worsen relations that are already fraught with trade tensions.â€?Moreover, China seems prepared to do all it can to keep control of its global trading strategy, offering Britain talks leading to a post-Brexit free trade deal on Monday, while continuing to hold the United States at bay.For Washington to win any trade war with China â€“ or even arrive at some mutually satisfactory conclusion, the most desirable outcome in the long run â€“ there must be an understanding of the forces it will be facing. My takeaway from my interviews with Ming, which ran in full in Forbes Asia, is that large swaths of Chinaâ€™s rapidly advancing economy, especially the domestically-focused areas, are either largely immune from any trade imbroglios or will manage to circumvent them.In January, the United States barred a takeover by Alibabaâ€™s Ant Financial of Moneygram, the money transfer agency. So Alibaba created a different, in many respects more innovative, product using blockchain-based technology. â€œAny new business, while growing up, always encounters obstacles. We understand that. It is part of the cost of doing business,â€? Ming said. â€œSo we might be frustrated. But because the value we create is so overwhelming, we will find some way to overcome that barrier.â€?That doesnâ€™t mean that many Chinese companies and state-run enterprises in China arenâ€™t still poised to appropriate innovations from Silicon Valley. But the more America tries to block them, the more likely the Chinese are to come up with their own solutions.Another example: Last year, the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investmentfailed to approve an effortby Navinfo, the Chinese provider of digital maps for autos, to buy a stake in HERE, an Amsterdam-based mapping company that operates in the United States and is 15 percent owned by U.S. chipmaker Intel. So Navinfo,ranked by Forbesas of the worldâ€™s top 100 innovative growth companies, simply withdrew its offer and continued its expanding cooperation with HERE and its German-owned car company partners, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen.To be sure, while China may have a leadership role in markets like the auto market and appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines, it does still lag in fields like artificial intelligence. But, as Ming suggests, â€œitâ€™s not about our size, itâ€™s about our innovation experience and our understanding of where the future goes.â€?It is this profound understanding and acceptance of the long game that may ultimately leave China the winner in any trade war.The Chinese, and especially its leadership, have quite a strong and evolved sense of self. Their ability to withstand external forces dates back not just to Mao Zedong and the communist revolution that brought them to power after World War Two. Itâ€™s more useful to look back to the Zhou dynasty a thousand years before Christ, which based the legitimacy of its emperor on whether he was sufficiently virtuous to rule â€“ and receive theMandate from Heavento do so. A people with such an evolved sense of destiny and self-worth is unlikely to see a secular leader like Donald Trump as a major obstacle.In China, losing face is the ultimate failure. While the best, and most lasting, trade agreements must be at least perceived as a win-win, Trump now seems to have dug himself so deeply into his America First corner that it allows little room for the Chinese leadership to maneuver without losing that face. Trump must brace for a long and bruising conflict. But if he is not persuaded to give up, it is all Americans who must prepare to pay for his trade crusade.- Reuters",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"â€œThe local market was heavily reliant on imports,â€? Biobaseâ€™s chairman was quoted as saying. â€œNow, it's different. Opportunities beckon.â€?The story is from the state-run China Daily, so take it with a trailer-truck-sized grain of salt. But it makes an important point: The Chinese government is happy when its citizens buy locally made instead of American products.Of the many misperceptions driving Donald Trumpâ€™s trade policy, this may be the most dangerous: China isnâ€™t desperate to maintain its interdependent relationship with the U.S. Rather, itâ€™s a national objective to become more economically independent.Thatâ€™s a quite different China than the one in Trumpâ€™s imagination. To the White House, the country is still so reliant on the U.S. for growth and jobs that its leadership can be pounded into submission with tariffs. Itâ€™s only a question of when President Xi Jinping comes begging for mercy.In real life, Trumpâ€™s tariffs are unlikely to inflict enough pain on China to compel Xi to make concessions. Its huge domestic market is becoming more important to Chinese growth. But beyond even that, Beijingâ€™s entire economic strategy is designed to replace critical foreign technology and products with homegrown alternatives it can control. Simply, the Communist Party prefers Chinese to buy Xiaomi phones and Geely cars, not iPhones and Buicks.Thatâ€™s exactly what the much-feared â€œMade in China 2025â€? program is all about. The plan is to develop new, high-tech industries to compete with and eventually replace foreign rivals, at home and abroad. In that sense, itâ€™s official policy to limit overseas involvement in the economy.The trade war, therefore, comes as a â€œblessing in disguise,â€? as the China Daily put it. Trumpâ€™s trade sanctions have given Beijing another excuse to drag its feet on free-market reforms, to support local companies and to harass and exclude foreign business â€” all things Chinese leaders are inclined to do anyway.If anything, Trumpâ€™s tactics have only reinforced the critical importance of this quest for greater independence. Take the ZTE Corp. kerfuffle. After the Chinese telecom giant violated U.S. law, Washington almost forced the company out of business by banning U.S. suppliers from selling it crucial components. Eventually, a settlement was reached.The Chinese learned their lesson â€” just not the one Washington intended. Rather than scaring Beijing into cooperating on trade, the incident reinforced how badly the country needs its own technology. â€œWe [should] hold innovative development tightly in our own hands,â€? Xi said amid the ZTE troubles.Even more, Chinaâ€™s economic program is aimed at developing export markets other than the U.S. The China Daily was sure to mention how the Biobase chairman had a map in his office marking countries participating in Xiâ€™s pet infrastructure-building program, the Belt and Road Initiative.The goal of that plan is to entrench the country in new developing economies in order to expand the role of Chinese business. In this way, Beijing is striving to create its own economic bloc.None of this means Beijing wonâ€™t negotiate a trade deal with Trump. Nor does Beijingâ€™s policy make sense from a purely economic perspective. Chinese growth prospects would be better served by further integration and cooperation with the U.S., to maintain access to American consumers and technology. And since momentum in Chinaâ€™s economy already appears to be weakening, it can ill afford the added headwinds created by slowing world trade.But Beijing sees its development plan as critical for national security and the countryâ€™s rise on the world stage. Thereâ€™s no place in this great mission for Intel Corp., Apple Inc. or General Motors Co. That means Xi may be in less of a hurry to seek a trade deal than Trump assumes, and will only conclude one that doesnâ€™t endanger his broader economic agenda.The bottom line is that China is content to go its own way on its own terms.

"IT HOLDS devastating implications for the global economy â€” but it seems China wants to keep Donald Trumpâ€™s trade war as quiet as it can.The Chinese Government is restricting its coverage of the trade war with the US, so as not to spark fears among its 1.37 billion citizens.Chinese reporters have reportedly been given specific instructions on how to cover the events, with warnings to tread especially carefully around the term â€œtrade warâ€?.CHINA RESTRICTS TRADE TALKJournalists working for the Chinese media have been instructed not to â€œover-reportâ€? on the imposed tariffs, and to take extra care not to link it to drops in the stock market and the depreciation of the yuan, Chinaâ€™s currency.According to the South China Morning Post, one source from an official Chinese media outlet said: â€œWhen you report a fall in the stock market index or a weakening in the yuanâ€™s exchange rate, you canâ€™t use â€˜trade warâ€™ in your headline.â€?Another said local media outlets have been advised to republish what state-controlled media writes about it and not â€œoverplayâ€? the issue.In its latest editorial on the trade war, published yesterday, state media mouthpiece the Global Times called for a compromise between Beijing and Washington.â€œThe trade war hurts both China and the US,â€? it said. â€œChina must make resolute strategy from the very beginning to maximise its impact on the US and resilience here at home. It needs to overwhelm the US with capability and willpower to make Washington compromise.â€?Itâ€™s a marked change from Beijingâ€™s usually aggressive approach to countries it deems hostile.Even Australia has come under the firing line, with repeated threats from Chinaâ€™s state media outlets over foreign influence laws, our position on the South China Sea and our alliance with the US.media_camera Chinaâ€™s economy faces a slowdown, but the government wants to restrict how itâ€™s portrayed in the media.In the lead-up to the trade war, the Chinese Government ordered state media not to report on comments from Mr Trump or US officials over the trade conflict.A propaganda notice leaked online earlier this month instructed the media not to â€œattackâ€? Mr Trumpâ€™s â€œvulgarityâ€? or be insulting.â€œDonâ€™t relay comments from Trump, from US government spokespersons, or from US officials,â€? the notice said, according to censorship-monitoring site China Digital Times. â€œDonâ€™t relay US news reports or commentary on the trade conflict without waiting for response from the Ministry of Commerce. Donâ€™t attack Trumpâ€™s vulgarity; donâ€™t make this a war of insults.â€?It went on: â€œAll media should prepare well for protracted conflict. Donâ€™t follow the American sidesâ€™ fluctuating declarations.â€?It also reinforced that media must not mention â€œMade in China 2025â€?, a long-range development plan for creating powerful Chinese entities in such areas as information technology, robotics, aerospace equipment, electric vehicles and biopharmaceuticals.The warnings come as the Chinese Government worries over its slowing economy â€” a move that could affect Australia.WHY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS WORRIEDThe trade war is just part of a wider problem for the Chinese Government â€” the countryâ€™s slowing economy.The countryâ€™s economy has slowed down faster than expected, while China continues attempting to tackle a sea of ingrained debt â€” just as trade tensions with the United States are heating up.Chinaâ€™s economy grew by 6.7 per cent in the second quarter of the year, marking its slowest rate of quarterly growth in nearly two years.This slowdown is modest, but the US-led trade war has only just begun, and itâ€™s set to accelerate.media_camera As Donald Trumpâ€™s tariffs on the Chinese Government get under way, the Chinese Communist Party appears worried.Earlier this month, Washington and Beijing imposed tariffs of 25 per cent on $US34 billion ($A45 billion) of each otherâ€™s exports. US tariffs on an additional $16 billion ($A21 billion) of Chinese goods are on the way, with additional tariffs of $200 billion ($A269 billion) being readied.In other words, this is just the beginning of Chinaâ€™s pain, and itâ€™s expected to be felt more as the year goes on.China generates as much as a third of global growth, which could make this a concerning sign for the world economy.If the trade war escalates further, China wonâ€™t be the only affected country.European businesses fear it could spell the biggest single threat to the economic upswing that helped the region get past its financial crisis.The Chinese Government previously warned the US tariffs will not only hurt China and the US, but the rest of the world, because $20 billion ($A27 billion) of the affected $34 billion ($A45 billion) goods are produced by foreign companies.Economists have also warned that a fully fledged trade war will slow the US economy, and many individual businesses could soon endure hardship as a result.China is Australiaâ€™s largest and most important trading partner, and there are fears Chinaâ€™s stalling growth could affect our economy.Treasurer Scott Morrison recently told a Perth business forum that the US-China tit-for-tat is â€œquite seriousâ€?.â€œWe must bear in mind that with the global economy having turned the corner in the last 18 months, we cannot allow it to now inflict some sort of economic self-harm by allowing these sorts of exchanges to run away,â€? Mr Morrison said.However, the treasurer added: â€œThere is no reason to think this cannot be kept under reasonable management.â€?He said countries like Australia, China, Canada, the UK and the US were now â€œcompletely immersed in global tradeâ€?, having been much less so two decades ago. The issue needed to be managed with a clear focus on stronger growth, more jobs and taking more people out of poverty, he said.â€œIf these issues arenâ€™t managed with cool heads â€¦ then the world is at great risk of scoring a massive own goal,â€?

(Photo: Dax Melmer/Windsor Star)Itâ€™s common, Diane Pineault explained, for Canadians who live near the border to have items sent to U.S. addresses to save on shipping. And candles are much less expensive in the U.S., even factoring in taxes that must be paid when the goods are formally imported.So Laura, a Ph.D. student at Wayne State University who like her mother is a dual U.S.-Canadian citizen, was tasked with acting as Momâ€™s import agent, going through the commercial line on the Canadian side of the tunnel that connects Detroit and Windsor. She filled out computerized forms for what she expected to be a routine process.She was unaware that candles were among the U.S. products slapped with Canadian tariffs in retaliation for President Donald Trumpâ€™s 25 percent levy on Canadian steel. So she was surprised when she was told to bring a candle into the border station. An agent inspected it, consulted with a colleague and determined it was subject to a 10 percent tariff on top of the 8 percent commercial tax.Laura paid $40 on the spot on the $230 worth of candles and was on her way.â€œIt seemed like I was importing something really bad,â€? she said. â€œItâ€™s a candle.â€?Such incidents are becoming more common at border cities such as Detroit and Windsor. With thousands of visitors, workers, shoppers and tourists each day crossing the Detroit River that separates the two cities, delays and misunderstandings have cropped up with increasing frequency.Laurie Tannous, an immigration lawyer and vice president of government relations at Farrow, a Canadian freight handler, noted that the region's many cross-border grocery shoppers who had typically zipped through customs with at best minor delays are facing greater scrutiny.'Weâ€™re seeing the border service officers looking at the items on the list to determine whether the surtaxes need to be applied,' she said. 'Grocery shoppers are saying, 'Hey, weâ€™re getting pulled over more, weâ€™re being charged these taxes.''And what some call this 'thickening' of the border stymies not just shoppers but other travelers as well.'Itâ€™s been awful for people going both ways â€” just the delays, the extra questions, the scrutiny,' Tannous said. 'My phone blows up every morning. Between 5 a.m. and 8 a.m., I get at least two more requests from people going either into the U.S. or into Canada who used to go without issue and now are having problems. So in terms of the people movement, even though it's got nothing to do with the tariff and trade issue, people are feeling it.'So far, most over-the-road truckers crossing the border don't worry about tariffs because freight-forwarding companies such as Farrow typically put up bonds to cover duties that are calculated and paid after the fact. But that, too, could get worse if the trade war escalates.Could trucks be inspected?'It could get to a point where officers are doubting how a good has been classified and whether it should be classified as something else,' Tannous said. 'And that could trigger a de-vanning of commercial loads, going both ways in fact. That could cause a disruption.'Forcing an unloading and inspection of commercial truck loads at the border could do more than create massive traffic jams on the Ambassador Bridge connecting Detroit and Windsor. By slowing the pace of commerce, it would also hurt the economies of both nations.'If this trade war continues, if these tariffs stay in place, I think we could get to that level,' Tannous said.This in-your-face experience of a trade war is not how most Americans feel the effects of higher tariffs. For the vast majority, tariffs may translate into higher prices at the grocery store or car dealership, but those increases may be masked by seasonal shortages and competitive factors.The Ambassador Bridge is one of the busiest border crossings in North America.

Take Travis Fahley, who grows corn, wheat and soybeans on a 2,500-acre family farm in Yale, Michigan, about 70 miles north of Detroit. Some of Fahley's output, especially his soybeans, wind up in China and other Asian nations after first being sold to and processed by a company in western Michigan, and so are subject to China's tariffs on U.S. goods.Soybean prices have dropped sharply as the tariffs imposed by both nations have begun to bite and buyers are finding ways to avoid the higher prices. But Fahley said itâ€™s difficult to discern the exact impact from tariffs at a time when agricultural prices have softened generally and farmers like himself have to deal with many other variables from weather to seed and fuel prices.Asked how he would rank tariffs with all the other variables that farmers face â€” weather, crop prices, the cost of seed and fuel, and so much more â€” Fahley places concerns over trade â€œin the middle of the pack.â€?â€œFor us personally, itâ€™s on our radar, weâ€™re aware of it, weâ€™re watching it, weâ€™re monitoring it, but we understand that we have to let these things work themselves through,â€? he said.But concerns over tariffs could rise over the winter and and into spring when he and other Michigan farmers map out what to plant. If prices for his soybeans collapse because Chinese customers are buying elsewhere, Fahley may plant fewer soybeans and more corn and wheat on his acreage.â€œFarmers are being as sensitive and as frugal as they can,â€?

"Shares, Johannesburg, South Africa, Jul 24 â€“ Leaders of the BRICS emerging economies â€” Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa â€” will meet in Johannesburg this week, with the threat of a worsening global trade war topping the agenda.US President Donald Trumpâ€™s hardening stance has compounded fears of an all-out trade war after he slapped levies on goods from China worth tens of billions of dollars as well as tariffs on steel and aluminium from the EU, Canada and Mexico.Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinaâ€™s President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend the annual three-day summit opening in Johannesburg on Wednesday.Earlier this month, China said that it would step up cooperation with other developing nations like the BRICS grouping to counter â€œtrade protectionismâ€?.China on Monday rejected accusations by Trump that it was manipulating the yuan to give its exporters an edge, saying Washington appeared â€œbent on provoking a trade warâ€?.Trump has said he is ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of China imports, complaining that Chinaâ€™s trade surplus with the US is due to unfair currency manipulation.â€œAs to the US being bent on provoking a trade war, China does not want a trade war but is not afraid,â€? Chinaâ€™s foreign ministry spokesman said when asked about Trumpâ€™s threat to impose the across-the-board tariffs on Chinese goods.Russian Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin said last week ahead of the Johannesburg meeting that â€œthis summit is about the context â€” we are at a time when the US and China announce new measures almost every weekâ€?.He said much of the discussions with China would likely focus on what is happening with the United States.â€œThis is a trade war, so leadersâ€™ discussions are particularly important in coordinating our positions,â€? said Oreshkin.â€“ A unifying cause? â€“Sreeram Chaulia, of the Jindal School of International Affairs outside Delhi, said BRICS leaders would â€œconcur that the US has unleashed punitive trade wars that are hurting all the BRICS membersâ€?.â€œThey have a collective interest in promoting intra-BRICS trade. The urgency this time is greater,â€? he said.The BRICS group, comprising more than 40 percent of the global population, represents some of the biggest emerging economies, but has struggled to find a unified voice â€” as well as achieving sharply different growth rates.Analysts say US trade policy could give the group some renewed momentum.â€œTrade agreements between associations of countries like BRICS have become increasingly important given the self-seeking, and ultimately short-sighted, barriers to trade that are being instigated by the US,â€? Kenneth Creamer, an economist at Johannesburgâ€™s Wits University, told AFP.â€œSouth Africa, and Africa more broadly, can benefit from increasing exports to fast growing countries like India and China. BRICS has the strategic potential to re-shape world trade.â€?The trade war risk also dominated a meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers at the weekend in Buenos Aires, while International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde again spoke out against the tit-for-tat tariffs.Chinaâ€™s President Xi was due to hold bilateral talks with South African Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday after visiting Senegal and Rwanda as part of a whistlestop tour to cement relations with African allies.Signalling diplomatic rivalry over influence in Africa, Indiaâ€™s Narendra Modi is visiting Rwanda and Uganda on his own five-day tour of the continent including the BRICS summit.Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan will also attend a summit as the current chair of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Erdogan will reportedly meet Putin on the summitâ€™s sidelines.European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker travels to Washington on Wednesday to meet Trump as part of the EUâ€™s effort to head off a trade war.burs-mgu-bgs/rl",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Every week the news cycle seems to deliver a brand new bombshell, followed by panic and endless commentary decrying a nationalist shift in U.S. policy positions. Trade policy provides a prominent example. Though it is exciting to see broader interest in the trade debate, the tendency to declare every little thought or action taken by the administration or by U.S. trade partners as a sign of a trade war is getting a little out of hand. Like the boy who cried â€œwolf,â€? the mediaâ€™s incessant â€œtrade warâ€? refrains are losing credibility. Yes, there are trade disputes. There is trade conflict. And, perhaps, there are even trade skirmishes. But when every little administrative action or tweet is treated as part and parcel to â€œwar,â€? it gets difficult to take the reporting seriously.For instance, recent reports that the Canadian government thought the Trump administration was planning to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) caused immediate shock, riling North American markets, despite the fact that the reports were mere speculation. Moreover, the rumor was based on something President Trump has been saying all along: If a deal that favors the United States canâ€™t be reached, he would withdraw from NAFTA. (Thatâ€™s a position not too different from those mouthed by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail in 2008). Yes, itâ€™s true that the 6th round of NAFTA talks is scheduled to begin January 21st, and many are nervous about its outcome. However, it is also true that every round has been touted as the â€œtipping pointâ€? in the negotiations. But just this week, President Trump suggested that he was open to continuing negotiations until after the elections in Mexico this summer. Those donâ€™t sound like the words of someone preparing to kill NAFTA anytime soon.In addition, there have been a number of needless alarm bells rung regarding a recent action by Canada at the World Trade Organization (WTO). On January 10, Canada requested consultations with the United States regarding certain aspects of U.S. trade remedy laws. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer called the action, â€œa broad and ill-advised attack on the U.S. trade remedies system,â€? and others suggested that the action was an unnecessary provocation by Canada that could threaten to derail the NAFTA talks.First, for domestic political reasons, Lighthizer had to respond strongly, so we shouldnâ€™t be reading too much into his statement. Second, there is nothing extraordinary about Canadaâ€™s request, as the issues brought up have been lingering for a long time. Though the timing may seem inconvenient, given ongoing NAFTA negotiations, it could also be seen as Canada trying to get some leverage in relation to the resolution of the softwood lumber dispute. Third, Canada is unlikely to take any action that would seriously harm its most important trading relationship. It is worth remembering that the Canadian Constitution enshrines the principle of â€œpeace, order and good government,â€? so it is actually rather un-Canadian to rock the boat, so to speak.Finally, just because a country files a request for consultation does not mean that the issue will lead to contentious litigation. In fact, of the 537 requests for consultations that have been filed since 1995, roughly a third have led to formal dispute settlement. Many disputes are settled or dropped before formal adjudication begins because the complainant accomplished its goal of getting another member to sit down and resolve a problem quickly and amicably. Following a request for consultation at the WTO, the respondent (the defending member government) has 10 days to reply, after which a consultation period of up to 30 days ensues. The parties have a total of 60 days to come to some sort of agreement from the date the request was originally made. If not, the complainant can request the formation of a panel to hear the dispute. These steps are all very important, but also explain why consultation requests on their own are no reason for alarm. Consultations facilitate diplomacy and often prevent litigation.While the Trump administrationâ€™s unconventional approach to trade policy (as well as our partnersâ€™ reactions) may keep us on our toes, it is essential that we separate the trade policy signal from the noise. The ambush of frivolous news should not distract us from the important issues, such as recent and potential U.S. reactions to Chinaâ€™s alleged intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, and cyber-threats, as well as the administrationâ€™s blocking of appointments to the WTOâ€™s appellate body.While the stakes of NAFTA withdrawal are high, and the administrationâ€™s skepticism about the WTO is apparent, there hasnâ€™t been much in the way of actual policy change that should cause us to panic. Letâ€™s all take deep breaths and get back to doing our parts to preserve and improve the current trading system rather than ringing the alarm when thereâ€™s no fire.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Donald Trump's White House this week escalated its trade war, adding tariffs of 10 percent on another $200 billion on imported Chinese goods effective Sept. 24. That penalty will rise to 25 percent beginning Jan. 1.China retaliated on Tuesday as promised, following through with its own tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. goods from aircraft to liquified natural gas. That means the U.S. will start work on Mr. Trump's previous threats to impose tariffs on all of the remaining imported goods from China, the U.S.'s biggest trading partner last year. That would mean another $267 billion of Chinese imports would be subject to U.S. tariffs.Here's the problem for China: The U.S. imports far more Chinese goods than China imports from the U.S. That means China can't directly impose retaliatory tariffs equal to Mr. Trump's promise to hit the remaining $267 billion of Chinese imports because the U.S. simply doesn't export enough goods to China.That led Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in an interview with CNBC Tuesday to say China is 'out of bullets' when it comes to tariffs.But rather than surrender quickly, China could deploy other tactics if the Trump administration follows through and taxes every Chinese good coming into the U.S. While Beijing has taken a measured approach so far in its response, economists and strategists say what happens next is less certain.'Non-tariff measures are a wildcard, with sales restrictions now a risk,' UBS strategist Keith Parker wrote in a note to clients.Here's a look at some of the possible bullets China still has its disposal:Regulation and disruption for U.S. companies in ChinaChina's state-dominated and heavily regulated economy gives authorities an arsenal of tools to disrupt U.S. companies by withholding licenses or launching tax, antimonopoly or other investigations. Beijing could also slow down customs clearance, delay visa applications, or use health and safety rules to stifle operations, some economists said.When Beijing rejected Qualcomm's purchase of rival NXPI, it showed a 'willingness to use regulatory action against the US,' Height Capital analyst Clayton Allen wrote in a note.U.S. companies have long complained that China can make it difficult for them to access its massive market and sometimes doesn't play fair under global trade rules. But most don't support tariffs as a way to prompt better behavior from Beijing.Consumer boycottsChina's state-controlled media previously encouraged consumer boycotts against Japanese and South Korean products over disputes with those countries, a signal they could take similar actions against U.S. companies.Last year, the Chinese government closed most of South Korean retailer Lotte's supermarkets in China after the company's sale of South Korean land to be used for an antimissile system inside its own country. Chinese leaders opposed the move. Though the relationship was later mended, Lotte sold its China operations.'President Xi's comment in the summer that China 'punches back' appeared to be a threat that U.S. firms could be targeted for regulatory harassment and consumer boycotts as Japanese and Korean firms have been in previous geopolitical disputes,' Mark Williams, chief China economist for Capital Economics, said in a note this week.Restrict or block some exports, like rare earth metalsChina supplies roughly 78 percent of the rare-earth metals used in the U.S. to manufacture batteries that power products from hybrid autos to consumer electronics, according to Bloomberg.China's 2010 block on rare earth exports to Japan 'shows a willingness to restrict exports,' Height Capital's Allen noted. Perhaps that's one reason some of those materials were taken off the the hit list in latest round of $200 billion in U.S. tariffs.Shift trade relationships to other areasChinese billionaire Jack Ma, Alibaba Group's chairman, told investors the trade war will last longer than most think. He urged China to strengthen its economy and shift trade relationships to areas like Southeast Asia and Africa, according to Bloomberg.'Short term, business communities in China, U.S., Europe will all be in trouble,' Ma said, according to Bloomberg. 'This thing will last long. If you want a short-term solution, there is no solution.'Shore up domestic industryPolicymakers in Beijing are likely to temper about half of the U.S. tariff impact by stoking domestic demand, including 'easing of monetary and fiscal policy' already begun in the second quarter, Louis Kuijs, Oxford Economics' lead Asia economist, wrote in a note.Such measures could include lower income taxes, calls for lower social insurance contributions, 'higher export-tax rebates, more infrastructure financing and encouraging banks to expand lending,' Kuijs wrote.Slow investments in the U.S.One response to the trade war from both U.S. and foreign companies is to think twice before investing to expand in the U.S. 'Companies that rely on global supply chains will likely hold off investment decisions given the uncertainty around tariffs,' Moody's wrote.Already, foreign direct investment in the U.S. has slowed dramatically under President Trump, Adam Posen, president of the Peterson International Institute, argued in a piece last month for Foreign Affairs.-- The Associated Press contributed to this story.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trump's threat to slap heavy tariffs on imported cars and auto parts may cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs and raise the cost of your next vehicle by roughly 10 percent, economists estimate.Echoing their dire predictions are companies, industry groups, global trading partners and even local city governments in comments about the proposal they've submitted to the U.S. Commerce Department pleading for Mr. Trump not to impose the 25 percent tariffs.With the agency on Thursday starting two days of hearings to consider the plan, bets are Mr. Trump will enact the tariffs anyway. UBS strategists expect the U.S. to impose the car levies by year-end (though not on auto parts).Here's what the fight is about:U.S. trade is 'basically all about cars'As part of a series of charts sent to clients this month, Torsten SlÃ¸k, chief international economist Deutsche Bank, recently wrote that U.S. trade is 'basically all about cars.' U.S. production accounts for about 2.7 percent of GDP, and for every motor-vehicle assembly job, 10 are created, his slideshow points out. That's more jobs than in computers and electronics, chemicals, motor vehicle parts alone, plastics and rubber, or food.Cars from Germany, Japan and Korea are listed as the most important U.S. imports, while car parts are the most important from Mexico, SlÃ¸k's analysis showed. Cars are the second-most important import from Canada and the U.K., along with auto parts from Japan.The National Auto Alliance estimates that in the U.S. about 7.25 million jobs are tied to the industry directly: 2.44 million are employed by automakers, 1.6 million by dealers and another 3.16 billion by auto suppliers.Auto and related industries are against the proposed tariffsThis week, a group representing the auto industry released a public letter to Mr. Trump imploring him not to impose the tariffs. U.S. trade depends so much on autos and auto parts that American workers and drivers could suffer the biggest hits from the threatened tariffs, they argued. Mr. Trump has implied he'll use the threat as a bargaining chip to gain better trade deals.That might make the hearings ineffective, some economists argued.'This is a show trial,' Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics told The Wall Street Journal. 'This is something where they predetermined the verdict and the schedule on which the verdict would be read.'Many foreign carmakers build automobiles containing big hunks of U.S. parts and other content. The same is true of foreign cars and U.S. part content.General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) have large percentages of foreign auto parts in their vehicles, sometimes more than half. GM recently warned the tariffs would hurt business and mean a 'smaller GM' and fewer jobs, thanks to higher costs.Tariffs could drive up vehicle pricesIn June, manufacturing overall rebounded -- mainly because of a 7.8 percent increase in auto-related production. About 75 percent of the 0.8 percent total rise came from cars, according to a recent note from Oxford economics.The top 10 most popular vehicles will be more expensive for U.S. consumers if tariffs go into effect, and prices will go up as much as $3,410, according to recent calculations from AutoWise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stocks have swung wildly in recent weeks as Wall Street responds to the deepening trade rift between the U.S. and China.Stocks were rattled badly last week as this dynamic intensified, dipping as President Trump said he was considering another $100 billion tariffs, and then sinking quickly when Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin acknowledged the 'potential' for a trade war. But markets cheered on Tuesday after Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a speech promising to ease trade barriers.If you want to get a read on how investors are sizing up the state of trade talks with China, zero on these four: Boeing, Caterpillar, Deere and Tyson. They've suffered larger losses than the overall market when tensions are high, and enjoyed larger gains when talk shifts to 'negotiation.'Take four 'trade freakout' days: March 1, March 22, April 2 and April 6. A basket of these four stocks fell an average of 3.2 percent, versus a 2.1 percent decline for the S&P 500.On 'trade relief' days -- March 7, March 8, April 3, and April 5 â€” they rallied 0.9 percent versus 0.6 percent for the S&P.Consider Boeing. Commercial aircraft sales are arguably the single most important manufactured export category for the U.S. into China. In fact, when Trump visited China last November, one of the trade 'gets' was a $37 billion order from China Aviation Supplies Holding Company for 300 Boeing planes.On March 1, Boeing shares fell 3.5 percent, compared with a decline of 1.5 percent for the S&P. That was the day Trump announced sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum. On March 22, the day the White House $50 billion in tariffs in China, Boeing fell 5.2 percent, versus a 2.5 percent drop.The moves were similar for the other three stocks in our 'trade war' portfolio. Caterpillar and Deere are both exposed to a possible slowdown in heavy equipment sales to China as well as a possible drag on U.S. farmers, with Beijing threatening a tariff on U.S. soybean exports. Animal protein producer Tyson would be hurt by China's threat of tariffs on American pork.Mr. Trump's economic team are in a tough spot. They have to acknowledge that the threat of tariffs is real while simultaneously stressing that negotiations are ongoing with the aim of a peaceful -- and profitable -- outcome.To know which part investors are focusing on, track our four stocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Worsening trade relations with China are likely to hurt U.S. economic growth next year, according to Moody's Investors Service.The stark warning comes as the U.S. on Thursday imposed the final tranche of tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods, with China retaliating in kind by placing new levies on American goods. Trade envoys from both countries are meeting in Washington this week for their first high-level talks in months, but without signs of progress.Moody's forecasts that higher American tariffs on Chinese imports could reduce U.S. gross domestic product in 2019 by 0.25 percent, to an annualized rate of 2.3 percent, offsetting some of the gains from last year's tax cuts. But the economy would take a bigger hit if the U.S. proceeds with President Trump's threat to impose 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, as well as steep duties on cars and auto parts.'The implementation of either would pose a large adverse shock through multiple channels, and would signify a serious escalation in the trade dispute.â€¦, ' Moody's analysts said in a report. 'At 25 percent, the tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products will likely result in significant price increases for a number of products consumed in the U.S.'The Trump administration shows no signs of backing down as it confronts China over trade issues. The U.S. Trade Representative on Monday began a week-long session of planned hearings on the proposed $200 billion in tariffs. Mr. Trump is also considering a similar duty on every auto and auto part that enters the U.S.Mr. Trump and U.S. trade officials argue that China forces American companies business to effectively hand over intellectual property, such as patents, in exchange for doing business in China. He is seeking to punish China under a part of a 1974 trade law, commonly known as Section 301, that allows for tariffs.Yet most U.S. companies oppose hiking tariffs, saying a trade war risks stifling global growth and resulting in the loss of American jobs. Mr. Trump doubled down in July and said he's willing to place tariffs on all Chinese imports, or more than $500 billion, if no agreement is reached.Escalating trade tensions come at a delicate time for the U.S. and global economies. While noting the robust job growth in the U.S. and surging confidence by businesses, '[W]e think that growth is peaking, and rising trade tensions come at a time when global activity is already slowing,' Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics said in a client note.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While China last week announced its possible retaliatory plans against US tariffs, the countryâ€™s premier Li Keqiang reiterated on Monday pledges to open its market to American businesses.Li was quoted in a Reuters report as telling a conference attended by global chief executives that China would treat foreign and domestic forms equally.In addition, he pledged that the country would strengthen intellectual property rights while refraining from forcing foreign firms to transfer technology.On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview with a Fox TV program that the US wants China to stop forcing US firms to transfer technology when entering the market and lower its tariffs on US goods.While Mnuchin said that he's hopeful that the US can reach deal with China to avoid a trade war, he reiterated that the US is going to proceed with the proposed tariffs if negotiation fails.'We are working on that. We're also working on investment restrictions, but we're simultaneously having negotiations with the Chinese to see if we can reach an agreement,' Mnuchin said.'I'm cautiously hopeful we'll reach an agreement, but if not we are proceeding with these tariffs. We are not putting them on hold unless we have an acceptable agreement that the president signs off on,' he added.China has also offered to buy more semiconductors from the US by diverting some purchases from South Korea and Taiwan, according to a Financial Times report that cites anonymous sources.In addition, the country is working to finalize rules that allow foreign firms to take majority stakes in Chinese securities firms by May, instead of June in its original schedule, the report adds.China demands compensation from the US in WTO filingsMeanwhile, China also asked the US to compensate for lost due to Trumpâ€™s proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum.In two filings with WTO on Monday, China dismissed the US assertion that the metal tariffs were instituted on national security grounds, arguing instead that they were safeguard measures -- temporary trade restrictions aimed at protecting domestic producers, Bloomberg reports.If the US rejects Chinaâ€™s argument that the measures are safeguards, China may have recourse to ask the WTO to mediate the disagreement in a formal dispute proceeding, the report says, adding that China stated that it reserved the right to file a dispute at a later date, according to the filings.Fitch: Tariffs unlikely to have significant impact on Chinese or global economyWhile trade war is seen to cause loss to almost all economies, Fitch Ratings does not believe the USâ€™ proposal to impose tariffs on US$50 billion-US$60 billion worth of imports from China would have a significant impact on the Chinese or global economy.â€œThe risk that piecemeal protectionist measures escalate into a more damaging trade war has risen in recent months, but China's measured response so far and US indications of openness to negotiation suggest this scenario should still be avoided,â€? said the rating agency in a recent statement.US$60 billion is equivalent to around 2.5% of China's total merchandise exports, or 0.5% of its GDP, but the impact of the tariffs on the Chinese economy would be much smaller, Fitch pointed out.â€œSome of these goods will still end up going to the US, given the lack of substitutes, while others could be diverted to different markets,â€? the rating agency noted.In addition, the domestic value-added content of China's exports is typically only around two-thirds, or less than one-half in the case of ICT goods, which contain a high proportion of imported inputs, Fitch observed.â€œOverall, we would not expect these tariffs to create a drag on Chinese GDP growth of much more than 0.1 percentage point this year,â€? it said.The bigger riskThe bigger risk is that the US eventually imposes across-the-board tariffs on China, either because its bilateral trade deficit with China stays large or in the context of an escalating trade war between the two countries, according to Fitch.The US accounts for almost one-fifth of China's total exports, equivalent to 3.6% of Chinese GDP, so broader tariffs could have a sizeable impact on China's economy, and would have knock-on effects for the supply chain across the rest of Asia, the company said.â€œThis more severe scenario cannot be ruled out, but we still expect new policies, either from the US or China in retaliation, to continue to fall under sector-specific measures,â€? Fitch noted. â€œAnd the 30-day consultation period following the release of US tariff details should temper the prospect of immediate escalation and could provide time for a compromise to be reached.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Friday (Jun 15) ignited his trade war with China, slapping tariffs on tens of billions in Chinese imports and sparking immediate retaliation from Beijing.The moves brought the world's two largest economies to the verge of an all-out confrontation long feared by markets and industry.AdvertisementThe announcement also caps months of sometimes fraught shuttle diplomacy in which Chinese offers to purchase more American goods failed to assuage Trump's grievances over the soaring trade imbalance and China's aggressive industrial development policies.And as Trump warned of 'additional tariffs' should Beijing hit back with tit-for-tat duties on American goods, China nevertheless unveiled 25 per cent duties on US$50 billion in US imports.'The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,' Trump said.'These tariffs are essential to preventing further unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China, which will protect American jobs.'AdvertisementAdvertisementBut at least initially, the new tariffs will not cover the full US$50 billion that Trump announced Friday.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the punitive duties will apply on 818 Chinese products valued at US$34 billion starting Jul 6.The USTR announced a second list of 284 goods valued at US$16 billion that will be subject to review and public comment before the penalties take effect.sentifi.com Channel NewsAsia - Sentifi topic widgetIf tariffs are imposed on the full amount in the second list, that would bring the total goods sanctioned to US$50 billion. But it is likely companies will seek more exemptions so the final total could fall short of that amount.About 500 goods initially targeted for sanctions in March were stricken from the list at the behest of US firms that rely on imports.Beijing's countermeasures closely mirrored Washington's, with 545 American exports, also valued at US$34 billion, facing punitive duties as of Jul 6, including agricultural products and vehicles, according to the official news agency Xinhua.The State Council said another 114 items will be subject to tariffs at a later date, the news agency said.US farmers are especially concerned about the impact of a trade war, since they are sure to feel the hit.STINGING REPRISALS AS VOTE LOOMSChina's Ministry of Commerce said the decision to impose tariffs meant 'all previously agreed trade negotiation results are no longer valid.''It is deeply regrettable that in disregard of the consensus between the two sides, the US has demonstrated flip-flops and ignited a trade war,' the ministry said.It also called on other countries to 'take collective action' against this 'outdated and backwards behaviour.'But the White House maintains that any Chinese countermeasures would be unjust and could be met with further US sanctions.'We have taken essentially a defensive action,' a senior US official told reporters, adding that 'further threats that are going to hurt other industries ... would be a mistake.'The official, who asked not to be identified, declined to say whether Trump would make good on a March threat to hit another US$100 billion in Chinese goods with tariffs in response to Beijing's retaliation.China in April already put punitive duties on 128 US goods, including pork, wine and certain pipes in response to global US tariffs on steel and aluminium imposed by Trump the month before.The China trade offensive is only one side of Trump's multi-front battle with all major US economic partners.Trump outraged Canadian, Mexican and European leaders last month by imposing the steel and aluminium tariffs to protect American producers from allegedly unfair competition.Brussels, Ottawa, Beijing and Mexico City already have shown they intend to inflict damage on export industries in politically-sensitive voting districts - something which could prove damaging to Republicans already facing a loss of power in November's mid-term elections.On Capitol Hill, influential Texas Republican lawmaker Kevin Brady, chairman of a House tax legislation committee, said he was 'alarmed' by the tariffs which he said exposed US industries to 'devastating retaliation.''I am concerned that these new tariffs will hurt American manufacturers, farmers, workers and consumers,' he said.And the powerful US Chamber of Commerce warned that hundreds of thousands of Americans could lose their jobs if the trade war escalated and included the auto import tariffs that Trump has threatened.'If these actions continue, our businesses will lose customers, workers will lose jobs, and American consumers will lose family income through higher taxes and higher prices,' Chamber President Thomas Donahue said.He also noted that the metals tariffs have pushed steel prices 40 per cent higher since January.Trump's tariff announcement knocked Wall Street lower, closing down 0.4 per cent.

"This period of unprecedented prosperity is being threatened by a sense that not everyone benefits from global integration, says former US Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H Summers.MASSACHUSETTS: Since the end of World War II, a broad consensus in support of global economic integration as a force for peace and prosperity has been a pillar of the international order.Since the fall of the Berlin Wall a generation ago, the power of markets in promoting economic progress has been universally recognised.AdvertisementFrom global trade agreements to the European Union project; from the Bretton Woods institutions to the removal of pervasive capital controls; from expanded foreign direct investment to increased flows of people across borders, the direction has been clear.Driven by domestic economic progress, by integrative technologies such as container shipping and the internet, and by legislative changes within and between nations, the world has grown smaller and more closely connected.This has proved more successful than could reasonably have been hoped. We have not seen a war between leading powers.Global living standards have risen faster than at any point in history. And material progress has coincided with even more rapid progress in combating hunger, empowering women, promoting literacy and extending life.AdvertisementAdvertisementBACKLASH AGAINST GLOBAL INTEGRATIONEvery single day since 1990 there were an average of 108,000 fewer people in extreme poverty.Since the beginning of the 21st century, global life expectancy has increased by more than four months a year. A world that will have more smartphones than adults within a few years is a world in which more is possible for more people than ever before.People living in extreme poverty has decreased since 1990 (Photo: AFP/Norberto DUARTE)Yet a backlash against the current paradigm of global integration is reshaping politics and economic policy in a way that may plague us for years. The momentum toward global economic integration was stopped when the US repudiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership.As I write this, worries of a trade war between the US, China and other countries have materialised, leaving a wide range of industries and countries anticipating substantial losses.History with respect to the result of such trade wars â€” most notably the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act â€” is not encouraging. The International Monetary Fund estimates that rising trade tensions between the US and the rest of the world could cost the global economy 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product, or US$430 billion, by 2020.The shift away from openness extends to immigration and capital flows as well. The EU, notable for its commitment to the free movement of people, is shifting toward much tougher immigration policies.New immigration policies in the US have turned police officers into immigration-enforcement agents and hurt business growth.Restrictions on foreign investment have been increasingly common as the US has taken to blocking Chinese investments, China has set unfair terms for US companies wishing to invest there, and Europe has increasingly favoured domestic companies over foreign competitors.The backlash against global integration has many sources. Some of it reflects broader economic frustrations associated with slower growth and rising inequality. Some reflects the difficulties of maintaining harmony within multiethnic societies.A woman holds a sign in a protest against US President Donald Trump administration's immigration policies in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico on Jun 30, 2018. (File Photo: REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez)Surely the speed and scale of Chinaâ€™s ascent has contributed to this. But what is most important is the growing suspicion on the part of electorates that globalisation is an elite project that primarily benefits elites.Somehow branches for financial institutions in foreign countries seem to be a higher priority than protections for displaced workers. And protection of the intellectual property of global corporations is a more focal concern than preventing unfair competition from foreign companies that escape regulation.This must change if global integration is to maintain its political foundation in the worldâ€™s rich countries.KEEPING GLOBAL INTEGRATION INTACTPolitical leaders must connect global integration with tangible benefits for middle-class citizens, must show that international cooperation helps to prevent exploitation of ordinary citizens by elites, and must assure people that adequate social protections are in place so that those who must adjust to economic change are protected.In The Economic Consequences of the Peace, written after World War I, John Maynard Keynes asserted the primacy of economics, observing that:The perils of the future lie not in frontiers and sovereignties but in food, coal and transport.His call for strong policies directed at promoting mutual prosperity and cooperation went unheeded, with catastrophic consequences.The Berlin Wall which was put up to keep Western â€œfascistsâ€? from entering East Germany, stood until Nov 9, 1989 (Photo: AFP/GERARD MALIE)The understanding of this grim experience after World War II set the stage for the best 70 years mankind has enjoyed.Will the US and the global community turn away from the paradigm of global integration that has worked so well and move back to the narrow nationalism that Keynes so powerfully and rightfully decried? Or will they find ways of promoting global integration that benefit all citizens everywhere?These might include major cooperative efforts to prevent global corporations from avoiding taxes, crackdowns on regulatory arbitrage, and stronger domestic programmes to cushion the impact of structural changes on individual workers.These are the questions that may determine the history of the 21st century.Lawrence H Summers is a Harvard professor and former US Treasury secretary.

"BEIJING: Recent â€œradically differentâ€? trade measures by the United States have put pressure on its relations with China and other countries, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (Apr 8).In an interview with the Peopleâ€™s Daily as part of a working visit to China, Mr Lee said that while the US has been a longstanding advocate of free trade and economic multilateralism, it has recently taken specific steps to protect its domestic industries and reduce its large bilateral trade deficits.Advertisementâ€œGlobalisation and international trade have underpinned the growth and prosperity of many countries, including Singapore and China. But in some countries, the political mood is shifting against them,â€? Mr Lee said.â€œIf unilateral and tit-for-tat actions escalate into trade wars, the multilateral trading system that has brought countries prosperity for decades will be severely undermined. There will be no winners in a trade war,' he added.REGIONAL TRADEIn further comments in answer to a question about regional trade arrangements, Mr Lee noted that Chinaâ€™s economy has developed greatly since 2001 when it joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). Since then, China has committed to and benefitted from abiding by multilateral rules, including submitting to WTO dispute settlement mechanisms.AdvertisementAdvertisementâ€œChinaâ€™s share of global GDP and trade volume have also increased dramatically. It is therefore natural that other countries expect China to take on more commitments and contribute more to the global system, by further opening market access for trade in goods and services, and liberalising rules for foreign investments into China,â€? Mr Lee said.He added that these steps would better match Chinaâ€™s present stage of development. China can do so on a multilateral basis, or through free trade agreements (FTAs) with regional partners.Mr Lee highlighted the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which was renamed after the withdrawal of the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which is a proposed FTA spearheaded by the ten ASEAN member states and involving six major trading partners, including China.Mr Lee said that these two agreements will boost economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region and promote a seamless flow of goods, services and business that will benefit all countries.â€œThe CPTPP, which was recently signed, is an open and inclusive agreement. We welcome China, and others, to join the CPTPP when they are ready,â€? Mr Lee said.â€œWe also hope that the RCEP can be concluded soon. â€¦ If we can sign the RCEP this year, it will, together with the CPTPP, send a clear signal to the world about our commitment to multilateral trade, and our resolve to keep the regional architecture open and inclusive,â€? he added.Mr Leeâ€™s latest visit to China comes after its 19th Party Congress and â€œLianghuiâ€?, the annual meetings of the national legislature and the top political advisory meeting held last month.â€œThese meetings set strategic directions for Chinaâ€™s development and foreign policy in a new era. China will play a growing role in regional and global issues. Singapore will continue to support Chinaâ€™s constructive participation in the regional architecture as well as the international system,â€? Mr Lee said.He described the two countriesâ€™ relations as strong and that there has been â€œwin-win cooperationâ€? over a wide range of issues including trade and investment to social governance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In the tit-for-tat trade war between China and the United States, exacting an economic price, such as intended by imposing retaliatory tariffs, may not be enough. A critical battle is also being fought on the public relations front. If one of the belligerents can make a stronger case than the other, it could put greater pressure on the other party to de-escalate.This is apparently what the Chinese government intended to do with the publication of its 71-page (in English) white paper, â€œThe Facts and Chinaâ€™s Position on China-U.S. Trade Friction,â€? released on September 24, the day the new 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to the United States went into effect. Judging by its content, the Information Office of the State Council, the author of the report, did a better job than its previous PR efforts. The white paper provides sufficient detail to convince us of the benefits of globalization and U.S.-China trade relations. It also persuasively argues that the huge bilateral trade deficit the U.S. has with China is primarily the result of macroeconomic factors, such as low U.S. savings rates and high fiscal deficits, not trade barriers. But the white paper nevertheless falls short when it attempts to defend against criticism of Chinaâ€™s policies and practices on subsidies to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), government-directed industrial policy, foreign investment, intellectual property rights, and market access.While most knowledgeable people are sympathetic to Chinaâ€™s arguments on the economic benefits of trade, few are likely to accept Beijingâ€™s defense of its controversial economic policies and practices, such as subsidies to SOEs, restrictive access for foreign companies (mostly in the high value-added service sector), and weak intellectual property rights protection. These have been seized by the Trump administration as casus belli in initiating the trade war. Chinese leaders must know that nearly all Western business executives, most of them friendly toward China, also find these policies and practices harmful to their businesses.A smarter move on Beijingâ€™s part would have been to openly acknowledge Chinaâ€™s shortcomings in these areas but pledge to correct them with reforms. Some in the Chinese government may be concerned that doing so would legitimize Trumpâ€™s trade war, but such worries are superfluous. The reality Chinese leaders need to be aware of is that grievances against these Chinese policies and practices are widely shared in the West, not just in the U.S. or within the Trump administration. Many find Trumpâ€™s protectionist mindset and bullying tactics objectionable, but they agree that pressure is needed to force China to address these structural problems, which make free trade between China and the rest of the world untenable in the long run.The challenge facing Beijing now is what it should do to broker a ceasefire in the trade war.Up to this point, the Chinese government has been courting Western business leaders in the hope that they could persuade the Trump administration to back down. At the same time, Beijing also expects that its retaliation will cause enough economic pain in the U.S. to make Trump reverse course. Based on developments in recent months â€“ in particular Washingtonâ€™s decision to impose the latest tariffs on the eve of a planned visit by the chief Chinese negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He â€“ this is not a winning approach. The simple fact is that the trade hawks are in charge in the White House, while pragmatists are sidelined.Politically, it was impossible for China not to cancel Mr. Liuâ€™s visit. This outcome was almost certainly anticipated by the trade hawks, whose ultimate objective is a near-total economic decoupling of the two countries. Chinaâ€™s tit-for-tat tactics, complemented with an emerging PR campaign, will likely play into the hands of the trade hawks. They will easily persuade Trump, who is far more concerned with preserving his image as a tough guy than with the economic consequences of his decisions, to push back against China with maximum force. At the same time, Chinaâ€™s lack of credible commitment to addressing the underlying structural issues will also bolster the case of the trade hawks and discourage the business community, one of the real victims of the trade war, from stepping forward to end the carnage.Given its relative position of weakness in the trade war, Chinaâ€™s best course of action in the coming months is to seek a face-saving compromise that can preserve its commercial relationship with the U.S.On the diplomatic front, Beijing will need to re-engage with the U.S. before the newly-imposed tariffs rise to 25% on January 1, 2019. This will not be easy because the Trump administration is internally divided and, unless the political dynamics change dramatically, the trade hawks will continue to remain in the driverâ€™s seat, dimming any hopes of a negotiated solution.The Chinese government may be tempted to wait until after the mid-term elections in the U.S., hoping that Trump would rethink his tariff war after an expected drubbing at the polls. This is wishful thinking. The â€œget tough with Chinaâ€? policy has bipartisan support. A Democratic wave in the mid-term elections is unlikely to change the underlying political dynamics of the trade war in Washington. In this context, waiting is wasting valuable time.Instead, Beijing must be proactive. To shift the political dynamics in Washington in favor of the pragmatists, China must quickly regain the support of Americaâ€™s business community, which has been alienated by Chinaâ€™s failure to live up to its promises after it helped Beijing enter the World Trade Organization (WTO). If China makes credible promises on substantive market access and structural reforms that can be carried out quickly, its erstwhile allies in the U.S. business community will likely enter the fray from the sidelines.Such a step may appear to be too much of a compromise for many Chinese leaders, but this may be the only realistic measure to end the trade war before it totally wrecks U.S.-China trade (and geopolitical) relations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US president Donald Trump kept up pressure on trading partners on Saturday, threatening European automakers with a tax on imports if the European Union retaliates against his plan to slap tariffs on aluminum and steel.Trump's tweet suggested he is refusing to yield to US business interests and foreign trading partners alarmed at the prospect of a trade war that rattled financial markets this week.'If the EU wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on US companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the US,' Trump wrote on Twitter.'They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!'Reuters Cars for export stand in a parking area at a shipping terminal in the harbour of the northern German town of Bremerhaven.The United States imposes a 2.5-per cent tariff on cars assembled in Europe and a 25-per cent tariff on European-built vans and pickup trucks. Europe imposes a 10-per cent tariff on US-built cars.Trump criticised Europe in remarks at a fundraiser, according to video posted online Saturday, and suggested they would not increase tariffs.'The European Union: brutal. They've been brutal to us,' Trump said at a Florida fundraiser.'They've banded together in order to beat the United States in trade.'Trump did not respond to questions about tariffs or other topics upon returning to the White House Saturday.In a speech Friday night at Harvard University, European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager said the EU will respond to the tariffs 'to defend European industry, and the world trading system', according to a copy of her remarks. She called the Trump action'one-sided protectionist measures, which hurt, not just jobs, but the whole system of rules that makes our global economy work.'German automakers Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG build vehicles at plants in the United States. BMW employs more than 9,000 workers in South Carolina and is one of the state's largest employers.The United States accounts for about 15 per cent of worldwide Mercedes-Benz and BMW brand sales, while it accounts for five per cent of VW brand sales and 12 per cent of Audi sales.The United States had a $22.3 billion automotive vehicle and parts trade deficit with Germany in 2017 and a $7 billion deficit with the United Kingdom, according to US government data.Last year, Germany's automotive trade association said 'the United States would be shooting itself in the foot by imposing tariffs or other trade barriers'.Trump's threat comes amid mounting transatlantic tension on trade.On Thursday, Trump said the United States would apply duties of 25 per cent on imported steel and 10 per cent on aluminum to protect domestic producers.Major automakers say the move will raise the cost of cars and trucks.The next day, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told German television that, 'We will put tariffs on Harley-Davidson (motorcycles), on bourbon and on blue jeans â€“ Levis.'Canada also has said it will retaliate for any tariffs on steel and aluminum.Trump had tweeted on Friday that trade wars are good and 'easy to win', perturbing US financial markets.In January 2017, Trump warned German car companies he would impose a border tax of 35 per cent on vehicles imported to the US market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But they do tend to leave a lot of economic wreckage, often hurt the very people they're meant to help and can fracture diplomatic relations among allies.After announcing plans last week to slap taxes on imported aluminum and steel, President Donald Trump called trade wars â€œgoodâ€? and breezily forecast an â€œeasyâ€? victory for the United States.Economists see it rather differently. Starting a fight with trading partners has mostly proved to be self-defeating, they note.â€œUsually, all sides lose in a trade war,â€? says Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist and author of the just-published â€œClashing Over Commerce: A History of U.S. Trade Policy.â€? â€œTrade shrinks as countries pile on barriers in an effort to remedy some grievance, with consumers paying the price.â€?The term â€œtrade warâ€? is usually tossed around when countries spar over commerce, often without a clear sense of what it is. Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, defines it as a series of â€œescalating tit-for-tat trade barriers imposed on each other by two or more countries.â€?Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says the world hasn't endured a full-blown trade war since the 1930s. But globally, war drums are beating again.Europeans have threatened to retaliate against Trump's metals tariffs by targeting American blue jeans, bourbon and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. It may not be a coincidence that Harleys are produced in House Speaker Paul Ryan's Wisconsin and bourbon in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's Kentucky. Trump has met Europe's threat of retaliation with a piled-on threat of his own: To slap tariffs on European autos.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, which stands to suffer most from Trump's proposed steel and aluminum tariffs, warned that he was prepared to â€œdefend Canadian industryâ€? from the tariffs.China has responded to earlier Trump-imposed trade sanctions â€” tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines â€” by launching an anti-dumping investigation into U.S. sorghum exports, a move seen as a warning shot at American farmers who depend heavily on trade.China, after all, consumes a third of the soybeans American farmers produce. John Heisdorffer, president of the American Soybean Association, warned that a Chinese retaliation to Trump's tariffs â€œwould be devastating to U.S. soy growers. Our competitors in Brazil and Argentina are all too happy to pick up supplying the Chinese market.â€?Though full-blown trade wars are mostly destined to fail, countries can sometimes pressure their trading partners to change their ways, Alden says. With U.S. automakers reeling from Japanese competition in the 1980s, the Reagan administration strong-armed Japan into agreeing to â€œvoluntary export restraintsâ€? on car shipments. Japanese automakers ended up moving factories to the United States to avoid the limits.But shielding one domestic industry from foreign competition can hurt others by driving up prices. A study by NERA Economic Consulting found that a 7 percent aluminum tariff â€” less than what the administration is planning â€” would save 1,000 jobs annually in the aluminum industry but wipe out 22,600 other jobs across the U.S. economy.In 2002, President George W. Bush imposed tariffs on Chinese steel. The move allowed U.S. steel producers to increase prices, raising costs for companies that buy steel and pressuring them to cut back elsewhere. But the tariffs are thought to have cost significant U.S. job losses.Or consider the â€œRubber Chickenâ€? dispute of 2009. The Obama administration slapped tariffs on Chinese tires, charging that a surge in imports was hurting the U.S. tire industry. Beijing counterpunched: It imposed a tax of up to 105 percent on U.S. chicken feet â€” a throw-away item in the U.S. that's considered a delicacy in China. The Peterson Institute for International Economics calculated that the tariffs probably saved 1,200 American tire jobs â€” but consumers paid over $900,000 in higher tire prices for each job saved.To justify its proposed tariffs, the Trump administration invoked a section of U.S. law to declare that metals imports threatened America's industrial base and national security â€” even though the Pentagon says the military needs just 3 percent of U.S. aluminum and steel production.The administration â€œstretches the definition of a national security threat to the breaking point,â€? says Alden at the Council on Foreign Relations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"HONG KONG (CNNMoney) - China on Friday accused the United States of starting 'the biggest trade war in economic history' as the two sides imposed steep new tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of each other's exports.The Trump administration's 25% tariffs affect more than 800 Chinese products worth $34 billion such as industrial machinery, medical devices and auto parts. They kicked in just after midnight ET, which is noon in Beijing.China's tariffs on US goods came into effect immediately afterward, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Friday.Trump and his advisers argue the tariffs are necessary to pressure China into abandoning unfair practices such as stealing intellectual property and forcing American companies to hand over valuable technology.Beijing insists it's the injured party.'China is forced to strike back to safeguard core national interests and the interests of its people,' the Commerce Ministry said in a statement on Friday. It accused the United States of 'typical trade bullying.'The government said previously it would hit more than 500 US export items including cars and major agricultural goods such as soybeans and meat worth the same as the Chinese products targeted by the United States.Even before Friday, the trade dispute between the world's top two economies had rattled markets and prompted warnings from companies of damage to their bottom lines and higher prices for consumers.American companies doing business in China are particularly worried.'Increased tensions in the US-China economic relationship will negatively impact ... operations in China,' William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said in a statement Friday.Trump threatens another $500 billionThe big question is how far the hostilities between Washington and Beijing will go.The United States is also set to impose 25% tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese exports later in the summer, and China has vowed to retaliate against US goods worth a similar amount.Economists say that if the back-and-forth stops there, the overall impact on both economies will be minimal even though some industries will suffer.But Trump has said his administration will respond to retaliation from Beijing with much bigger waves of tariffs, raising the prospect of worsening tit-for-tat reprisals. On Thursday, he suggested the possibility of tariffs on almost $500 billion more of Chinese goods.He described the potential escalation to reporters aboard Air Force One: 'Thirty-four, and then you have another 16 in two weeks and then, as you know, we have 200 billion in abeyance and then after the 200 billion we have 300 billion in abeyance. OK?' Trump said. 'So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300.'That amount is higher than an earlier threat from Trump to target as much as $450 billion of Chinese exports. It's also bigger than the $506 billion of goods that the United States imported from China last year.'We urge the two governments to come back to the negotiation table with the aim of having productive discussions based on achieving results -- focused on fairness and reciprocal treatment -- instead of escalating the current situation,' said Zarit of the American Chamber of Commerce.Underpinning the dispute is Trump's anger at America's $376 billion deficit in goods trade with China.Despite three rounds of negotiations between the two sides, including a Chinese pledge to significantly increase purchases of American products, Trump decided to go ahead with the tariffs.The clash with China comes as the Trump administration is also fighting over trade with American allies such as Canada and the European Union. US tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have provoked retaliatory measures against billions of dollars of American exports. Trump has added to the tension by threatening new tariffs on cars.For the time being, analysts say it's hard to see Washington or Beijing backing down in the dispute.'By threatening unilateral action without having any allies and not reducing domestic discord on trade, the Trump administration has invited China to stand tough,' said Scott Kennedy, director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.'The Trump administration also believes that at least starting a trade war is in its interests; the US economy is strong enough to endure a crimp in trade, the president's domestic political standing is as strong as ever amongst Republicans, and pushing China hard on trade may help restore US credibility on other issues,' he added.Reaching a deal will be toughThe two giant economies appear ready to see which side can endure the most pain. The damage could also spread to other economies, hurting business confidence and prompting companies to delay investments.Kennedy say he thinks the Trump administration's enthusiasm for the conflict 'will erode as the economic pain and political fallout from a trade war begin to take hold. At that point, the US will be more interested in negotiations, and the Chinese side will also want to come to the table.'But reaching a deal that's palatable to both sides will be tough. For example, the US government wants China to rein in government subsidies for policies like 'Made in China 2025,' which seeks to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into industries such as robotics, electric cars and computer chips with the aim of becoming a global leader.Analysts say China is unlikely to budge on those plans, which it sees as crucial for developing its huge economy.'It's still hard for me to believe the Trump administration could develop and negotiate an overarching package with China that genuinely sticks,' Kennedy said. 'And so I'd expect the two sides to pursue some sort of face-saving deal that looks good on paper but is not enduring.'-- Steven Jiang and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.Copyright 2018 by CNN NewSource.

"Seeking to calm concerns about his plans to slap tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, President Donald Trump on Friday expressed confidence that he can 'win' a global trade war.But as with any war, there would be casualties. And exporters in some industries and regions of the country would be hit harder than others.A lot depends on where those exports are sold. West Coast states rely more heavily on Chinese markets. Border states generate some of the biggest demand from Canada and Mexico. New Mexico, for example, sends 45 percent of its exports south of the border. Michigan sells more than 40 percent of its exports to Canada.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The CEO of Standard Chartered said tariffs could be an 'effective' opening gambit for trade negotiations, but ultimately would provide a negative if there were escalating tensions between China and the U.S.'I think if there is really a sense that you can win a trade war, that will be more concerning,' Bill Winters told CNBC when asked about the new tariffs from the U.S. administration. 'Because I think the only thing that's clear is, as you ratchet up tariffs and other levels of protectionism, globally you lose.'Earlier this month, President Donald Trump announced steel and aluminum tariffs that upset traditional allies, such as Japan and the European Union. Both are trying to be excluded from the new metal tariffs but it is still unclear whether this will happen.Meanwhile, Investors are monitoring an investigation into intellectual property rights in the U.S. fearing that its outcome will spark a trade war with China. The result of such a probe could find that China caused losses in the billions of dollars for the U.S. economy due to counterfeit goods and pirated software. As a result, Trump could reportedly announce new tariffs on Chinese imports as high as $60 billion.'The tariff talk, the protectionism more broadly, of course, is a concern,' Winter told CNBC. 'We can hope that the policymakers on both sides (China and the U.S.) are able to come to terms because both have said that a trade war is a bad thing, no one wins a trade war â€¦ I am pretty sure you can't win a trade war,' Winters told CNBC at a conference in Asia.According to research from Citigroup on Monday, the recent trade actions by the U.S. administration increase the risks of a full-scale trade war. Analysts at the bank expect a 'tightening in trade and investment rules with only modest macroeconomic consequences' but they also said that if tensions escalate into a trade war: 'It would have stagflationary effects on the global outlook.'A great deal of Standard Chartered business takes place in Asia, but Winters said the bank is 'not very exposed to a ramping up of the protectionism between those two parties.'If both countries entered into a trade war, Chinese firms would find other markets where they can sell their products they are currently selling to the United States, as well as finding other areas where they can buy the products they are now buying from the U.S., Winters said. He argued that it 'actually plays to our strengths.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'It's a tax on American consumers because a lot of the product they're buying will cost more and it hurts American industries when countries retaliate.'The group has also expressed its concerns directly with the White House.Charles and David Koch, the leaders of Koch Industries, one of the largest private corporations in the world, exert vast political power and influence on the right for an array of pet conservative issues, such as tax cuts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tariff negotiations with China have not started, though the White House hopes they will bear some fruit and prevent a trade war, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Friday.'They have not really begun yet,' Kudlow, President Donald Trump's chief economic advisor, told Bloomberg Television. 'China's response to our complaints ... has been unsatisfactory.'Markets were on edge again after the Trump administration announced Thursday night it was exploring another package of tariffs against Chinese goods.However, Kudlow stressed that no new duties have been implemented, and talks with the Chinese will continue for several months before anything is done. He said there is always an open line of communication with China, but no formal tariff talks have begun.'This is a moderate, tempered approach that we are taking,' he said. 'This is not a trade war.'Earlier in the week, Kudlow's comments insisting that the U.S. is not looking to provoke a major confrontation with China helped sooth a jittery market that staged a 700-point swing Wednesday in the Dow industrials.He reiterated Friday the U.S. concern over China stealing U.S. intellectual property, particularly in technology.'There's no secret here. They've got enormous trade and tariff barriers,' he said. 'They've got to stop their stealing of the intellectual property that we try to use in any company around the world. Those are good places to start.'Kudlow, a fomer CNBC special contributor, succeeded Gary Cohn as Trump's top economic advisor.

"The Trump administration's trade dispute with China may have quieted down, but CNBC's Jim Cramer argued on Thursday that it is far from over.'We've opened up a new front in the trade war, and while it's quieter than all of the bombast about tariffs that had people freaking out, there are still a ton of companies that can get hurt here,' the 'Mad Money' host said. 'The new front in the trade war? Technology.'The U.S. Commerce Department's Monday ban on selling U.S. products to Chinese smartphone maker ZTE was 'just the tip of the iceberg,' Cramer said.Early on Thursday, China hit back, citing antitrust concerns in Qualcomm's proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors.'I think it's pretty transparent. It's attempt to retaliate for the actions our government took earlier this week,' Cramer said. 'This deal has been approved by every other relevant antitrust agency on earth.'With shares of Qualcomm and NXP down over 4 and 5 percent respectively after the ruling, Cramer credited Chinese officials for hitting U.S. companies where it hurt â€” in the stock market.'From a legal perspective, this is one of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen, but from a geopolitical perspective, it's a smart move â€” the Chinese know how to play hardball,' he said.Still, Cramer worried about how the tit-for-tat battle could affect the rest of the technology sector now that the focus is squarely on hitting tech where it hurts.U.S. regulatory agencies can keep chipping away at Chinese companies, but two can play at that game, the 'Mad Money' host said.'If this is the new normal, if the Chinese will block any semiconductor merger, that's going to be brutal for the stocks in the group,' he said. 'It makes the whole cohort less valuable.'But in addition to negative merger reviews, telecom tensions, and restrictions on exports, China had one key strategy that Cramer was particularly concerned about: boycotts.'The Chinese government loves to organize boycotts,' Cramer said, adding that past tensions with Japan and South Korea have led to Chinese boycotts of Japanese and South Korean products.'As I see it, this is China's ultimate weapon,' the 'Mad Money' host said.President Trump could tell U.S. consumers not to buy Chinese goods, but in a democracy, no one has to listen. But Cramer noted that China's government wields more power.'Do you really want to be the one guy breaking a boycott in an authoritarian communist state? I didn't think so,' Cramer quipped.Cramer added that the boycott option threatens more than just tech companies. In the past, bad publicity around KFC led to protests that hurt Yum China's business.'Here's the bottom line: just because we're not talking about tariffs every day, that doesn't mean our trade dispute with China is somehow over,' the 'Mad Money' host said. 'It's still very active, it's hot, it's just that the action has shifted to the tech front for the moment. You need to watch this very carefully or else you might end up like the shareholders in Acacia or Oclaro or NXP Semi or Qualcomm.

"The cause for worry is the 'war' on technology, not trade: DBS 12:29 AM ET Fri, 13 July 2018 | 08:25The proposed U.S. tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods would hit the worldâ€™s second-largest economy more severely than the previous custom duties did, according to the chief executive of Southeast Asiaâ€™s largest bank.Thatâ€™s because the latest list of targeted Chinese goods includes a greater number of finished products, which can be replaced by similar ones from other sources, Piyush Gupta, the CEO of Singaporeâ€™s DBS Bank, said on Friday.The Trump administration on Tuesday said it plans to impose 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods, which include refrigerators, electronics, cotton and auto parts. The tariffs will undergo a two-month review process, with hearings in August.Those tariffs, if implemented, â€œmight start biting a little bit more in terms of the volume of tradeâ€? compared to the levies on $34 billion in Chinese goods that came into effect on July 6, Gupta told CNBCâ€™s Martin Soong at the DBS Asian Insights Conference in Singapore.Impact from the earlier round of U.S. tariffs on the Chinese economy may be limited as there arenâ€™t many alternatives to those affected goods, he said.â€œI think most of these relate to components mostly in the mobile phone and the personal computer supply chain. I think alternate sources of supply are limited,â€? the CEO said.â€œThe total impact is probably price increases of magnitude of 5 to 10 percent, my own sense is these will be passed on to the end consumer or perhaps absorbed by the supply chain. I donâ€™t think these will reduce Chinaâ€™s export volume anytime soon.

"US and China both need each other, says China expert 11:30 AM ET Thu, 26 July 2018 | 06:28Qualcomm's termination of its proposed acquisition of rival chipmaker NXP reveals China has plenty of options in its trade war with the U.S., Yale economist Stephen Roach told CNBC on Thursday.'It's a reminder that trade wars are maybe not that easy to win,' Roach, a senior fellow at Yale and former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, said in a 'Squawk Box' interview. 'And China has a lot of ammunition up its sleeve.'Qualcomm officially terminated the deal to buy NXP after failing to get a decision from regulators in China by its deadline. It will proceed with a $30 billion stock buyback program that the chipmaker had previously said it would implement if it failed to complete the NXP deal.The deal had been held up by Chinese regulators amid a growing trade conflict between the U.S. and the Asian country. The U.S. and China both instituted tariffs on the other country's goods.China denied any link between the scrapped deal and the trade war.Roach urged the Trump administration to understand that the U.S. and China 'need each other,' saying low-price Chinese imports are needed to 'make ends meet' for cash-strapped Americans.'The Trump administration is clearly focused on isolating China, putting more pressure on China,' he said.American farmers are among the hardest hit by China's 25 percent retaliatory duties on everything from meats and dairy to fruits and vegetables to rice and soybeans.The Trump administration unveiled a plan this week to offer billions in aid to farmers hit by tariffs, which was quickly condemned by some Republican senators.Roach said the plan isn't a great strategy, adding it's like 'tying one arm behind your back and you use your foot to kick the ball down the field. It's not the best way to make progress on this front.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It rendered oranges in affected groves inedible, resulting in a 55 percent decline in production over the next decade. In response, Florida's orange growers raised OJ prices by nearly $2 per gallon, causing bottlers to turn to cheaper Brazilian OJ.Today, more than 50 percent of all orange juice bottled by major companies like Tropicana is supplied by a Brazilian company, shipped in specialized fruit juice tankers from the Port of Santos in Sao Paulo. In 2017, this OJ export market was worth $1.4 billion. Brazilian orange juice companies used this cash influx to come into the U.S. and buy out Florida's production facilities, making Brazil a financial backer of much of America's orange juice.However, cheaper Brazilian orange juice has some serious costs. One 2015 report from activist organization Supply Cha!nge called the orange picking industry in Brazil 'a modern system of slavery.' Workers are sometimes unpaid for weeks and trapped in employment contracts that keep them in debt and stuck on the plantation, the report says.The report also alleges that high pesticide use leads to unsafe working conditions and even death. Supply Cha!nge claims the orange juice produced under these conditions ends up in Simply Orange, Tropicana and Minute Maid bottles.CNBC reached out to several top exporters of Brazilian OJ â€” Citrosuco, Cutrale and Louis Dreyfus Co. â€” and two major retailers of OJ in the U.S. â€” Coca-Cola and PepsiCo â€” for comments on the report's claims.Citrosuco told CNBC 'it does not recognize any working condition analogous to slavery in its relations and emphasizes that it does not agree with such practices. The company ensures that it strictly complies with the labor legislation regarding all its employees.'Cutrale said in a statement to CNBC that it 'strives to be totally compliant with the labor and environmental laws everywhere it operates. All of our more than 18,000 workers earn salaries above minimum wage by law, have weekly rest days, receive robust training and are provided with appropriate safety equipment.'Louis Dreyfus Co. did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.Coca-Cola, which owns Simply Orange and Minute Maid, has not responded to CNBC's request for comment. But the company was quoted in the Supply Cha!nge report as saying that it does 'not tolerate the practices documented in this study. Although Coca-Cola regularly audits and controls the juice companies and the plantations they own directly, this does not include subcontractors.'Pepsico, which owns Tropicana, did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.Recently, President Donald Trump's tariffs and trade war have provoked the EU, Canada and China to impose an import tax on U.S. orange juice. While American exports of OJ have fallen 60 percent in the last five years, tariffs from some of its largest trading partners could kill America's export industry, increase reliance on Brazil and raise OJ prices for Americans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US and China trade tensions more of a political issue, expert says 1:49 AM ET Mon, 10 Sept 2018 | 03:01The growing U.S.-China trade war may well push the world's second-largest economy to work toward winning even more global clout, according to an economist at a widely followed investment group.In fact, Eric Fishwick, head of economic research at CLSA, said the ongoing trade tussle between Washington and Beijing could actually push China to shore up both its economy and its geopolitical positioning.'It may well have the perverse reaction of accelerating China's attempts to move up the supply curve ... to become self-sufficient (in) more and more high-tech products. And it will certainly encourage China in its moves to build more and more political and economic spheres of influence,' he told CNBC's Akiko Fujita at the 2018 CLSA Investors' Forum in Hong Kong.He pointed to the country's mammoth Belt and Road Initiative â€” an infrastructure and investment program widely seen as an attempt by China to construct a massive, multi-national zone of economic and political influence that has Beijing at its center.On the economic development front, China has been on a mission to move toward high-tech industries, with its Made in China 2025 plan seeking to establish manufacturing strength in areas such as robotics and electric vehicles. The strategy aims to move the country beyond fabricating and exporting basic goods such as clothing and consumer electronics.As for the origins of the trade war, Fishwick said politics played an important role. The ongoing negotiations were kicked off, he said, partly due to the U.S. becoming uncomfortable with China's growing power.'This is really because China is the next geo-economic and geopolitical rival to the U.S., and the U.S. is uncomfortable with that,' he said. 'I do not believe that either side will particularly (be) willing to compromise given that it's more a political issue rather than simply a trade issue.'Fears of trade tensions escalating rose on Friday when U.S. President Donald Trump warned he was ready to impose tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese goods, on top of the $200 billion in duties that he had already threatened to slap on China.China's trade surplus with the U.S. widened to a record in August, even as the country's export growth slowed slightly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A policy debate in China on how best to address slowing growth deepened on Friday, as analysts urged authorities to boost fiscal stimulus amid rising risks to the world's second-biggest economy from a bitter trade conflict with the United States.An article in Financial News, which is run by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), quoted analysts as calling for an adjustment to fiscal policy and some loosening of financial regulations, saying monetary policy would not be able to resolve corporate funding challenges on its own.The article cited CITIC Securities fixed income analyst Ming Ming as saying that maximizing effectiveness of monetary policy requires active coordination with fiscal and regulatory policies.'There is still a lot of room for fiscal policy' support, and policymakers should focus on the 'strength and rhythm' of regulations, 'fully considering the impact on market expectations', Ming said.As China's economic growth slows, it has sparked a debate among government researchers on whether fiscal policy should help to soften the impact of a trade war with the United States. Both countries have already slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on each other's goods and with no signs of easing in tensions Beijing has already started to loosen monetary conditions.Overall credit growth has slowed in China this year, with off-balance sheet lending, or shadow banking, contracting amid a crackdown on financial risks.But Friday's article said the latest data showed bank lending was not making up for the gap in credit due to shrinking off-balance sheet lending.'The central bank's targeted policies are difficult to realize in practice... it is not useful to release liquidity alone. The money flows into some parts of the system and does not flow out,' said a regulatory official, who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity.Bank executives, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that a lack of clarity on new financial market policies is holding up lending to firms.Policy Priorities ShiftThe economy is starting to feel the pinch from a multi-year crackdown on riskier lending and debt, problems which were fuelled in part by a massive stimulus programme to support the economy during the global financial crisis.The regulatory tightening has driven up corporate borrowing costs, prompting the PBOC to cut banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) three times this year.The central bank overseas monetary policy while the finance ministry supervises fiscal policy. It is unclear whether the current debate reflects the policy stances of the two agencies.Research firm Capital Economics said that China's Ministry of Finance will loosen policy as pressure mounts due to a slowing economy.'If nothing else, the recent debate suggests that officials agree on the need for policy loosening, even if they disagree about the exact form that it should take,' Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note.'This highlights how far policy priorities have shifted since the start of the year, when the deleveraging campaign was still at the top of the political agenda.'Chen Jianheng, a fixed income analyst at China International Capital Corporation, said the strength of financial regulations can be moderately adjusted, according to the article.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(CNN) The world loves America's nuts. The United States is the largest producer and exporter of tree nuts such as almonds, walnuts and pecans. That's why international trade is so vital to this industry.It's also why the hefty retaliatory tariffs that China has imposed and the onesIndia is threatening to levy have left many growers uncertain about their next steps. Sales are faltering, prompting some growers to hold off on buying new equipment and others to halt plans to plant more trees.The trade war is hurting California, in particular, since that's where many tree nuts grow.The Golden State produces more than 80% of the world's almonds and exports 70% of them, according to the Almond Board of California. This year is expected to be a record crop of 2.45 billion pounds.The board has spent more than two decades building its trading relationship with China, which represents a $600 million business, said Richard Waycott, the industry group's CEO. Some 9% of US almonds wind up in China.China, however, has raised tariffs on America's nuts twice in recent months in retaliation for President Donald Trump's hikes on the tariffs on aluminum and steel the country ships to the United States. Almonds now carry a levy of 50%, up from 10% earlier this year.This has led to a decline in shipments in May and June, compared to last year, Waycott said. Also, commitments for new crops â€” which have been sold, but not yet shipped â€” were 'down considerably' in May, June and July, compared to last year.'We have a lot of additional production coming on and certainly don't need trade problems in an environment like that,' said Waycott, who says he has also heard anecdotal reports of price drops.Stuart Woolf is confident that he'll be able to sell all of the roughly 20 million pounds of almonds he grows at Woolf Farming Company in Fresno, California. However, he isn't shipping as much of his crop to China, shifting instead to other destinations. This is a step in the wrong direction, he says.'China's growing economy and growing middle class has really driven almond consumption,' Woolf said. 'It's a huge target market for our industry that's now being put at risk'Growers of tree nuts, including pistachios, are suffering under China's retaliatory tariffs.Woolf also grows pistachios, and he's more concerned about the impact of Chinese tariffs on that crop since the United States faces more competition there. China raised the tariff on that nut to 45%, up from 5%.His friends in the pistachio processing industry, who sell the nuts on behalf of growers, say they haven't sold any to China this year. That's a major change from this point last year, when they had sold around 100 million pounds, or roughly half the total for the year.All of this is leading Woolf to think twice about expanding his groves.'I'm pumping the brakes on planting new pistachio and almond orchards until we see how this shakes out,' he said.Other growers are looking to expand into new markets.R.G. Lamar may delay buying equipment for his pecan farm because of China's tariffs.R.G. Lamar operates one of the largest pecan farms in Georgia with 2,300 acres of trees. He sells 60% of his crop to China, but is now looking to diversify more since tariffs on pecans jumped to 47%, up from 7% earlier this year.Aware that much of his farm is dependent on trade with one country, Lamar created a snack business, Front Porch Pecans, a few years ago. Now, he'll focus more on growing this domestic consumer segment, especially since demand is up.Long term, he thinks it will be better to have a more diversified business. But, it's not a simple switch.'It's not cheap to completely change your marketing strategy and try to develop a new market,' Lamar said. 'All that takes resources and it may not work. There's uncertainty in that, too.'The Trump administration is aware that its global trade wars are hurting the American agriculture industry. Last month, officials announced they would provide up to $12 billion in aid to certain farmers and ranchers, including sending them money and purchasing excess inventory.Woolf, however, said the measure won't help him much. The tree nut industry isn't eligible for the payments the federal government plans to dole out, and growers produce too much to send to food banks and other nutrition programs.'I don't think they could buy enough to make a difference,' he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the trade war between China and the United States increase, exporters from India, particularly of Soybean meal, are availing opportunities to trade with neighbouring country China.In this regard, recently, many Soybean processing plants in India were inspected by concerned authorities such as the Export Inspection Council India, for preparedness to avail export opportunities to China.Chinese authorities had banned the import of Soybean meal from India on the basis of non-compliance with food safety norms from last six years.However, after the US-China trade war escalating into a major conflict, China is eyeing on other countries, including India, to source its requirements. In fact, Chinese authorities recently visited Rice plants in India for the same reason.While the visit by the Chinese authorities has still not been confirmed, experts have opined that if indeed that happened, India could emerge as a big source for Soybean meal supplies to China, which is aggressively looking for a reliable supplier to fulfill its domestic demand in the absence of US exports, which accounted for almost half the Chinese demand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the United States, the cosmetics and personal care industry accounts for nearly $23bn of gross domestic product, and supports 3.6m domestic jobs. Cosmetics manufacturers export roughly $3bn annually to the European Union alone, much of which includes products manufactured in the United States by European-owned companies.In retaliation for the imposition of tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from the European Union and Canada â€“ imports that the Trump Administration claims threaten national security â€“ these trading partners retaliated by vowing to seek compensation in the form of tariffs on certain products â€œoriginating in the United States.â€? The European Unionâ€™s and Canadaâ€™s tariffs include cosmetic and personal care preparations. Specifically, in the European Union, powders, eye makeup, and nail products are now subject to a 25% tariff. In Canada, over $300m of pre-shave and aftershave, body wash, nail products, and hair lacquers are subject to a 10% tariff.Originating in the United States ?It is unclear exactly how the criterion â€œoriginating in the United Statesâ€? is applied, but customs law principles provide that a product â€œoriginatesâ€? from a certain territory if it has been wholly manufactured or â€œlastly substantially transformedâ€? in that territory. Acts of substantial transformation typically go beyond labelling, packaging, or affixing the logo on a product. Rather, â€œsubstantial transformationâ€? denotes a process or operation imparting to a product certain new characteristics or properties. For example, compounding sub-formulas or adding fragrance might qualify a product as â€œsubstantially transformedâ€?. Practically speaking, if the last substantial transformation occurs in production facilities within the United States, applicable tariffs will be levied upon export.It may be tempting to view the imposition of tariffs as an opportunity for native European and Canadian manufacturers to replace sales of products originating in the United States. It is, however, shortsighted to regard tariffs as a boon to cosmetics and personal care companies in Europe or Canada, particularly given larger companiesâ€™ global supply chain.Inside and outside the United States?As a spokesperson for industry group Cosmetics Europe said, â€œit is important to recall that many North American brands of cosmetic and personal care products belong to European and historical companies.â€?? Indeed, a Cosmetics Europe survey shows that in excess of 67% of United Statesâ€™ cosmetics exports targeted benefit European Union companies, who either own the exporting brands or, to a lesser degree, outsource manufacturing. Therefore, sanctioning imports of cosmetic products to the European Union could well have detrimental effects on European companies, including harming jobs and growth globally.Were companies to shift consumer focus to tariff-free European and Canadian manufactured products, the United States cosmetics and personal care industry would be negatively hit, over time weakening manufacturing and eventually costing American workers vital employment. Particularly susceptible may be price-sensitive independent companies seeking to establish an overseas presence.Whatâ€™s next??As it stands, representatives from the European Union and United States have suggested â€œdiscussingâ€? and potentially easing steel and aluminum tariffs, though the Trump Administration has given no indication of backing down from its protectionist perch generally, and the specter of cosmetics and personal care companies caught in the middle of a protracted trade war is real. Unfortunately, there is little to do at the moment but lobby governments both inside and outside the United States, and comply with the regulations imposing tariffs.The US tariffs issue is ongoing.

"Trump threatens expansive tariffsWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump threatened Monday to levy tariffs on nearly all of China's products shipped to the United States unless Beijing agrees to a host of sweeping trade concessions, a dramatic escalation that would enlist American consumers in the brewing U.S.-China commercial conflict.In a statement, Trump said he had ordered his chief negotiator, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, to draw up a list of $200 billion in Chinese products that will be hit with tariffs of 10 percent if China refuses his demands to narrow the yawning U.S. trade deficit and change its industrial policies.The president warned that he was prepared to hit China with an additional $200 billion in import taxes unless Beijing capitulates.Such a step would be virtually unprecedented in U.S. history and would put nearly all of the $505 billion in products that the United States imports from China under tariffs.'The trade relationship between the United States and China must be much more equitable,' Trump said. 'The United States will no longer be taken advantage of on trade by China and other countries in the world.'The president is adopting an increasingly aggressive posture in seeking to implement his 'America First' trade strategy. He has threatened or imposed tariffs on all major U.S. trading partners, including China, the European Union, Mexico and Canada, in a high-stakes bid to reshape global trade in a way that reopens shuttered American factories.Trump's latest threat - if implemented - would dramatically expand the goods facing trade measures to a range of consumer items, forcing Americans to pay more for smartphones, computers, toys, televisions and just about every other middle-class staple.None of the tariffs announced Monday will take effect until industries and consumers have a chance to make their views known in a 60-day public comment period.'This is a threat that the Chinese can't match,' said Jeff Moon, a former U.S. trade negotiator. 'I see this as a major growl to get the Chinese to take his threats seriously.'Rick Helfenbein, president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, called the president's decision to up the ante 'hollow, vindictive and reckless' and said it would endanger the $130 billion in American exports to China.Administration officials believe they have the upper hand in any trade dispute with China, thanks to the larger $20 trillion U.S. economy. Since almost every American who wants work can find it, officials such as Kevin Hassett, head of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, say that the United States is positioned to withstand any trade war costs.Others warned that the president could stumble into a costly economic debacle.'I think Trump is completely misreading the Chinese,' said Phil Levy, who an economist who served in the George W. Bush White House. 'No one who followed China closely thought a direct public threat was going to get them to change. China is fixated on appearing strong.'The latest move came three days after Trump imposed tariffs of 25 percent on $50 billion in Chinese imports, an action aimed at compelling Beijing to change a range of industrial policies that the administration says disadvantage foreign companies. The United States complains that China forces foreign companies to surrender their technology in return for the right to operate in China and engages in cybertheft to acquire trade secrets.China hit back with tariffs on $50 billion in American products, including agricultural goods.'This latest action by China clearly indicates its determination to keep the United States at a permanent and unfair disadvantage, which is reflected in our massive $376 billion trade imbalance in goods,' the president said in the statement, released by the White House at around 7:30 p.m.Trump doubled his April threat to respond to any Chinese retaliation for his trade actions with $100 billion in additional tariffs. And he vowed to levy tariffs on a further $200 billion in Chinese goods if Beijing hit back against Monday's action.Trump has signaled an interest in using tariff threats to force trading partners to the negotiating table. Lighthizer employed similar tactics in the 1980s while leading American negotiators in talks with the Japanese.But early rounds between the United States and China have made little progress, beyond a now-withdrawn Chinese offer to buy more American goods. That's something that would cheer U.S. businesses and farmers but do little to resolve the structural forces that concern administration hard-liners. They say China seeks to acquire American technology via licit and illicit means to dominate industries of the future, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous vehicles and quantum computing.Trump's latest move seems to indicate that discussions between the two sides have fizzled, according to Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute. 'There is some sort of fundamental breakdown in communication,' Scissors said. 'From Trump's standpoint, the Chinese are basically flipping off the U.S. president.'Monday night's directive was the most expansive to date in a fast-escalating trade dispute between the world's biggest economies that has rattled business leaders and Republicans in Congress.The White House appeared headed for a showdown with Congress on Monday after the Senate passed legislation to reinstate a ban on the sale of U.S. components to the Chinese telecom giant ZTE.The measure, part of the annual defense appropriations bill, which passed 85 to 10, ordered the reimposition of the punitive measures imposed on ZTE after the company pleaded guilty to violating U.S. sanctions against North Korea and Iran.Trump had sought to roll back the measures last month as part of a deal with Chinese government leaders, arguing that the punishment against ZTE risked putting the company out of business.But several lawmakers - including some of the president's close allies - remain concerned that ZTE's products pose a significant national security risk and could be used by the Chinese government to spy on the United States.Senate leaders decided last week to include language written by two Republicans, Sens. Tom Cotton, Ark., and Marco Rubio, Fla., who along with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., offered the measure to reimpose punitive measures against ZTE in an updated version of the defense bill.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has made multiple trips to the Capitol in the meantime to plead the administration's case with House and Senate Republicans, in the hopes of getting lawmakers to drop the provision during the upcoming conference process, in which House and Senate negotiators will try to hammer out a compromise defense bill that can pass both chambers.Trump's escalation is probably a response to Senate fears that he has been too soft on China in the ZTE case, said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.'He needs to persuade Republican senators that he is being tougher than anyone and can get China to give up more than ever if he's given a free hand to negotiate,' he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Paola Loriggio, The Canadian PressTORONTO -- Ontario's threat of a trade war with U.S. states that adopt Buy American policies sparked swift criticism Wednesday from the opposition, who called it nothing but a 'reckless' political gambit from the governing Liberals as they fight to stay in power.Premier Kathleen Wynne announced Tuesday night that her cabinet would soon table legislation that would reduce procurement opportunities for states that pass Buy American laws by allowing provincial officials to write regulations targeting individual states.The opposition parties saw the move as a Liberal attempt to avoid responsibility for domestic problems.'Initiating a trade war with the United States is a last-ditch election ploy by Kathleen Wynne to deflect the blame for her disastrous economic policies,' said Progressive Conservative interim leader Vic Fedeli.The Liberals are responsible for the province losing its competitive advantage, he said, and their latest plan is just an attempt to deflect the blame ahead of a spring election.'The premier using this as a political tool to cling to power is nothing short of reckless, especially during this critical time in the NAFTA negotiations.'Fedeli said his party would review and consider the Liberal bill when it is put forward after the legislature resumes sitting later this month.Ontario's New Democrats also criticized the proposed legislation, saying the premier is simply 'grandstanding' before the election.The Liberals fired back Wednesday, saying the government began working on the issue more than a year ago.'If the actions that Premier Wynne has taken over the last year are connected to any election at all, it's the results of the U.S. election in 2016, which demanded elevated attention to the U.S. and to Ontario's trading relationship with U.S. states,' said Steven Del Duca, the minister of economic development and growth.Wynne also defended the plan, tweeting 'when jobs and opportunities for Ontario workers are threatened, we will always respond.'Speaking about the upcoming legislation in Washington, she said the size of each punishment will be proportional to the size of the Buy American exclusion to avoid setting off escalating reprisals.The move, she said, was inspired by a recent infrastructure bill from the state of New York, which passed in December and takes effect in April, just a month before the provincial election campaign begins.'I don't want a trade war,' she said Tuesday during an interview with The Canadian Press. 'But we have to stand up for Ontario businesses, and Ontario workers, and do that in a proportional way ... We are not going to roll over.'The Liberals' announcement is unlikely to sway voters, despite what the opposition parties might argue, said Wayne Petrozzi, a political science expert at Toronto's Ryerson University.'I think it's largely symbolic, even should they pass such a bill,' he said. 'In the past, we've not been terribly successful at getting ourselves any of kind of special dispensation when it comes to Buy American policies and it's hard to figure how that may be different this time.'What's more, he said, 'most Canadians don't concern themselves with that kind of ... minutiae of trade discussions, trade negotiations, trade issues.'New York legislators had initially proposed Buy American provisions in their budget that would restrict Ontario businesses' ability to bid on public sector procurement projects, but dropped the measures under pressure from Canadian officials. Provisions slated to take effect this spring are part of a less stringent bill that was brought forward later.More than $1 billion in goods are traded between Ontario and the U.S. each day, according to the province.The state of New York exported almost US$11 billion in goods to Ontario in 2016, it said. The province is ranked the first or second export destination for 28 states, the government said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The gung-ho attitude of President Trump is that the USA would welcome trade wars with various (if not all) trading partners because for decades the US has had the short end of the stick in all its international trade deals (Brexiters beware!). Many would dispute this, not least because the USA as the worldâ€™s largest economy has had more economic clout than any of its trading partners and can press for arrangements which suit the USA. Mr Trump, stable genius and business colossus doesnâ€™t see it this way. In his opinion, American trading might means that any trade war will be resolved in US favour and consequently, the US economy will be the winner. This is a simplistic view by any measure.The World Trade Organisation (WTO) does not share Mr Trumpâ€™s view. They have cautioned that a US-China trade war could have severe impacts on the global economy, beyond the two main protagonists. Current US plans would see tariffs worth $50 billion applied to some Chinese imports with China set to retaliate against US exports.Speaking on the BBCâ€™s Hard Talk programme, Roberto Azevedo, WTO director-general, suggested that a trade war could cause a rapid decline in global trade. 'If it's just limited to steel and aluminium, it's one thing. If you're talking about hundreds and thousands of products, it's a completely different thing. And the impact will be significantly different. I don't think anybody believes that this is something minor, even in the US administration. These conversations are ongoing precisely because people are beginning to understand, I hope, how serious this is and the kind of impact this could have to the global economy.'There is cautious optimism in the US that China and the USA will be able to come to an arrangement before matters escalate, but the US has lodged a complaint with WTO over intellectual property right violations that it believes China is guilty of. Mr Trump is a critic of WTO, having described it as a â€œdisasterâ€? and a â€œcatastropheâ€? for the US.Washington has also has launched a complaint against China for breaking basic patent rights rules at the WTO - a body that Mr Trump has said is a 'catastrophe' and 'a disaster' for the US.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trump has accused China of 'draining' the U.S. economy for years and said that 'they're not ready' to make a deal to end an escalating trade war.Trump's remarks came at a midterm campaign rally on Thursday night in the Mayo Civic Center in Rochester, Minnesota - a region hard hit by retaliatory Chinese tariffs on American soybeans.'For years China has been draining us, taking our factories and building up their country,' Trump said.'They wanna make a deal but I told 'em, 'You wanna make a deal, but you're not ready yet.' So we'll talk later,' Trump said.'They want to make a deal but I told 'em, 'You want to make a deal but you're not ready yet.' So we'll talk later,' Trump said at the rally on Thursday in MinnesotaTrump last month slapped tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese exports. Chinese leader Xi Jinping (left) is seen above at a reception on SundayIt came amid an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, with Trump last month slapping duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese exports - a figure well above America's total annual exports to China, leaving Beijing without the means of proportional response.Trump has said the tariffs are in response to China's 'unfair trade practices' including the theft of U.S. intellectual property.Last year, the U.S. ran a $376 billion trade deficit with China.Earlier on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence accused China of using retaliatory tariffs as a weapon to meddle in the midterm elections.'China is meddling in America's democracy,' Pence said in a speech at the Hudson Institute in Washington DC.He noted that tariffs Beijing's retaliatory tariffs 'specifically targeted industries and states that would play an important role in the 2018 election.'Earlier on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence accused China of using retaliatory tariffs as a weapon to meddle in the midterm elections'By one estimate, more than 80% of U.S. counties targeted by China voted for President Trump in 2016; now China wants to turn these voters against our administration,' Pence said.Pence accused the Chinese government of other efforts to harm Republicans in the midterms, including 'targeting U.S. state and local governments and officials to exploit any divisions between federal and local levels on policy'.China's retaliatory tariffs have hit US pork and soybean producers hard, with more than a third of American soybeans typically grown for export to China.Also on Thursday, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue admitted that the U.S. 'probably made a mistake' becoming too trade dependent on China and said that the administration was pursuing trade deals elsewhere.American farmers have been hit hard by the Trump administration's ongoing trade dispute with China, which has shut off billions of dollars worth of agricultural trade between the giant economies.Trump speaks during a rally at the Mayo Civic Center in Rochester, Minnesota on ThursdayMarie Hassing, 82, and her grandchildren, son and daughter-in-law were among those who were forced to watch Thursday's rally on giant screens in overflow areas'We probably made a mistake, frankly, IÂ´d say in hindsight, in becoming too dependent on that huge China market,' Perdue told a gathering of the North American Meat Institute forum in Washington.'When you have so much of your business in one big customer, disruptions like this can mean pain. I think our strategy is to go around the world.''There's a hungry world out there besides Canada, besides, China, and weÂ´re pursing that aggressively,' he added, saying the administration was seeking out new agreements with the European Union, Japan and India, among others.At Thursday night's rally, Trump also touted his new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, a revised version of NAFTA dubbed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).He said that NAFTA was a 'disaster' but that USMCA is a 'great and fair deal'.About 15 minutes into his speech, Trump addressed the saga that has gripped the nation, the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.'Democrats have been trying to destroy Judge Brett Kavanaugh since the very first second he was announced,' Trump said.'He was announced for one simple reason, he is an incredible intellect, an incredible person, an incredible talent, he has been an incredible judge.'Trump spoke at a midterm campaign rally on Thursday night in Rochester, MinnesotaSupporters of President Donald Trump cheer as he arrives for a campaign rally on ThursdayTrump predicted that Democrat opposition to Kavanaugh would provoke a backlash in the midterms, and drive Republican gains in Congress.'All you have to do is look at the polls over the last few days, and it show their rage-fueled resistance is starting to backfire at a level that nobody has ever seen before,' Trump said.'People see what's happening and they don't like it,' he continued.Upon mention of the nomination drama, the lively crowd at the rally began chanting 'We want Kavanaugh'.On Thursday morning, the FBI delivered to the Senate statements collected in its investigation into Christine Blasey Ford's claim that Kavanaugh groped her and pinned her down in 1982, which he denies.Two key Senate Republicans, Arizona's Jeff Flake and Susan Collins of Maine, signaled that they were satisfied that the FBI had found no corroboration for the allegations - though the senators did not formally declare how they intend to vote.The Senate is expected to vote to end debate on Kavanaugh's nomination on Friday, with a potential confirmation vote on Saturday.Friday's vote will reveal whether Kavanaugh has the votes to pass confirmation, as anyone who votes to end debate will likely vote to confirm.Republicans can withstand two defections from their own party and still pass the confirmation.Currently, three Republicans have not committed: Flake, Collins, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.Trump speaks during a rally at the Mayo Civic Center in Rochester, Minnesota on ThursdayTrump attended the rally in support of Republican Senate candidate Karin Housley (above)Trump attended the rally in support of Republican Senate candidate Karin Housley, who is facing appointed incumbent Democrat Tina Smith in a special election.The President also stumped for Republican Congressional candidates Jason Lewis and Jim Hagedorn.The outcome in Minnesota could prove critical as Republicans seek to counter Democratic enthusiasm in the midterm elections.In remarks to the crowd, Lewis turned to Trump and said: 'Minnesota loves your appointments to the Supreme Court, and that includes Brett Kavanaugh.'The rally held in the Mayo Civic Center, which has a capacity of 7,200.Trump lost Minnesota in the 2016 election by a razor-thin 1.52 point margin, but is hoping his appearance can boost enthusiasm among Republican midterm voters.Prior to the rally, Trump's supporters stood for the national anthem.After touching down at a crowd at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport before the rally, Trump briefly addressed a crowd of 100 supporters who gathered on the tarmac.'Thank you very much, thank you all very much. I think he's doing well. The judge is doing very well, don't you think?' Trump said, to cheers of approval from the crowd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by Andrew BEATTY US President Donald Trump slapped steep trade tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium Thursday, drawing sharp protests from allies at home and abroad as the contentious move raised the spectre of a global trade war.Signaling a sharp departure from a decades-long US-led drive for more open and less regulated trade, Trump declared that America had been â€œravaged by aggressive foreign trade practices.â€?â€œItâ€™s really an assault on our country,â€? he said, in announcing the tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum.Trump said the tariffs â€” which will come into effect after 15 days â€” will not initially apply to Canada and Mexico, and that close partners on security and trade could negotiate exemptions.â€œMany of the countries that treat us the worst on trade and on the military are our allies, as they call them,â€? he complained.The tariffs, worth billions of dollars, sparked immediate protests from top trading partners the European Union and Brazil, with retaliatory action expected from China and other economic powers.Leaning on a little-used and decades old national security clause in US trade law, Trump said he was fulfilling a campaign promise.â€œIâ€™ve been talking about this a long time, a lot longer than my political career,â€? he said. â€œWeâ€™ve been treated very badly by our past administrations, by presidents that represented us that didnâ€™t know what they were doing.â€?The mercurial 45th president compared his action to those of predecessors George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and William McKinley.â€“ â€˜Real friendsâ€™ -Canada, Americaâ€™s neighbor to the north, was its single-largest source of steel last year, followed by Brazil, South Korea, Russia, Mexico, Japan and Germany.Regarding alumina and aluminum, Canada was also by far the largest supplier followed by China, Russia and the United Arab Emirates.Trump had indicated he would be flexible toward â€œreal friends,â€? and during the signing confirmed Canada and Mexico would be permanently exempted if the ongoing renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement is successful.The US leader had also added Australia to a list of likely carve-outs, as a â€œgreat countryâ€? and â€œlong term partner.â€?But he singled out Germany for criticism, reviving a longstanding gripe that European NATO allies do not pay their fair share.â€œWe have some friends and some enemies where we have been tremendously taken advantage of over the years on trade and on military,â€? he said.The EUâ€™s top trade official Cecilia Malmstroem insisted the entire bloc â€œshould be excludedâ€? from the tariffs as a â€œclose ally,â€? vowing to â€œseek more clarityâ€? from Washington.Britain, meanwhile, said it would â€œwork with EU partners to consider the scope for exemptions outlined today,â€? saying â€œtariffs are not the right wayâ€? to tackle the problem of global over-capacity in steel.Major producer Brazil immediately vowed to take â€œall necessary stepsâ€? in order to â€œprotect its rights and interestsâ€? in response to the US move.China had also warned it was ready to respond â€” although Trump struck a more conciliatory tone in his announcement, pointing to negotiations underway to trim Washingtonâ€™s soaring bilateral trade deficit with Beijing.Japan, the sixth biggest exporter of steel to the US, also hit out.â€œThe measure could have a grave impact on the economic relationship of Japan and the USâ€¦ and also on the global economy,â€? said Foreign Minister Taro Kono, describing the move as â€œregrettableâ€?.Both Mexico and Canada, meanwhile, rejected Trumpâ€™s linkage of the levies to ongoing NAFTA talks.Canadaâ€™s foreign affairs minister termed the two things â€œseparate issuesâ€? while Mexicoâ€™s Economy Ministry said â€œthe negotiation of the NAFTA should not be subject to conditions outside the process.â€?â€“ Partners promise backlash -Last week Trump stunned the world â€” and his own aides â€” with an off-the-cuff announcement of his plan, even before White House lawyers judged the legality of the tariffs.The metals are used in everything from cars to construction, roads to railways.While the full economic impact remains unknown, the political fallout was swift with the top Republican in Congress Paul Ryan publicly denouncing Trumpâ€™s move, and vowing to push him to narrow its focus to â€œcountries and practices that violate trade law.â€?The European Union has promised tariffs on items from steel to peanut butter, bourbon and denim â€” most of which are produced in states that Trump needs to win reelection.Even as Trump approved the tariffs, 11 partners in the Asia-Pacific were in Santiago, Chile, to sign a multilateral trade deal embraced by president Barack Obama but rejected by Trump.The White House was left scrambling to catch up following Trumpâ€™s shock move last week, as top economic advisor Gary Cohn â€” who opposed it â€” quit in protest.

"Growing tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners could push the European Union to strengthen ties with the world's second largest economy and the U.S.' main rival, China, experts said Tuesday.In an analysis penned by Dr. Kadir Temiz and Murat Ã–ztuna for Anadolu Agency, the academicians pointed out that Washington has put Beijing's technologically ambitious 'Made in China 2025' vision at the center of its trade war with the country.The two economies have already imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other's imports. In his latest threat to the Asian nation, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion worth of Chinese imports.The report by Temiz and Ã–ztuna said China's ongoing economic development and its influence on global economy have already made competition with the U.S. inevitable. However, Washington choosing protective measures to prevent such competition has been regarded as a confession that the U.S. is losing control of the system it created, along with risks of weakening its own production.However, China still needs foreign technology transfers to advance its own innovation agenda and reach next-generation production targets, despite the breakthroughs in high-tech industries. The report argues that a possible Chinese decision to implement custom tariffs on U.S. commodities as retaliatory measures and seeking other alternatives would result in U.S. producers' limited access to their largest market.The growing complex economic competition might be an early sign of a new transformation, with Trump's protective policies offering far more obstacles and limitations than solutions, Temiz and Ã–ztuna point out. As a reaction, global actors may create a front against Trump's strong conservative resistance to change and transformation.Nevertheless, China is not the only country threatened by Trump's tariffs. The European Union â€“ whose steel and aluminum exports have also been hit by U.S. tariffs - seems to have left its traditionally cautious approach toward China, and last week's annual EU-China summit in Beijing is the latest example of that. Both parties released positive messages after the summit, with the EU praising China's contribution to free trade and globalization, and China proposing closer ties with the bloc.At the summit, the EU and China also signed their first joint declaration since 2015. Their previous differences over the South China Sea had prevented one in 2016 and 2017.They also agreed to expand market access and speed up negotiations for a bilateral investment agreement, now in their fourth year.For China, creating an alternative might be a good short-term solution but the EU will have a harder time showing the same flexibility, the report warns.Growing closer to China might be a good solution for the EU to break the pressure on economic and security issues created by the U.S. and a great opportunity to kick off a new globalization process. Germany, the economic powerhouse of Europe, has already started to develop closer economic and political ties with Beijing. Therefore the EU is likely to try to open a new page with China despite the latter's economic confrontations as other possibilities do not seem very pleasant for either side.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"When the U.S. exited TPP, the worry was that China, which is shopping its own 16-nation pact, would eclipse U.S. influence and emerge as the dominant force in Asia. Regardless of how one feels about past American foreign policy, the U.S. would not be better off if it gives such ground to a non-democratic state such as China.Fortunately, one of our most important allies in the region, Japan, stepped into the breach and kept TPP alive. In March, those efforts paid off as Japan, Australia, Vietnam and eight other nations signed a modified free-trade deal.Without the U.S., of course, TPP is far weaker than it would be otherwise, which creates an opening for China to exploit.But at the same time, the U.S. has come toe-to-toe with China over the latter's unfair trade practices. Trump brought this confrontation to a head by emphasizing intellectual property piracy, something practiced with some zeal in China, and thereby ignited a tit-for-tat tariff fight.The Trump administration was right to challenge China on these and other practices, even as escalating tariffs pose risks for our economy, especially in Texas, where exports to China are high. Last year, we exported $16 billion in goods to China, behind only what we send to Canada and Mexico.Back when TPP was being actively debated here, Pete Bonds, a Saginaw rancher, told The News why Texas beef producers were eager to knock down tariffs to other countries: 'The future of this business is not here in the U.S. It's offshore. Ninety-six percent of people in the world don't live in the U.S.'In surveying this history, one question sticks out in our minds: How much better would it be if we were confronting China as part of a 12-nation trading bloc rather than one on one? After all, China desperately needs the Pacific Rim nations that are part of TPP if it is to expand and meet the needs of its enormous middle class. If we were part of TPP, we'd have a stronger hand in devising trade rules that serve the interests of democratic countries and compel China to be better on trade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Amid the bleeding trade war with the US, China has removed an over five-year-long ban on the import of Indian rapeseed oil meal.China is the biggest consumer of oil meal of which rapeseed is a variant. Beijing has slapped additional tariffs on US oil meals in a full-blown trade war, looking to import from other countries.â€œChina has cleared the ban on Indian rapeseed meal. As long as Indian companies comply with Chinese regulations, they can export it,â€? an Indian government official told IANS.Beijing in 2012 had banned Indian imports, citing the presence of a particular pest in the crop.The official said the issue has now been resolved.Last month, a buyer-seller meet was organised by the Indian and Chinese governments in which Indian exporters made a strong pitch to resume rapeseed exports.New Delhiâ€™s trade engagement with Beijing seems to be increasing as both sides have pledged to put ties back on track after last yearâ€™s Doklam military stand-off.In an ice-breaking meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Wuhan in April, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked that Indian commodities be given more access to the Chinese market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON â€” If a trade war is coming, the cheesemakers of Wisconsin are standing in the line of fire. So are the farmers of the Great Plains and the distillers of Kentucky. And the employees of iconic American brands like Harley-Davidson and Levi Strauss.The likelihood of a trade conflagration leapt closer to reality this week after the United States imposed tariff on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Infuriated, the jilted U.S. allies vowed to retaliate with tariffs of their own. And in a separate dispute, China is poised to penalize $50 billion in U.S. goods â€” many of them produced by supporters of President Donald Trump in the Americaâ€™s agricultural heartland.â€œTheyâ€™re going to hit the farmers,â€? said Bryan Klabunde, a farmer in northwestern Minnesota. â€œWe want things fair for all industries, but weâ€™re going to take the brunt of the punishment if other countries retaliate.â€™â€?President Donald Trump, who entered office promising to rip up trade deals and crack down on unfair trading practices, is clashing with trading partners on all sides. To the north, heâ€™s battling Canada; to the south, Mexico; to the east, Europe; across the Pacific Ocean to the west, China and Japan.â€œThe president seems to be creating trade (and other) disputes with everyone â€” allies and adversaries alike â€” and itâ€™s difficult to discern any coherent strategy,â€? said Rod Hunter, a former National Security Council staffer under President George W. Bush. â€œThe impacts of the disputes have been limited so far, but the economic and political costs will go up as retaliation by trading partners begins in earnest.â€?Mexico, for instance, plans to retaliate against the steel and aluminum tariffs by targeting U.S. cheese, among other products.â€œItâ€™s our second-largest market,â€? Jeff Schwager, president of Sartori, a cheese company in Plymouth, Wisconsin, said of Mexico. Retaliatory tariffs â€œwill reduce sales â€” thereâ€™s no question.â€?â€œThe hard-earned sales weâ€™ve secured in Mexico could be at risk given the potential for retaliation,â€? the National Milk Producers Federation warned in a statement.The EU is threatening to penalize Kentucky bourbon and the motorcycles of Wisconsin-based Harley-Davidson. The potential tariffs pack a political punch: Theyâ€™d hurt constituents of House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican.On Friday, reporters in Louisville, Kentucky, asked McConnell if he thought the Europeans were trying to get his attention.â€œWell,â€? the Senate leader said, â€œthey got my attention. They didnâ€™t need to do that. These are our friends. These are not enemies. Canada and Mexico, Europe â€” these are our allies, and we need to work this out in a way thatâ€™s comforting to everyone.â€?Harley-Davidson has already absorbed higher steel and aluminum costs since Trump first announced the metals tariffs three months ago. Now, the threats of retaliatory tariffs from abroad raise the fear of higher prices for Harley motorcycles sold outside the U.S.In a statement, Harley-Davidson said retaliatory tariffs â€œwould have a significant impact on our salesâ€? in those countries. The Milwaukee-based company said it was evaluating options for controlling higher materials costs. In April, its chief financial officer warned that cost increases could be worse than the company forecast in January and might last for several quarters.The jeans maker Levi Strauss is also on the EUâ€™s target list.â€œAmerican brands, workers and consumers will ultimately suffer,â€? the San Francisco-based company said in a statement.Ben Steffen, a dairy farmer who also grows corn, soybeans, and wheat on 1,900 acres southeastern Nebraska near Humboldt, is angry about the U.S. tariffs being imposed on Americaâ€™s closest trade partners and allies.â€œIâ€™m upset because it hits me in my pocketbook from multiple angles,â€? he said. â€œI sell beef, I sell corn, I sell soybeans and I sell milk. All of those products are vulnerable because we export significant amounts in those markets.â€?The milk market has been depressed for about three years, and farmers have struggled to break even. About 14 percent of U.S. milk production is exported; the largest customer is Mexico.â€œThis is the worst possible thing to have for our milk market, and itâ€™s the same for every other commodity,â€? Steffen said. â€? These are important relationships.â€?In Stockton, California, Jeff Colombini is worried about the financial damage a trade war would bring to his 1,800-acre farm. His company, Lodi Farming, exports walnuts, cherries and apples to Mexico, Canada, the European Union and other countries.â€œWith these tariffs, itâ€™s going to make the product too expensive for the consumers in Mexico and in Canada and in the EU,â€? Colombini said. â€œWeâ€™re not going to be able to sell all of our crop. And so some of it is probably going to go unharvested or just dumped â€¦ I have 200 employees, and they depend on the success of this operation for their jobs to feed and clothe their families.â€?A trade fight with the Europe would also cause collateral damage across the Atlantic. Steelworkers in Port Talbot, Wales, who have struggled to protect their factory and 4,000 jobs, now face another threat.Union leader Mark Turner said workers are trying to sort out what the tariffs will mean for Port Talbot. But they feel â€œeverything is against us,â€? particularly given Britainâ€™s economic uncertainty as the country prepares to leave the European Union.â€œWe will keep fighting,â€? Turner said. â€œIf we canâ€™t go into the American market, then thereâ€™s other markets out there we will try and get into.An even higher-stakes trade dispute is playing out on the Pacific Rim. The United States and China are poised to impose tariffs on up to $200 billion worth of each otherâ€™s goods in a battle over Beijingâ€™s strong-arm efforts to overtake U.S. technological supremacy.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is traveling to Beijing this weekend for talks aimed at preventing an all-out trade war between the worldâ€™s two biggest economies. On the Chinese target list are American soybean farmers, who send about 60 percent of their exports to China.On Friday, Klabunde, who grows corn and soybeans on 3,000 acres near Waubun, Minnesota, spent two nerve-wracking hours with a hired hand, pulling a stuck tractor out of a drainage ditch. They finally got the machine free.â€œI think the tariffs and trade war scare me more than a stuck planter,â€? Klabunde said. â€œI can lose only so much money on a stuck planter. I can lose a lot more money in a trade war.â€?___Karnowski reported from Minneapolis___AP staffers Terry Chea in Stockton, California; Carrie Antlfinger in Plymouth, Wisconsin; Bruce Schreiner in Louisville, Kentucky; David Pitt in Des Moines, Iowa; Anne Dâ€™Innocenzio and Candice Choi in New York; David Koenig in Dallas; and Danica Kirka in London contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wolfram writes: 'It is time for the president to claim victory and end the trade war.' (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images)When President Trump imposed tariffs on aluminum and steel there was a strong reaction from much of the economics profession, arguing that the tariffs were bad both for the American economy and for the world economy in general. Indeed, I was one of more than 1,100 economists, including 15 Nobel Prize winners, who signed a letter to Trump and Congress opposing protectionist actions.The letter quoted extensively from a similar letter, also signed by more than 1,000 economists, that was written in 1930 warning of the economic consequences of the now infamous Smoot-Hawley, an act implementing protectionist trade policies sponsored by Sen. Reed Smoot and Rep. Willis Hawley and signed into law on June 17, 1930. The act raised tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods.Unfortunately, the 1930 letter was ignored and the consequences at the national and international level were dire as the world ended up in a trade war that was an important factor in the length and breadth of the Great Depression.The ramping up of tariffs by the administration and our trading partners in recent weeks suggests that it will take more than a letter from economists to end the harm to our economy from a trade war. As the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises once wrote: â€œEconomics is too important to be left to the experts.â€? It is important that the average American understand the negative effects of protectionist trade policy.Barriers to international trade must result in a decline in economic activity. Just imagine what your living situation would be if you could only purchase goods and services that were fully made in Michigan. Imagine how uncompetitive Michigan manufacturers would be if they could not use inputs that were made outside of Michigan.It should be obvious that if consumers and producers must pay taxes on goods and services that are produced outside the United States prices will be higher for consumers and costs will be higher for American producers. The higher costs for American producers will result in their being less competitive in the worldwide market and fewer employment opportunities for American workers. About half of all U.S. imports are either inputs into the production of goods in the U.S. or machinery used to produce goods in the U.S. How can taxing imports be beneficial to the U.S. economy?It is true that if you produce a particular good, say aluminum, then you will benefit from a tax that is imposed on your competitor. But everyone else in the economy is made worse off. Notice that the country whose citizens are made worse off by the tariff is the country imposing the tariff.A final point is that we hear talk of â€œtrade deficitsâ€? as if they were a bad thing. But it is important to know that a trade deficit is what happens if you have a â€œcapital account surplus.â€? A capital account surplus is when foreigners are investing more in your country than your citizens are in other countries. We would expect a country to have a capital surplus when its economy is doing well relative to other countries, since people would rather build a factory in an expanding economy than one that is not doing well. So if the U.S. has a capital account surplus it should be something people are celebrating. Indeed, we do have a capital account surplus in basically the same amount as our trade deficit.This is because the only way Germans can get dollars to build a factory in the United States is for them to sell us more than we buy from them. Thus a trade deficit is a necessary factor for a capital surplus.Taxing people for buying goods from foreigners, that is, imposing tariffs, not only makes our economy weaker by increasing the costs of production and raising prices in the U.S., it results in less investment in the United States and the resulting drag on productivity, wages and economic growth.It is time for the president to claim victory and end the trade war.Gary Wolfram is William Simon Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Hillsdale College.Read or Share this story: https://detne.ws/2v7GNCc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Protectionism has never ended well, British trade minister Liam Fox said on Thursday when asked about U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to withdraw from the World Trade Organization.Trump, who has complained the United States is treated unfairly in global trade and has blamed the WTO for allowing that to happen, said last month that he could pull out of the global body.'We should be pointing out that protectionism has never ended well,' Fox told parliament. 'The alternative to a rules-based system is a deals-based system which will upset the balance of global trade.'Fox said the power to withdraw from the WTO was not a presidential one but would require sanction by Congress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The trade war is declared between the United States and the European Union, after the entry into force of additional customs duties in Europe on dozens of American products, such as jeans, bourbon or motorbikes.These new taxes, officially imposed since Friday 0H00 Brussels time (Thursday 22H00 GMT), are the response of Europeans to the 25 percent taxes on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imposed by the United States to most countries of the world, including some of its allies.'The unilateral and unjustified decision of the United States' to impose these duties 'leaves us no choice,' insisted this week the European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m.'The rules of international trade cannot be violated without our reaction,' said MalmstrÃ¶m, adding that 'if the United States removed their tariffs,' European measures would be 'also removed'.Before the EU, Mexico, also concerned, had already set up retaliatory measures against Washington in early June, while Canada plans to do so in early July.Europeans are also caught in the crossfire between China and the United States, also engaged in an escalation of protectionist measures and threats of retaliation.'Mr. Trump has opened two (commercial) fronts and both could escalate out of control,' expert economist intelligence unit John Ferguson told AFP.Germany, a major exporter, is already seeing its growth forecasts dwindle, because of the global business climate, even though its exports are only marginally affected so far by US measures.It would be quite different if Donald Trump put into effect another threat, that of directly taxing cars imported into the United States - which would be particularly damaging to Japanese and German manufacturers.Taxes imposed by the EU apply on a list of goods manufactured in the United States, such as agricultural products (rice, corn, tobacco), steel, as well as vehicles (motorcycles, boat) or textile.'If we chose products like Harley-Davidson, peanut butter, bourbon, it's because there are alternatives in the (European) market, we do not want to do anything that could harm consumers,' EU Vice President Jyrki Katainen said Thursday.'Moreover, these products will have a strong political symbolic significance,' he argued.Europeans have long hoped to escape the punitive taxes announced in March by Donald Trump. But after two temporary exemptions and attempts at trade talks with Washington, the EU finally saw these taxes apply on June 1st.In the process, Europeans filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO). They also plan to introduce so-called 'safeguard' measures to protect their market from foreign steel and aluminum that would no longer find markets in the United States.The retaliatory measures applied since Friday on the American products correspond, in value, with the damages caused by the American decision on the European exports of steel and aluminum towards the United States, for a total of 6.4 billion euros in 2017.The EU will initially exercise its rights on US assets to the tune of 2.8 billion euros.The rebalancing of the remaining 3,600 million euros will take place in three years or after a possible victory of the Europeans in their appeal to the WTO.Transatlantic relations have floundered since Donald Trump's election because of disagreements over many issues, such as the Paris climate deal, the US embassy's move to Jerusalem, and Iran's nuclear deal.And they particularly strained after a recent tumultuous G7 summit, with the US president sharply rejecting the painfully negotiated joint declaration, which condemned 'protectionism.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to Chinese folk religion, the year of the dog, which recurs every 12 years in the cycle, is considered a challenging year in which harmony is crucial to achieving prosperity. So far, 2018 has proven to be extraordinary in this respect, since the desire to achieve harmony in U.S.-China trade relationshipâ€”the largest bilateral trading relationship in human historyâ€”has been overshadowed by continued disputes and accusations of unfair practices.Last November, President Trump enjoyed a very special privilege in China. He became the first U.S. president since the founding of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China in 1949 to be hosted for dinner by the Chinese government inside the Forbidden City in Beijing, the historic palace that once housed Chinese emperors and for centuries was forbidden to all except the Emperor, his family, and his attendants. When Chinese President Xi Jinping broke tradition and hosted a visiting U.S. president in the Forbidden City for the first time, the two countries walked away with more than $250 billion in mutually beneficial new business deals. Many China observers at the time mistakenly felt that President Trump was so eager to ingratiate himself with China that he allowed himself to â€œget playedâ€? or be â€œtaken inâ€? by the Chinese. But, as it turns out, this was not at all the case.Only two months later, President Trump decided, as he put it, â€œto take a stand on China,â€? because, he said, China had been taking advantage of the United States for too long. He therefore levied a 30% tariff on the import of Chinese solar panels; China is a world leader in the manufacturing of solar panels. On the same day, he imposed a 20% tariff on Chinese-made washing machines in order to protect Whirlpool and other U.S. manufacturers. The tariff applied to the first 1.2 million units imported during the year. To put that into perspective, China exported $425 million worth of washing machines to the United States in the previous year. Later on, in March, the Trump Administration imposed tariffs on imports of Chinese steel and aluminum. At the same time, it released a report alleging that China was engaged in unfair trade practices, such as intellectual theft, under Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974. As a result, over 1,300 categories of Chinese imports were subsequently targeted for tariffs.Thus began the U.S.-China trade war that we have witnessed this year. This trade war has not simply come upon us with unsettling speedâ€”it has also spilled over into other areas such as national security, technology transfers, immigration, and even joint educational initiatives. The Chinese stock market has plummeted. China has felt emboldened to contravene U.S. sanctions on Moscow, which were introduced in response to Russiaâ€™s destabilizing actions in Ukraine and its alleged interference in U.S. politics. China broke the sanctions by recently purchasing 10 Russian Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 missiles.As trade officials in both countries have worked hard to find ways to de-escalate the dispute, it has only escalated into a full trade war. In September, President Trump suddenly levied a 10 percent duty on USD $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, signaling that the dispute may not end anytime soon. Indeed, this duty could rise to 25 percent next year, and President Trump has threatened to place duties on a further USD $267 billion of Made-in-China goods. He has also indicated that he wants eventually to slap tariffs on all imports from China.With China planning to retaliate by levying duties on USD $60 billion of American goods, it appears the trade war may well continue to escalate. President Trumpâ€™s actions came as somewhat of a surprise to many long-time China observers. It appears they may have even caught the Chinese government off-guard, despite the fact that Trump gave repeated indications of his coming actions during his presidential campaign.It is clear that companies in both countriesâ€”the worldâ€™s two largest economiesâ€”will be hurt by the tariffs. Already, there are signs of supply chains being disrupted, and many firms are delaying investment decisions until they see more stability. So far, Trumpâ€™s tariffs have chiefly resulted in increased costs for U.S. businesses. These increased costs, however, will probably trickle down in some degree to the American consumer in time.It seems probable that China will move to seek a diplomatic resolution to the dispute as soon as possible, heeding the wisdom of Sun Tzu, its most renowned military strategist and philosopher, who once said: â€œThere is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.â€? Indeed, a prolonged trade war would not be in the best interest of the fragile global economy because it creates further uncertainties and anxieties. China knows also that a prolonged trade war will be especially detrimental to its own domestic economy and social stability. A prolonged trade war would threaten to burst the massive property bubble that has formed in China in recent years, which would precipitate a much greater crisis.About the authors: Siva Yam is president of the US-China Chamber of Commerce, a not-for-profit organization that was founded by the late Prescott Bush Jr. and dedicated to promoting trade and investment activities between the United States and China.

"Post-independence, Indiaâ€™s progress on many macroeconomic parameters have been more than satisfactory. However, the rising trade deficit owing to higher imports remains a major worry for the government. Indiaâ€™s position on merchandise export needs a serious boost to reverse the trend. The trade deficit widened from $135.8 billion in 2013-14 to $162.2 billion in 2017-18. China accounted for about 39% of Indiaâ€™s trade deficit in 2017-18. Indiaâ€™s total trade with China reached $89.6 billion in 2017-18, with Chinese export soaring to $76.27 billion. China enjoys an ever-rising trade surplus with most of the countries, including India.Today, Chinese traders find the Indian market more liberal and open, and hence their products are flooding our local market. Conversely, Indian traders are facing challenges to penetrate the Chinese market; total exports to China in 2017-18 stood at $13.33 billion lower than $14.82 in 2013-14. During April-June 2018, India exported goods valued at $3.97 billion to China compared to imports of $17.37 billion.On account of the favourable factors of the endowment, the Chinese manufacturing sector achieved global competitiveness. China is rapidly transitioning from â€˜supplier of cheap productsâ€™ to â€œsupplier of global brandsâ€?. Companies like Lenovo, Alibaba, Huawei, Haier, Xiaomi, and Cheetah Mobile are building brands beyond their home turf.Today, China is the largest supplier of solar modules or components to India. Prime Minister Modiâ€™s thrust on solar energy catapulted the domestic solar installations. Domestic production of solar cells, modules or components is inadequate to meet the unprecedented surge in demand, hence heavy import dependence on China. Solar cells or component imports from China jumped from $673 million in 2013-14 to $3.6 billion in 2017-18, over five-fold growth. Over-dependence on China for solar components is likely to rise in the future until domestic players like Vikram Solar and Adani compete well with the Chinese counterparts.At the moment, Chinese manufacturers, which offer cost advantages, are preferred over domestic producers in India. The question that arises is who wins the trade battle? Simple calculations on trade indicate that China is winning the trade battle not only with India but also with the US. The trade war between US and China means Chinese traders will target the Indian market to compensate for any loss of export to the US.Is India ready to counter the excessive Chinese exports? Already, domestic players in various sectors are under severe price pressure from â€œMade in Chinaâ€? supply. Make in India initiative of the Modi government is still to deliver the desired results. At the moment domestic competitiveness and market efficiency measures are inadequate. In the absence of market-driven competitiveness, trade measures are adopted within the framework of WTO which often leads to retaliation and conflict.India must find ways to cut down imports of (1) nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof; (2) electrical machinery and equipment and parts thereof; sound recorders and reproducers, television image and sound recorders and reproducers, and parts; (3) organic chemicals; (4) fertiliser; and (5) plastic articles from China. These products have contributed 69% of total imports from China in 2017-18.Indian pharmaceutical industry is capable of competing with the Chinese manufacturers. However, prevailing stringent regulatory and time-consuming approval process in China complicates the market access. The China-US trade war may open up the opportunity for Indian agro products shipment to China. However, sanitary and phytosanitary measures imposed by China will create bottlenecks for Indian agro-exporters. Chinaâ€™s imposition of 25% duty on US imports of US cotton opens up opportunities for Indian exporters. Further, export of IT products and services to China should be expanded.China must realise that India will not be able to sustain rising bilateral trade imbalance, so it must take necessary actions to address the issue on a priority basis.DRAGON POWERDuring April-June 2018, India exported goods valued at $3.97 billion to China compared to imports of $17.37 billionSolar cells imports from China jumped from $673 million in 2013-14 to $3.6 billion in 2017-18The author is associate professor & head, department of management studies at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Washington Insider: Trade War BureaucracyWhile the several rounds of international meetings in the last few days have dominated the press, yet another development is being highlighted in some areas. For example, Bloomberg says the administration earlier argued that trade wars were easyâ€”but efforts to equitably grant relief from new tariffs to those who qualify is leading to widespread criticism.Bloomberg highlighted the confusion and disappointment of one family-owned stainless steel manufacturer who says he must pay 'several hundred thousand dollars' as the result of the administration's new tariffs and wonders why.The Bloomberg report describes the position of a vice president of Stainless Imports Inc. and president of Sanitube LLC in Lakeland, Florida--one of the more than 40 initial U.S. companies whose requests for exemptions from tariffs on steel and aluminum imports were denied by the administration recently. The company was told its application was rejected for being incomplete, but says it had to wait almost three weeks for an answer about what was wrong and still has questions about the denial.While more than 30 companies have had their requests for relief from the duties granted so far, some businesses that were rejected say they weren't given adequate consideration after other companies objected. Others are still trying to get a complete explanation for why they were turned down. They're weighing how to respond and deal with added costs from duties that the administration began to impose in March on national security grounds.'[The President] is fighting this trade war with my money,' a company official said. 'It's a gut punch.'Companies can request exclusions from the duties if the imports they need are not produced in the required quantity or quality in the U.S. or for national-security considerations. More than 26,400 requests had been filed as of July 9, with 719 decisions so far, according to the Commerce Department.Another company told Bloomberg they were '100 percent' confident of receiving an exclusion because they must use a Chinese mill to get the unusually sized tube product needed for the order to supply a Midwestern dairy factory. There were high fives at the company with 15 employees because the contract was for more than $1 million, when the firm's average order is $20,000, it said.The Commerce Department decided in June that the company's request 'has not met the requirements for consideration as a 'complete submission.'' But company officials said it wasn't clear what was incomplete, and it took repeated calls and emails before they were told his application had the wrong product code -- a code that it has been using on imports for years, including on the order in question.Arrow Gear Co. in Downers Grove, Illinois, also said it hasn't gotten an explanation why four of its applications were rejected for being incompleteâ€”although it still has 10 applications pending, said John Waller, the company's material manager.The firm has 200 employees and wants duty relief from steel imported from the UK to make gears and pinions for aircraft. It doesn't have a 'Plan B' besides resubmitting corrected applications, Waller said.'For me, the whole not knowing is worse than anything else,' Waller said.The Commerce Department said it hasn't received requested funds to add needed staff but that virtually all inquiries have received a response as of Monday. However, mistakes such as submitting incorrect product codes are beyond its control, the department said, adding that companies should contact U.S. Customs and Border Protection for help before refiling.Kyle Isakower, vice president for regulatory and economic policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said the administration's process is arbitrary and lacks transparency. 'It's not clear how and why certain exclusion petitions are granted or denied,' Isakower said in a statement.Joel Johnson, chief executive officer of Borusan Mannesmann Pipe U.S. Inc., said he made what he thought was a good offer to the deal-making president: grant his Texas pipe maker's exclusion on importing steel from its parent company in Turkey to finish in Baytown and he'd build a new mill and hire 170 people.But the administration rejected the company's exclusion requests, after other companies including U.S. Steel Corp. objected.U.S. Steel said that Borusan was trying to 'bootstrap' an argument related to national security by promising to build the new factory and the Commerce Department agreed. Johnson said he's reviewing his options--but the duties will cost his company between $25 million and $35 million a year.'I think it's just they didn't maybe understand our offer,' Johnson said. ''No' is a lot easier to say than 'yes.''Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has promised changes to address criticisms of the exclusion process, including immediately granting a request if it's properly submitted and no objections are received.But Ross told the Senate Finance Committee in June that based on what officials have seen, 'there is a high probability that relatively few of those will be granted' because many lack substance or face well-grounded objections. Ross also has suggested that some companies are 'gaming the system' by filing requests they know don't qualify.So, it looks like the administration's management of its tariffs is leading to self-inflicted wounds on U.S. producersâ€”and probably is yet another government intervention that is much, much harder to administer than expected, in spite of the long history of such unanticipated problems.

"However, Canada and Mexico still retain the right to retaliate against the U.S. if mandatory COOL is brought back.***Washington Insider: Why Soybeans are on Frontlines in Trade WarBloomberg is carrying a detailed analysis this week asking why soybeans are on the front lines of the U.S. China trade war. The report says that while China is targeting a slew of American farm goods in this round of taxes, soybeans are the top agricultural commodity China imports from the U.S. â€“ by far.Soybeans yield cooking oil as well as animal feed and account for about 60% of the $20 billion of U.S. ag exports to China. Before the tariffs were announced, a study by the University of Tennessee forecast that a 25% duty would spark a drop in American shipments of at least $4.5 billion. Brazil, already the worldâ€™s biggest soybean shipper, is set to be the biggest winner, filling much of the gap left by the U.S., Bloomberg says.The tariff announcements have already weighed on soybean prices, the report notes. Most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade sank 14% in June as tensions swelled between the U.S. and China, the largest loss in four years.As demand is threatened, supply looks strong. Brazil harvested a bumper crop earlier this year. And U.S. farmers planted one of the highest soybean areas on record and growing conditions have proven favorable so far this season, Bloomberg says.China is the worldâ€™s largest soybean consumer and remains heavily reliant on imports, so â€œthe countryâ€™s buying habits have an outsize inÃ¯Â¬â€šuence on global prices.â€? By imposing the tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, China is targeting one of the few sectors of the American economy that runs a trade surplus at a time when net farm income is poised to fall to a 12â€“year low. Also, soybeans are one of the largest U.S. goods exports to China â€” trailing just civilian aircraft and motor vehicles by value this year, Bloomberg says.Brazil has been the worldâ€™s top soybean shipper since the 2012/13 season. Its lead has widened against the U.S. in recent seasons and Chinaâ€™s tariffs may serve to accelerate Brazilian demand. Brazil typically dominates global shipments at this time of year, while the U.S. takes over from about October through January, as the new harvest supplies become available.Brazil has posted swift gains in soybean production, spurring the export rivalry. A boom in global soy prices in the midâ€“1970s encouraged the government to invest in technology to adapt the crop to the countryâ€™s weather and soil. That created successful varieties that allowed planting in the Cerrado region, including what today is the top producer state, Mato Grosso. The biggest acreage jump occurred since 2000, as Chinaâ€™s demand climbed.As China formalized its plans last month to act against U.S. agricultural products, soybean premiums at Brazilian ports soared. Demand for South American supplies has surged even though U.S. futures are tumbling and U.S. soybean prices may see an â€œincreasingly severeâ€? impact if trade tensions remain through harvest, CoBank recently reported.The longerâ€“term impact is less certain. Brazil doesnâ€™t export enough soybeans to meet Chinaâ€™s demand alone, and there are few other major shippers besides the U.S., which will begin harvesting its next crop in September.Argentina also is a signiÃ¯Â¬?cant grower of the oilseed, but more commonly exports processed meal and oil. Lower Chinese demand for U.S. oilseeds may be partially offset by rising exports to destinations like the European Union, Rabobank recently reported.China still has about 1.14 million tonnes of outstanding U.S. soybean sales on the books for delivery by Aug. 31, though some cargoes have recently been switched for delivery in countries like Bangladesh and Iran, USDA says.Bloomberg doesnâ€™t say so but other have â€” U.S. soybeans appear to represent to the Chinese a large, vulnerable sector that includes numerous administration political supporters and the current trade fight is seen by many as an administration initiative that is already highly unpopular among parts of that group.So, we will see what happens. Both sides appear to be deeply dug in now, with increasingly important escalations being made. This is a fight that is being closely watched across the ag sector, and among politicians â€” although the outcome remains uncertain. It likely will remain increasingly contentious for the foreseeable future, Washington Insider believes.Want to keep up with events in Washington and elsewhere throughout the day?

"The Chinese government said that it was 'forced to counterattack' against US punitive tariffs on its imports, which went into effect early on Friday.A statement from the Chinese Commerce Ministry denounced US actions as 'a violation of world trade rules' and warned that the current dispute between both countries was launching the 'biggest trade war in history.'Speaking hours after the tit-for-tat duties went into effect, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said no one would emerge a winner from a trade war.'Trade war is never a solution,' Li said at a news briefing with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov in Sofia.'China would never start a trade war but if any party resorts to an increase of tariffs then China will take measures in response to protect development interests.'US President Donald Trump began the trade dispute when he imposed 25 percent duties on approximately $34 billion (â‚¬29 billion) in Chinese machinery, electronics and high-tech equipment including autos, computer hard drives and LEDs.The long-threatened tariffs went into effect on Friday as months of dialogue between the world's two largest economies failed to reach a solution or lessen Washington's outrage over its current trade imbalance with the Asian giant.The US trade deficit in goods with China stood at a record $375 billion in 2017.The Trump administration accuses China of building its emerging industrial dominance by 'stealing the crown jewels' of American technological know-how through cyber-theft, forced transfers of intellectual property, state-sponsored corporate acquisitions and other underhand practices.Read more: Opinion: A fight for economic supremacyChina to appeal at WTOLu Kang, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, confirmed to news agency AFP that his government's retaliatory tariffs were already in effect. 'After the US activated its tariff measures against China, China's measures against the US took effect immediately,' Lu Kang said, though he did not elaborate on the details of the measures.Previously, Beijing had vowed to impose counter-tariffs of 25 percent would apply on US agricultural and other products worth $34 billion.China said it plans to inform the World Trade Organization about the 'situation' and work with other countries to defend the multilateral system of free trade, the ministry said.International Trade Center Executive Director Arancha Gonzalez told DW that the world was facing 'the largest trade conflict since the Second World War.''Itâ€™s already affecting workers who are being laid off as a result of decisions, especially in America, to move out of the country and produce elsewhere, given the tariffs. Itâ€™s having an impact on businesses that are not making capital investment decisions because of the uncertainty of the situation,' she said.'But letâ€™s not forget: tariffs are taxes. Taxes that the consumer will have to pay. It will make â€” it is making already â€” American consumers pay more for the goods they buy. And itâ€™s making American companies less competitive,' Gonzalez said.Read more: Trump's tariffs: When does a trade spat become an actual trade war?Customs delaysReuters news agency reported that as of Friday morning, when tariffs took effect, some major Chinese ports had delayed clearing goods from the US.

"50 kilograms or 110 pounds. That is the maximum Nathalie can smuggle in one night. She knows a shortcut to avoid the border control. Her heavy bags are packed with used trousers, dresses and shirts from Europe and North America. 'If you get caught, you can go to jail. If you are lucky, you can bribe the police,' she said.One trip takes her two days. Eight hours by van from Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, to the place near the border where her parents live. Another hour by boat to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. There she spends the day at the market. 'I look for all kinds of clothes. Back home, the people buy everything because secondÂ­hand clothes are hard to get.'High tariffs for textiles in Rwanda, pressure from the USNathalie's 50 kilograms of used clothes are just a minor contraband compared to other smugglers. Rwandan authorities have impounded 230 tons of illegally imported clothes from July to December 2017. This is a consequence of the rise of tariffs for textiles from $0.20 (â‚¬0,17) to $2.50 (â‚¬2,09) per kilogram by the Rwandan government. The high tariffs are part of the strategy to strengthen the domestic textile sector. Currently, local production cannot compete with the quality and price of used clothes from the West. In 2015, the states of the East African Community (EAC) decided to ban the import on secondÂ­hand clothing from 2019 onward.Read more: Kenyatta and Trump: In search of a reputation boostToday, Rwanda is the only state that sticks to this plan.

Share US cautions Africans against banning used clothes Send Facebook google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/2tQbN US cautions Africans against banning used clothesProfitable donationsThe duty-free benefits for Rwanda were part of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a free trade agreement between the EAC and the US. After Rwanda increased the import tariffs for used textiles, the American Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles Association filed a petition lobbying an AGOA eligibility review, arguing the ban 'imposed significant hardshipâ€? on the US usedÂ­ clothing industry.Why does one of the most powerful states in the world care so much about used clothes in one of the smallest countries in Africa? One reason is money: the secondÂ­hand clothing trade is big business in East Africa. Although many people in the West give their old garments as donations to caritative organizations, the textiles are then being commercialized. Charities and companies either sell the clothes in secondÂ­hand shops or export them.Read more: Opinion: banning secondhand imports doesn't solves East Africa's problemsGikomba market in Nairobi, Kenya, is said to be the biggest used clothing market in East AfricaNew, cheap clothes from ChinaSecondhand clothes in Rwanda were cheap before 2016. Now that the import tariffs are more than ten times higher, the price of a used garments can be as much as for a new piece made in Rwanda. Due to high production costs, locally manufactured textiles are too expensive for the majority of Rwandans. Therefore, a ban of secondÂ­hand clothes could lead to a vacuum demand of affordable fashion.This makes smuggling of used clothes for people like Nathalie very attractive. But this vacuum could also be filled otherwise. 'Some say the import ban will increase cheap textile imports from China,' said Helmut Asche, professor of economy and African studies at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany.That would just be a substitution for the secondÂ­hand clothes from the US. 'In the short run the deficit will be covered by new clothes from Asiaâ€?, Rodgers Mukwaya from the UN Economic Commission for Africa told DW in February.

The paper concludes, that imports of Chinese clothing constitute the real threat to the East African textile industry. According to USAID's East Africa Trade Investment Hub, the EAC already imports more new clothes from China that used clothes from the US.In January 2017, the New York Times published a list of Africa related questions from the Trump transition team to the State Department. Amongst them: 'How does US business compete with other nations in Africa? Are we losing out to the Chinese?' The framing and tone of the questions reflect the rivalry between the two great powers on the world stage and on the world's largest continent. According to the China-Africa Research Initiative, China surpassed the US as Africa's top trade partner in 2009. Chinese exports to Africa have reached about $103 billion (â‚¬87 billion) in 2015, while the US exports to Africa amounted to only $27 billion (â‚¬ 23 billion) the same year.'Research showed that actually Chinese investors benefit from investments and trade in Africa,' said Dr. Francis Owusu, who is a professor at Iowa State University and originally from Ghana. 'From this perspective, it could be a trade war between US and China that is taking place in African countries with Chinese investors using Africa as a way to get to the US market.'Read more: Africa needs unified regulations against cheap Chinese importsRwanda's textile products on their way to EuropeWhile the planned import ban of secondhand clothes is already changing the dynamics of the textile business in Rwanda, the suspension of trade benefits is not expected to affect Rwanda's economy much. 'Most countries in Eastern Africa benefited very little from AGOA â€“ with the exception of Kenya,' Mukwaya from the UN Economic Commission for Africa said. 'So any ban from the US will not have a big effect on the exports from Eastern Africa.'Rwanda is only suspended from its duty-free benefits for apparel, which holds a comparatively small share of all exports to the U.S. In 2016, it was approximately four percent with an export value of $1.19 million (â‚¬1.01 million). The export value of coffee to the U.S. was $22.1 million (â‚¬18 million) for the same year. In total, Rwanda exports in total hold a value of $870 million (â‚¬742 million).

"US President Donald J. Trump responds to a question from the news media during a joint press conference with President Raimonds Vejonis of Latvia, President Kersti Kaljulaid of Estonia, and President Dalia Grybauskaite of Lithuania in the East Room in Washington, DC, USA April 3, 2018. EPA-EFE FILE/SHAWN THEWAfter China proposed 25 percent tariffs on imports of certain US products, President Donald Trump said Wednesday that there was no trade war with China because the conflict 'was lost many years ago' by previous administrations.'We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the US,' Trump said in a Twitter post.'Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!' the president said.China's decision to impose tariffs on 106 additional products purchased from the United States, including soy, corn, beef, orange juice, tobacco, cars and some types of aircraft, is estimated to raise the cost of goods by nearly $50 billion (40 billion euros).On Tuesday, the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) released a list of 1,300 Chinese products earmarked for tariffs in response to what Washington calls 'unfair trade practices' by Beijing, the second-largest trade partner of the US.A few weeks ago, Trump ordered 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports in a step seen by the markets and many analysts as furthering a trade confrontation between the world's two largest economies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(Permanent Musical Accompaniment To The Last Post Of The Week From The Blogâ€™s Favourite Living Canadian)True Tales of the Trade War: Part I: The Tale of the Wandering Sorghum.From Bloomberg, we learn of the saga of the RB Eden, a ship that loaded up with American sorghum in Corpus Christi and set sail for China. Then, the trade war broke out.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowThe bulk carrier RB Eden was loaded with the grain at Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.â€™s terminal in Corpus Christi, Texas, and was initially bound for Shanghai. When China announced a 179 percent tariff on imports of sorghum in mid-April, it performed a U-turn in the Indian Ocean, according to vessel data tracked by Bloomberg, and sailed back around southern Africa toward Europe. The vesselâ€™s destination was changed to Cartagena, Spain, but according to the data, it never docked. On May 18, China scrapped its anti-dumping and anti-subsidy probe into sorghum. The same day, the RB Eden began sailing back toward the Atlantic. Itâ€™s currently bound for Singapore.The RB Eden was not the only Flying Dutchman of the sorghum trade, either. From Reuters:The Peak Pegasus loaded U.S. sorghum from trader ADMâ€™s Corpus Christi grain elevator in Texas and departed on April 3 for Nansha in southern China, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. The cargo is one of almost two dozen bought by China but now stranded after Beijing said it would impose a hefty deposit on U.S. shipments of the grain in an anti-dumping probe. Importers now facing losses of millions of dollars on their cargoes are trying to resell the grain to buyers elsewhere but are being forced to offer steep discounts.Wonâ€™t somebody please think of the sorghums?Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowTrue Tales of the Trade War: Part II: The Tale of the Lobster FleetIt seems that we have been squabbling with our Good Neighbors to the North over some fishing rights since before we unfortunately started invading them. But, this is the United States in 2018, so, naturally, everything is worse. From the Globe and Mail:In the past two weeks, at least 10 Canadian fishing boats from New Brunswick have been intercepted by U.S. Border Patrol agents while fishing in the disputed waters around Machias Seal Island, a spokesperson for the fishermen says.Laurence Cook, chairman of the advisory board for Lobster Fishing Area 38, said Wednesday that some Canadian vessels were boarded by American agents who asked about possible illegal immigrants. â€œThereâ€™s been a bit of a misunderstanding there somewhere,â€? Cook said in an interview. â€œTheyâ€™re in international waters, so border patrol shouldnâ€™t be boarding Canadian vessels.â€? Machias Seal Island, which is about 19 kilometres southwest of Grand Manan Island and east of Maine, is in a disputed area known as the Grey Zone, where lobster fishermen from both Canada and the United States have long fished side by side.â€œNeither country accepts that there is a Grey Zone,â€? said Stephen Kelly, a research scholar at Duke University in Durham, N.C., and a former American diplomat who served in Canada. â€œThatâ€™s created more tension in the area over the last decade.â€? Kelly said both countries have done very little to assert their claims. â€œSometimes doing nothing is better,â€? he said. â€œBut in this case, just because it looks like itâ€™s not broken can be very deceiving â€” especially with our new president in the United States. The last thing Canada wants is for Donald Trump to seize on this as an example of U.S. sovereignty being challenged.â€? The suggestion that the border agents were looking for illegal immigrants seems improbable, he said.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowImprobable?

From Minnesota Public Radio:There, thousands of bushels of Minnesota-grown soybeans are dumped into rail cars, headed for the Pacific Northwest and then out for export. Assistant general manager Bill Doyscher doesn't know exactly where the beans will end up, but since China is the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, it's a fair assumption that some of his trainloads will end up there. China is scheduled to make good Friday on something it's threatened for months: A 25 percent tariff on U.S. soybeans. 'If export business tails off, then the volumes don't move, and then the efficiencies are less, and your opportunity for income is less,' Doyscher said last week. So far, he said, his elevator's export business is good, but he's seeing signs of a slowdown. Orders for future delivery have already begun to lag. Some Minnesota farmers fear these ongoing trade issues will make it impossible for them to stay in business: That the new tariff will hurt U.S. soybean exports to China, reduce what they're paid for the soybeans they sell and, ultimately, reduce their profits. Some of those fears have already become reality: Because the market tends to respond ahead of changes, prices have already been dropping for several weeks in anticipation of the move.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWonâ€™t somebody please think of the soybeans?This is America in 2018. Everything is weird and terrible.I suppose I should have something to say about this story involving alma mammy. By and large, I think campus speech codes are trash. But, then again, so is doxxing people online, which is one of the things John McAdams likes to do. But before we start saving him a seat in John Peter Zenger Land, letâ€™s take a closer look at his lawsuit.For all his self-gratification, free-speech-wise, McAdams and his legal team took Marquette to court and argued that Marquetteâ€™s disciplining McAdams constituted a breach of his contract, and it was on those grounds that the Wisconsin Supreme Court decided in his favor. However, itâ€™s quite clear that if, say, a FoxConn employee gets fired a couple of years down the line for criticizing Scott Walker on his personal Facebook page, the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty will have an unbreakable dental appointment and, alas, be unable to take the case. From The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel:Many conservatives argue universities should have more latitude to fire tenured faculty, but this case played out differently. The McAdams case favors job protections because conservatives believe their viewpoints are being stifled on college campuses. McAdams, who had continued through his suspension to blog as Marquette Warrior, has not shied away from criticizing his employer over campus matters with political overtones. Local and national lobbying associations for businesses and manufacturing lined up against McAdams. They filed 'friend of the court' briefs in support of the private Jesuit university and its right to discipline employees under provisions of an employment contract. Marquette argued the case wasn't about academic freedom or free expression, but contractual rights of a private employer to discipline an employee who acts unprofessionally through a mutually agreed-upon disciplinary process.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowAnd the Wisconsin Supremes, it should be noted, are possessed of a conservative majority because of a noxious flood of dark money over the past several election cycles. (An elected judiciary continues to be the Second Worst Idea In American Politics.) Justice Rebecca Bradley, who read the decision in favor of McAdams, is a Walker appointee who wrote some really ugly stuff when she was a student at Marquette and who was recommended to Walker for appointment by the lawyer who represented McAdams before her, and who won election to the seat to which she had been appointed with the Koch apparatus behind her campaign.The Wisconsin Supremes are so loaded with conservatives that Justice Daniel Kelly wrote the majority opinion and then wrote his own concurrence with himself. Not that they were anxious to rule on this case or anything.So, hurray for free speech, I guess. Iâ€™m sure McAdams will be filing an amicus brief for Ward Churchill, or actively opposing Walker's attacks on academic freedom at Wisconsin's flagship university.WWOZ Pick To Click: â€œBallade dâ€™ Emile Benoitâ€?

(â€œCentral America,â€? the Brit announcer calls it.) The Dust Bowl years were brutal in Montana. That, and the yearly descent of clouds of grasshoppers. Children killed sage grouse with rocks for food. Farmers and ranchers killed cattle that had grown too weak to stand. History is so cool, but the weather and the times certainly were not.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowOne of the reasons I decline to drop my subscription to The New York Times is that the newspaper still has the will and the resources to do right by stories like this one, about a renegade zoologist in the Rockies who has run up against the local agribusiness powers and livestock czars in his effort to study and protect apex predatorsâ€”specifically, the gray wolf. Rob Wielgus is his name, and heâ€™s worth knowing about.He first became interested in carnivores when he embarked on graduate school and received an offer to join a grizzly-bear research effort in Alberta. â€œThe danger of grizzlies really turned my crank because I was an adrenaline junkie,â€? he told me that night at the bar in Republic (where the eveningâ€™s chief threat turned out to be a bartender who didnâ€™t have Wielgusâ€™s preferred whiskey). He got his doctorate studying grizzlies in western Canada and northern Idaho, then went to the Pyrenees for a year to help with bear recovery. In 1997, Wielgus took a job as an assistant professor at W.S.U. He started the Large Carnivore Conservation Laboratory and began to study mountain lions. Through their work, he and colleagues discovered something fascinating: Killing adult males actually increased cougar sightings and also the number of cattle and sheep killed by other mountain lions, as younger cougars showed up in the old catâ€™s territory. The studies later played a part in a decision not to expand the hunting of mountain lions in the state.In 2012, the state asked Wielgus to calculate a population model for Washingtonâ€™s wolf-recovery plan. Wielgus had never studied wolves before, but he had a successful ongoing collaboration with the stateâ€™s wildlife agency, and the job aligned well with the labâ€™s overall focus. The agency was pleased with the modeling work and came back with a much larger offer: to oversee a multimillion-dollar research project as part of wolvesâ€™ return to Washington. Funded by the state Legislature for at least four years, the work would try to get to the bottom of the age-old conflict between wolves and livestock.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowAs the story makes clear, the conflict between farm livestock and wolves goes all the way back to the days when the white settlers were pushing the Nez Perce off in the general direction of Saskatchewan. Wolves were hunted to near-extinction, and brought back through the efforts of conservationists and the Endangered Species Act. It was Wielgusâ€™s job to study the effects of the reintroduced species. Which a number of the local landed gentry didnâ€™t like.All sides got a taste of Wielgus in the summer of 2014 after wolves from the Huckleberry pack in northeast Washington killed dozens of sheep that belonged to a single rancher. (Packs are usually named after a nearby mountain or other feature, in this case Huckleberry Mountain.) As events unfolded, there was plenty of blame to go around, said Carter Niemeyer, a well-regarded wolf expert who worked with Wielgus at the time: The rancher didnâ€™t take prudent efforts to safeguard his sheep, which fomented the chaos; then, a government shooter made the critical mistake of killing the wolf packâ€™s breeding female. Afterward, at a meeting of the Wolf Advisory Group, a regular convening of ranchers, hunters, local politicians and environmentalists that helps guide the stateâ€™s wolf policy, Wielgus stood up and criticized just about everyone involved, recalled Niemeyer, who was at the meeting. â€œSome of the stuff Rob is doing is what a lot of us would like to do, but we know better,â€? Niemeyer told me. â€œHe walks in and doesnâ€™t respect the politics of wolves.â€?If you canâ€™t be fascinated by a story that includes the phrase, â€œthe politics of wolves,â€? well, I donâ€™t know what to tell you.

Itâ€™s always a good day for dinosaur news!'This tiny beetle lived during the Cretaceous Period, it saw actual dinosaurs,' says Shuhei Yamamoto, a researcher at the Field Museum in Chicago and co-lead author of a paper describing the beetle in Cretaceous Research. 'The amber the beetle was found in is like a time capsule.' The new beetle, the earliest member of its family to get a scientific name, is called Kekveus jason. 'Jason' is a reference to the Greek hero who sailed the world in search of the Golden Fleece; 'Kekveus,' meanwhile, doesn't mean anything -- co-lead author Vasily Grebennikov of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, picked it because new genus names for little-known fossils often wind up changing when the species is later reclassified as scientists learn more about it. 'From my perspective, I always believe that an animal name should not have any meaning (except when named after a person), since if the authors are wrong, it might be odd to have later species 'chinensis' endemic to Europe, or something similarly absurd,' says Grebennikov.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowThat seems a bit harsh.

"China has increased tariffs by up to 25% on 128 US products, from frozen pork and wine to certain fruits and nuts, escalating a spat between the worldâ€™s biggest economies in response to US duties on imports of aluminium and steel, write Ben Blanchard and Tony Munroe.The tariffs, to take effect on Monday (2 April), were announced late on Sunday by Chinaâ€™s finance ministry and matched a list of potential tariffs on up to $3 billion in US goods published by China on 23 March.Soon after the announcement, an editorial in the widely read Chinese tabloid Global Times warned that if the US had thought China would not retaliate or would only take symbolic counter-measures, it can now â€œsay goodbye to that delusionâ€?.Related coverage Trump to unveil China tariff list this week, targeting tech goodsâ€œEven though China and the U.S. have not publicly said they are in a trade war, the sparks of such a war have already started to fly,â€? the editorial said.Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Commerce said it was suspending its obligations to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to reduce tariffs on 120 US goods, including fruit and ethanol. The tariffs on those products will be raised by an extra 15%.Eight other products, including pork and scrap aluminium, will now be subject to additional tariffs of 25%, it said, with the measures effective from 2 April.â€œChinaâ€™s suspension of its tariff concessions is a legitimate action adopted under WTO rules to safeguard Chinaâ€™s interests,â€? the Chinese finance ministry said.China is moving swiftly with retaliatory action amid escalating trade tensions between Beijing and Washington, which have rocked global financial markets in the past week as investors feared a full-blown trade spat between the two countries will be damaging for world growth.US President Donald Trump is separately preparing to impose tariffs of more than $50bn on Chinese goods intended to punish Beijing over US accusations that China systematically misappropriated American intellectual property â€“ allegations Beijing denies.China has repeatedly promised to open its economy further, but many foreign companies continue to complain of unfair treatment. China warned the United States on Thursday not to open a Pandoraâ€™s Box and spark a flurry of protectionist practices across the globe.â€œThere are some people in the West who think that China looks tough for the sake of a domestic audience, and would easily make concessions in the end,â€? the Global Times editorial said.â€œBut they are wrong.â€?The Global Times is run by the ruling Communist Partyâ€™s official Peopleâ€™s Daily, although its stance does not necessarily reflect Chinese government policy.Reaction to Chinaâ€™s measures varied on Chinese social media, with some saying Chinese customers would be the one ultimately paying for the trade war.â€œWhy not directly target soybean and planes?

"GETTY The US dollar has been kept on weak form todayWhile the latest UK trade balance showed a smaller-than-expected deficit of -Â£3.07 billion during January, construction output fell by a much worse-than-expected -3.9 per cent year-on-year during January. Manufacturing and industrial production also disappointed the consensus forecasts. Manufacturing grew 0.1 per cent month-on-month compared to forecasts of 0.2 per cent and industrial production rose 1.3 per cent month-on-month against expectations for 1.5 per cent growth. Also holding the pound back is the revelation that UK officials believe that a Brexit deal may not be agreed with the EU until January 2019.This would leave two months for the terms to be ratified. Markets are now waiting to see whether the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) GDP estimate for the three months to February will be the 0.3 per cent expected. The US dollar has been kept on weak form by the approach of todayâ€™s high-impact non-farm payrolls report for February, as well as continued fears over the impact of a trade war upon the US economy. US President Donald Trump yesterday signed an order to impose tariffs of 25 per cent on imports of steel and 10 per cent on imports of aluminium.This will come into effect in 15 days time, although it includes exemptions for Canada and Mexico while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is renegotiated. The planned tariffs have received heavy criticism in public, with figures including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan stating their opposition to the tariffs. While Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer has supported the idea of tariffs, he has implored president Trump to be more targeted in his approach. Many economists and White House officials are concerned that the impact of tariffs could raise domestic prices and weaken consumer spending, damaging the very industries Trump is attempting to protect.How to get the best exchange rate Sun, July 15, 2018 Exchange rate: How to get the best deal on your holiday money.

"The US and China have slapped import taxes each other in an escalating trade war. Despite a brief respite in May following a visit to Washington by Vice Premier Liu He, the top economic adviser to Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping, tax increases continue to be implemented. The latest of these exchanges was in September, with the US announcing a 10 percent tariff on $200billion (Â£153bn) worth of Chinese goods, which would increase to 25 percent by the end of 2018. The US simultaneously threatened to add tariffs to a further $267billion (Â£205bn) if China retaliated, which it did with 10 percent tariffs on $60billion (Â£46bn) of US imports on September 18.As this back and forth between the two countries continues, what implications will this have should an agreement fail to materialise? Speaking to Express.co.uk, Tony Hughes, CEO at global skills development company, Huthwaite International, said: â€œThe trade war between the United States and China has escalated once again with both sides announcing their biggest waves of punitive tariffs yet. â€œThe two superpowers have imposed export rates on more than $360 billion of manufactured goods and commodities and analysts are predicting the battle is far from over. â€œThe clash between the worldâ€™s top two economies is already hurting businesses on both sides of the Pacific and the latest US move means roughly half of the products that China sells to the US each year will be hit by American tariffs.â€?Donald Trump and Xin Jinping are at war over tradeAmerican multinational investment bank and financial services company Morgan Stanley has said a full-blown escalation of the trade dispute could decrease global gross domestic product by 0.81 percentage points.

"White House officials have revealed they can only hope Trump does not divulge sensitive secretsWhite House officials have revealed they can only hope Trump does not divulge sensitive secrets to his close friends when he speaks to them using the personal device. Trump, who has two official phones altered by the National Security Agency, is reportedly ignoring warnings from aides that his personal smartphone is not secure, The New York Times has reported. US intelligence agencies have cautioned Trump that Chinese spies have been listening in on his conversations and are exploiting the information they acquire as they navigate an ongoing trade dispute with the US. The Chinese reportedly plan to use the information to persuade Trump to adopt policies more in line with their own interests.Beijing hopes to influence Trump through the friends with whom they have heard him conversing. Two of those individuals are Stephen Schwarzman, the CEO of private equity firm Blackstone Group, and former casino mogul Steve Wynn.

The officials said US spy agencies had learned China and Russia were eavesdropping on Trumpâ€™s phone calls from sources inside foreign governments. They also intercepted communications between foreign officials, the individuals claimed.

"A trade war scenario of China thumbing its nose at U.S. dairy products could cost U.S. producers $3.4 billion a year and nearly 16,000 jobs over the next five years, according to a study released Monday by Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service.The good news: The recently announced U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement likely has saved U.S. dairyâ€™s top market, Mexico.Thatâ€™s key because Mexican imports of U.S. cheese alone are predicted to rise from $318 million in 2018 to more than $398 million by 2022 as Mexicans increasingly frequent U.S. restaurant chains and embrace U.S.-style foods. Canada is the second leading importer of U.S. dairy; China is the third.Researchers completed the study at the request of the National Milk Producers Federation in September, before the USMCA was announced as a trilateral replacement to the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. Loss of both the Mexican and Chinese export markets could have cost the U.S. dairy industry up to $6.58 billion a year and more than 32,000 workers.Texas is the nationâ€™s sixth leading producer of dairy, after California, Wisconsin, New York, Idaho and Pennsylvania; exporting $247 million worth of milk products, some 80 percent of which goes to Mexico.RELATED: After lengthy fight, oilfield landfill to be built near Texas town of NordheimCiting threats to national security, President Donald Trump in March announced worldwide tariffs on aluminum and steel and in May removed the exemption for trading partners including the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The tariffs prompted a slew of retaliatory duties on everything from apples to whiskey. Mexico enacted tariffs of 25 percent on imports of U.S. cheese; China put up tariffs on dairy products consisting mainly of whey, dry milk and cheese.Luis Ribera, an agricultural economist with the universityâ€™s Center for North American Studies, said that while the situation with Mexico â€œwas basically resolved,â€? producers still had reason to fear losing the Chinese market.The Chinese middle class has been growing, and with it the nationâ€™s appetites for dairy products including cheese and whey for use in baby formula. China in 2017 imported $577 million in dairy markets, making it the third leading market for U.S. dairy. Both the Mexican and Chinese dairy markets have fallen 42 percent since the Trump administration enacted the tariffs.Riberaâ€™s team weighed three scenarios.The first was a natural economics-at-play situation where shoppers in the two nations adjust to higher prices by buying less. Ribera likened it to a consumer faced with a 50 percent price hike for avocados making less guacamole and avocado toast but not foregoing the fruit completely.A second scenario mirrors what has already been seen, which is importers for political reasons either sourcing elsewhere or just stocking less of the commodity.RELATED: One of S.A.'s biggest developers talks how his career started at 16â€œIn China, it makes a lot of sense because itâ€™s centralized. So everything thatâ€™s imported, itâ€™s the government that has the decision,â€? Ribera said. â€œThatâ€™s what weâ€™re seeing basically with soybeans right now. Even though they need the soybeans, even though they cannot purchase more soybeans from Brazil, theyâ€™re still not trying to buy from the U.S.â€?In a third, and most dire, scenario, almost all of the two countriesâ€™ U.S. dairy imports are replaced by imports from competing places such as the New Zealand and the EU, which is expected to reach a free trade agreement with Mexico by 2020.â€œIt was basically we lost the market,â€? he said.lbrezosky@express-news.net",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The deer grazing on the soybeans across the road did not move much when we drove down the drive yesterday afternoon. She was standing in the shade of the woods for an early excursion into culinary Nirvana.Normally she would stay hidden until dusk, but the pull of the soybeans was too much for her.Deer love soybeansThey also love red clover, as anyone who used to plow at night with a cab tractor call tell you. In the dark ages, when we plowed sod, it was normal to work after dark with a whole herd of deer for company, sometimes almost close enough to pet.They had no fear of a man in a tractor cab. The genetic imprint of man-fear apparently only applied to man on foot. Man on a tractor had never killed them. Men in cars had, so they run from them.Canada geese love soybeans, also.Plant some near a pond and you discover something about geese you will wish you did not know. That is, they know exactly to the inch which plant is the nearest to the water. Take an aerial photo, get out a compass, and you will realize that you can draw a perfect semi-circle some distance from the pond to the edge of the denuded field.The shape never changes. The distance of the semi-circle from the water is only a function of how much time they have had to eat. Every other year I fed three acres of beans to the geese on one field I used to farm.Feeding wildlifeIf you farm, you feed wildlife. One farmer I used to go to church with brought some kind of venison meal to every church dinner. He lived in Pennsylvania and had a nuisance deer permit. I remember a farmer in Erie County, Pa., who had a lot of woods.He told me he and his friends shot over 100 deer one day. I suggested that would solve the problem for a while, but he said he could shoot that many more any day he wanted to. The good news for you this morning is that the deer are not costing you as much to feed as they were last month.That is as good as the news gets. The bad news is, prices are still plummeting on good weather and political export news. You know it is a bad day when the first item on the market letter from CHS is, â€œPresident Trump has announced another set of 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports late yesterday.â€?Since our biggest exports to China are farm products, once again the American farmer is paying the price for foreign relations. We are putting tariffs on high-tech items to try to limit the stealing of intellectual property.Chinese retaliationThe Chinese continue to retaliate by putting tariffs on our soybeans. A generation ago, President Jimmy Carter put limits on our ag trade in retaliation for â€œthe great Russian grain robbery.â€?This was actually a clever plan by the Russians to quietly buy a lot of wheat from every exporter at the same time.By the time the trade realized the extent of the purchases, a big price run-up was on. The real start to the ag trade wars actually was a Reagan-era attempt to limit soybean exports to Japan.This misguided policy was a result of rising soy and product prices here, which the non-livestock farmers thought was great. Sudden changes in trade policy never end well.The Japanese took a billion dollars to Brazil to start up soybean production, and the rest, as we say, is history. Now Brazil and Argentina export more soybeans than the U.S. does.In theory, the lastest soybean war will not change much.World marketSoybeans are a world market, and China will continue to use as many as ever, just not ours. Ours will go somewhere else. In practice, the short-term prices are corroded, and the Brazilians are inspired to increase production yet again.Add to the trade problems the current great weather across the Midwest, and you have corn prices down this Tuesday morning, June 19, another seven cents, beans off 22 cents.December corn futures are down more than 60 cents now in less than a month, with the new contract low overnight at 3.68.November soybean futures are off over $1.55 in the same time. USDA was expected to drop corn crop conditions to 76 percent good and excellent in the Monday report, but they reported 78 percent instead.The soybean condition was downgraded to 73 percent. That was off 1 percent, but still one of the great conditions reported in the last â€¦ forever. Also, the soybean crop planting is now virtually complete at 97 percent, against an average 91 percent.Ohio is at 95 percent, right on the average.

"COLUMBUS, Ohio â€” An Ohio farmer could lose more than half of his or her annual net income if China follows through with its own set of trade tariffs, which it vowed to do June 15, in response to $50 billion in tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.China has not said specifically what products will be targeted, but earlier this year suggested a 25 percent tariff on U.S. soybeans and other products.Researchers with Ohio State Universityâ€™s agriculture college have projected a 59 percent loss in annual net farm income based on historical trends in yields on corn and soybeans and projections for price drops in both commodities.The Chinese say they donâ€™t want a trade war â€” but given no choice â€” they will respond.â€œThe Chinese side doesnâ€™t want to fight a trade war, but facing the shortsightedness of the U.S. side, China has to fight back strongly,â€? the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement. â€œWe will immediately introduce the same scale and equal taxation measures, and all economic and trade achievements reached by the two sides will be invalidated.â€?Losing moneyAcross Ohio, the loss of soybean exports to China would be an estimated $241 million annually.â€œThere are farmers who are struggling across the state,â€? said Ben Brown, manager of the ag collegeâ€™s farm management program. â€œIf the proposed tariffs go into effect, weâ€™re going to have farmers who will have to exit the industry.â€?For the study, the researchers compiled data from six Ohio corn and soybean farms of similar size and created a representative Ohio farm comprised of 1,100 acres split evenly between corn and soybeans.They used the representative farm to determine the financial toll a tariff could take on an Ohio farm. Net annual income on that representative Ohio farm was projected to drop from $63,577 to $26,107 under the proposed tariff, according to the study, which was also conducted by OSU ag economist Ian Sheldon.Hurting farmersThe Ohio Soybean Association denounced the White Houseâ€™s action, predicting it would lead to signifcant losses to Ohioâ€™s farmers.â€œWe should address our trade challenges by increasing our competitiveness, not creating new barriers,â€? said Allen Armstrong, OSA president and Clark County soybean farmer. â€œExports have been one of the few bright spots for farmers in recent years, and we canâ€™t afford another hit to the bottom line.â€?Trumpâ€™s tariffs were imposed in response to complaints that Beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology. American officials say they target products that might benefit from Chinese industrial policies they say violate Beijingâ€™s free-trade commitments.The financial losses to farmers stem from an expected drop in Chinese demand for U.S. soybeans and corn and in the world price for both crops.â€œThe biggest impact will be on profits from soybeans, however, corn is affected too,â€? Brown said.Soybeans are Ohioâ€™s largest crop and the stateâ€™s top agricultural export. In April, China announced it would impose a 25 percent tariff on U.S. soybeans, corn and over 100 other American products, in response to the tariffs that the administration proposed on a range of Chinese imports valued at $50 billionOther countriesOther international trading partners, including Canada, the European Union, and Mexico, have recently announced retaliatory tariffs in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports as well, that could also dip into the profits of Ohio farmers.The losses from soybeans sales are projected to be far greater than for corn. Every year, 31 percent of the soybeans and 2 percent of the corn Ohio produces are exported to China. China is the largest buyer of soybeans in the world, and Brazil is its top supplier with the United States being second.â€œThe U.S. remains the largest producers of soybeans, but it is safe to say that Brazil could become the number one producer of soybeans in the world with increased demand for their products,â€? said Brown.Reduced exports. A study by Purdue University economists predicts that soybean exports to China could drop by as much as 65 percent if China imposes a retaliatory 25 percent tariff on U.S. soybeans.Davie Stephens, Kentucky soybean grower and vice president of ASA, is among growers distraught over the newly-announced tariffs, and Chinaâ€™s possible retaliation.â€œCrop prices have dropped 40 percent in the last five years, and farm income is down 50 percent compared to 2013. As a soy grower, I depend on trade with China. China imports roughly 60 percent of total U.S. soybean exports, representing nearly 1 in 3 rows of harvested soybeans,â€? Stephens said.The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has released a revised list of Chinese goods subject to the additional 25 percent tariff stemming from concerns over intellectual property theft and technology transfers. U.S. Customs and Border Protection will begin collecting the additional duties on the bulk of that list beginning July 6.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Singapore - Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticised the USâ€™s decision to brand the country as a 'strategic competitor,' dismissing the notion that it poses a threat to the worldâ€™s biggest economy.Wang told a briefing on the sidelines of Chinaâ€™s national legislative session on Thursday that the designation included in recent Trump administration national security documents was â€œfundamentally wrong.â€? The foreign minister said Beijing was committed to peaceful development, and greater cooperation was needed to address issues like trade and North Korea.'Although the â€˜China Threat Theoryâ€™ has now been reprinted, itâ€™s even less persuasive because facts speak louder than words,' Wang said, citing Chinaâ€™s economic growth and contributions to world peace at the United Nations.â€œAs long as we donâ€™t look with prejudice or double standards, what we can see is not a threat but fulsome opportunities. The so-called â€˜China Threat Theoryâ€™ can be laid to rest.'Concerns about the US-China rivalry has heated up as US President Donald Trump and his economic advisers prepare to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, while leaving open the possibility to exempting some allies.On Wednesday, Trump hinted that his restrictions on trade could run even deeper, citing Chinaâ€™s alleged theft of intellectual property.Trade war responseâ€œIf there is any competition between us, it has to be healthy and positive,â€? Wang said, in response to a question from Bloomberg News. â€œChina and US donâ€™t have to be rivals, but can be partners in competition.â€?The US is said to be considering clamping down on Chinese investment and imposing tariffs on a broad range of goods to punish Beijing over unfair intellectual-property practices as part of an ongoing US investigation ordered by Trump.In his remarks, Wang issued one of Chinaâ€™s most forceful responses yet to the looming trade actions.â€œA trade war is never the right solution,â€? Wang said. â€œIn a globalised world, it is particularly unhelpful, as it will harm both the initiator and the target countries. In the event of a trade war, China will make a justified and necessary response.â€?Meanwhile, the foreign minister said efforts to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table were at a â€œcrucial momentâ€? and urged both parties to work together.

"Analysts have said any such slowdown will also impact India, which witnessed economic growth touching a seven-quarter high of 7.7% in Q4FY18 and goods exports scaling a three-year peak last fiscal. (IE)Global economic growth could slow down by 1 percentage point â€” or more than a quarter of the expansion rates projected by various international bodies â€” if US President Donald Trumpâ€™s tariff threats against China and others escalate into a full-blown trade war, S&P Globalâ€™s chief economist cautioned on Monday. Speaking to CNBCâ€™s â€œSquawk Box Europeâ€?, Paul Gruenwald, chief economist at analytics firm S&P Global, said while it may not be a global recession but â€œone could imagine a scenario where rather than global growth in the threes we have global growth in the twos, where you get the US and Europe and China all pulling back at the same timeâ€?.Analysts have said any such slowdown will also impact India, which witnessed economic growth touching a seven-quarter high of 7.7% in Q4FY18 and goods exports scaling a three-year peak last fiscal.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted economic growth at 3.9% for 2018 and next year, against 3.8% in 2017. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, global GDP growth could inch up a tad in 2018 to 3.8%, compared with 3.7% in 2017.The threats of a trade war resurfaced late last month, as the US, after signalling a thaw, announced it was proceeding with plans to impose 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, sparking angry reaction from Beijing that threatened retaliatory action.Last Thursday, the US hit some of its closest allies, slapping tariffs on steel and aluminium from Europe, Mexico and Canada, after initially exempting them from this tax that is also applicable to supplies from countries like India. Consequently, at a meeting of the finance ministers of G-7 nations last Friday, the US had to face attack by these countries that also sought to retaliate and mount challenges with the World Trade Organisation (WTO). India has already dragged the US to the WTO over duties on steel (25%) and aluminium (10%). Commerce minister Suresh Prabhu is visiting the US next week to flag Indiaâ€™s concerns.The IMF had in April raised its forecasts of global trade by a decent 50 basis points for 2018 from the level it expected in January, but it flagged risks from â€œinward-looking policiesâ€? of some countries. The WTO, too, anticipates merchandise trade volume growth to drop to 4.4% in 2018 and 4% in 2019, from 4.7% in 2017. The growth rate is below the average rate of 4.8%. It warned of signs that â€œescalating trade tensions may already be affecting business confidence and investment decisions, which could compromise the current outlookâ€?.Even staff simulations by the European Central Bank pointed out in April that global growth could contract by up to 1 percentage point in the first year after the tariff changes and world trade in goods could shrink by up to 3 percentage points.After witnessing a fall on last Thursday, Asian stock markets on Monday picked up from a strong close on the positive US payroll numbers released on Friday, and are currently at a two-and-a-half-year high.Trump had initially threatened tariffs on up to $150 billion worth of Chinese goods, citing Beijingâ€™s unfair commercial practices.China, which, too, had threatened to retaliate by raising duties on US goods worth $50 billion, is in negotiations with the US, without any concrete results so far.

Ma was speaking at an Alibaba investor conference hours after Washington said it would impose duties on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, drawing a warning from Beijing that it would retaliate.Ma said trade tensions would likely impact Chinese and foreign companies immediately and negatively. He predicted that Chinese businesses would move production to other countries in the medium-term to get around the tariffs. â€œYou may win the battle, but you lose the war,â€? Ma said at the shareholder event in Hangzhou.â€œMiddle term, a lot of Chinese business will move to other countries,â€? he added. Ma said new trade rules were needed over the longterm. â€œEven if Donald Trump retired, the new president will come, it will still continueâ€¦We need new trade rules, we need to upgrade the WTO,â€? he said, referring to the World Trade Organization.Ma made the comments in what he said was his last speech to shareholders as chairman of the Chinese internet giant.

It is an unusually rapid move for a trade case, coming less than one week after the US Trade Representative announced the tariff plan, which wouldnâ€™t take effect until at least September.The USTR said last week that it proposed the levy in response to Beijingâ€™s decision to retaliate for US tariff hikes over complaints China is hurting American companies by stealing or pressuring foreign enterprises to hand over technology. China criticised the move but has yet to say whether it would retaliate for the second round of tariffs.Its lopsided trade balance with the United States means it has only USD 80 billion of annual imports of American goods left for retaliation following its earlier measures.

"â€œOne obvious threat would be Trumpâ€™s threat, if followed through on to impose 20-25% tariff on global auto imports,â€? Chris Wood said.Even as we continue to see developments around the trade war, with the Donald Trump administration imposing heavy tariffs on Chinese imports, CLSAâ€™s Chris Wood says that the tariff war escalation will impact the auto industry. â€œOne obvious threat would be Trumpâ€™s threat, if followed through on to impose 20-25% tariff on global auto imports. Such a move would almost certainly trigger retaliation in the auto industry and cause renewed focus on the peaking out of globalisation and retreat from Pax Americana,â€? Chris Wood said in CLSAâ€™s Greed and Fear report.Notably, earlier this week, the US administration threatened to impose 10% tariffs on another $200bn (Â£151bn) worth of Chinese imports, which was immediately met by Beijingâ€™s pledge to take â€œfirm and forceful measuresâ€? to retaliate.While the emerging markets continue to feel the pressure of a rising US Dollar, Wood noted recently that conditions are becoming difficult for emerging market (EM) investors. Chris Wood said that US monetary tightening expectations have increased.â€œThe dovish stance of ECB (European Central Bank) and Bank of Japan continues,â€? he noted.

"US President Donald Trump (Reuters)The Trump administration on Tuesday said it will use a Great Depression-era programme to pay up to $12 billion to help US farmers weather a growing trade war with China, the European Union and others that the president began.It is a clear signal the US. President Donald Trump is determined to stick with tariffs as his weapon of choice in the conflict.The move meant to cushion the blow for a politically important constituency was met with broad criticism by many farmers and farm-belt lawmakers, including Republicans. Rural and agricultural states supported Trump by wide margins in the 2016 election.Trumpâ€™s trade policies have become central in several rural-state U.S. Senate races ahead of congressional elections in November.The president, speaking at an event in Kansas City on Tuesday, reaffirmed his support for tariffs and pledged that â€œfarmers will be the biggest beneficiary.â€?â€œJust be a little patient,â€? Trump said.The relief package is intended as a temporary boost to farmers as the United States and China negotiate over trade issues, officials said.â€œThis obviously is a short-term solution that will give President Trump time to work on a long-term trade policy,â€? said Sonny Perdue, the secretary of the US Department of Agriculture.The aid will be financed through the USDAâ€™s Commodity Credit Corporation and will not require congressional approval, Perdue said.The administrationâ€™s action appeared to divide Republicans, with some praising the move and others troubled by what they view as the kind of widespread government-assistance program their party has traditionally opposed.â€œThis trade war is cutting the legs out from under farmers and the White Houseâ€™s â€˜planâ€™ is to spend $12 billion on gold crutches,â€? said Senator Ben Sasse, of Nebraska who frequently criticizes the president, a fellow Republican.Farmers have been a particular target in the current clash over trade policy as other countries seek to retaliate for Trumpâ€™s duties on Chinese goods as well as on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico. Those affected economies have in turn targeted U.S. agricultural products, including soybeans, dairy, meat, produce and liquor.The United States exported $138 billion in agriculture products in 2017, including $21.5 billion of soybeans, the most valuable export. China alone imported $12.3 billion of U.S. soybeans last year, according to the USDA.The size of the direct payments to farmers as a result of trade shortfalls would be unprecedented, said Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois.â€œWe have never compensated farmers directly on such a large scale for retaliatory tariffs,â€? Irwin said.The news lifted shares of farm equipment companies on the prospect that farmers will have more money to spend on tractors and other farm gear.Deere & Co jumped 3.1 percent, while Caterpillar Inc gained more than 1 percent and AGCO Corp rose 0.6 percent.Stock options trading in Deere and Caterpillar also saw a burst of activity in the 30 minutes before the news broke, according to a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data. Some of those contracts more than doubled in price after word of the pending plan broke in a Politico report.Options activity has been known to spike before the public announcement of market-moving news and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has pursued enforcement actions when the activity has been determined to be insider trading involving options. There was no immediate indication that Tuesdayâ€™s volume increases were anything other than coincidental.Soybean futures, driven to a 10-year low in part by Chinaâ€™s retaliatory tariffs, rose 1.2 percent and hit their highest in two weeks as traders bet farm aid would improve demand, reducing a current surplus supply.Still, Blake Hurst, a corn and soybean farmer and president of the Missouri Farm Bureau, said that unless the White Houseâ€™s policies change, the U.S. agriculture industry will continue to suffer.â€œThe payments will be helpful to farmers facing overdue loans and angry bankers, but are completely insufficient if they mean that tariffs and the trade war will last for the foreseeable future,â€? Hurst said. â€œThey are a very temporary bandage to a self-inflicted wound.â€?Some members of Trumpâ€™s own party agreed.â€œTariffs are taxes that punish American consumers and producers,â€? Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul wrote on Twitter https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/1021791878663090177. â€œIf tariffs punish farmers, the answer is not welfare for farmers â€” the answer is remove the tariffs.â€?Kevin Cramer, a U.S. representative trying to unseat Democrat Senator Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, praised the move.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mumbai: Even though the group has a diversified presence across the globe which acts as a hedge, the current spate of tariff wars between the two largest economies have impacted the Aditya Birla group's business in the US, chairman Kumarmangalam Birla said on Tuesday and warned of more dumping by Chinese in the domestic market. He said the domestic market can expect a lot of Chinese dumping, as they will be unable to find a market in the US because of the heavy duties.'For the first time because of these tariff wars, there is some sort of impact on our business in the US,' Birla said speaking at the third Bloomberg India Economic Forum on Tuesday evening.The group draws a considerable portion of its metals (aluminium business from its US subsidiary Novelis).He made the comments while answering a question on bureaucratic troubles faced by companies, in which he said there is far too less need for meeting government officials while operating in the US compared to India, even though a lot of work on ease of doing business has happened under the present government.Earlier, he said either by design or inadvertently, businesses of his group are spread across geographies which acts as a natural hedge in periods of bad times like the ongoing tariff wars between the US and China.He said the group has presence in the US, South America and Europe which acts as the hedge.Citing aluminium, on which the US has imposed a 25 percent duty on Chinese imports, he said a lot of the products will not be able to go to the US and may end up here where the consumption story is still strong.'I see there is some risk in terms of Chinese goods coming into the economy,' he said.It can be noted that over the past few months, the Donald Trump administration has upped the ante on tariffs, seeking what it calls fair trade and reciprocity from its partners mainly China, which is the world's largest exporter, and thus one of the prime targets of these measures, more of which are due next week.Birla said he hopes for normalcy to return at the earliest and that the trade wars do not last long. He, however, said the Indian growth story will not be affected because of the trade wars.'A lot of our growth is propelled by domestic consumption and not much by exports,' he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Beijing: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is due to visit Beijing next week amid tensions over trade and China's territorial claims in the South China Sea. China's foreign ministry announced Pompeo will visit on Monday for consultations on bilateral and international issues. The ministry gave no details, but based on previous visits by American secretaries of state, he would be likely to meet with China's foreign minister, senior foreign policy advisers and President Xi Jinping.The visit comes as the US administration is accusing China of trying to undermine President Donald Trump, who accused China during a meeting of the UN Security Council of interfering in American elections to help his Democratic rivals.'They do not want me, or us, to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade,' Trump said, later referencing as evidence an advertising insert in The Des Moines Register paid for by Chinese government-affiliated entities.Since Trump took office last year, his administration has escalated pressure on China, most recently with several rounds of tit-for-tat economic trade tariffs on hundreds of billions in goods. Trump's first national security strategy released last year also labelled China a 'revisionist power' alongside Russia.Additionally, ties have worsened in recent weeks with a US decision to issue economic sanctions over the purchase of Russian fighter jets and surface-to-air missile equipment.In response, China summoned the American ambassador and defence attache to deliver a protest and recalled its navy commander from a US trip.US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has since dropped plans to visit China in October for talks.Meanwhile, a Chinese destroyer came aggressively close to a US Navy ship in the South China Sea, forcing it to manoeuvre to prevent a collision, the US Pacific Fleet said Tuesday. The Chinese warship approached the USS Decatur in an 'unsafe and unprofessional manoeuvre' on Sunday near Gaven Reefs in the South China Sea, said US Pacific Fleet Spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Tim Gorman. At one point, the ships were within 40 meters (131 feet) of each other.China claims most of the strategic waterway and has built islands on reefs and equipped them with military facilities such as airstrips, radar domes and missile systems.The Chinese defence ministry said Tuesday it opposes the US warship's entry into the waters 'around China's islands and reefs.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SEAFOOD companies in the United States are waiting anxiously this week to see what impact the growing trade war between Washington and Beijing will have on their businesses.US tariffs totalling $34 billion on Chinese goods have just come into effect. China immediately hit back, imposing 25 per cent tariffs on US exports, including some types of fish and seafood.However, seafood sent for processing, as long as it is re-exported back to the US or elsewhere, is exempt. Some fishmeal products will also escape.But a lot of American companies, especially those in Alaska, the largest fishing state in the US, sell directly into China and they are expecting to be hit.Furthermore, it puts them at a competitive disadvantage to rival seafood exporting countries such as Norway and Russia.But some trade analysts in Oslo fear that if the trade war escalates further it could eventually impact on Norwegian salmon exports to the US.In the last few weeks, the US seafood industry has pleaded with President Donald Trump to avoid a trade war at all costs, but the plea seems to have fallen on deaf ears. Beijing has accused the US of triggering the largest trade war in economic history.Lu Kang, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, said: â€˜After the US activated its tariff measures against China, Chinaâ€™s measures against the US took effect immediately.â€™China is a big market for Alaska, worth up to a billion dollars a year, with half of that figure being sent directly to China for home consumption.Consultant Garrett Evridge, who works closely with the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, believes the potential damage impact is difficult to guess at this stage, but he added that the situation was worrying.Picture: President Trump â€“ trade warsShare this: SharePrintFacebookLinkedInRelated Posts:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DEMOCRATS in the US Congress are urging President Donald Trump to pay compensation to fishermen affected by the trade war with China.The tariff dispute is already badly affecting fishermen in Alaska where China is one of their biggest overseas markets, but there are also reports that the Maine lobster industry is starting to suffer. Maine lobster fishermen are worried that they will permanently lose trade to neighbours Canada which also sells into China. It is now more than a week since Beijing imposed a 25 per cent retaliatory tariff on many types of US seafood.Trump has already said he plans to provide $12-billion in help to US farmers, but now a group of US Democrats are urging him to increase the aid budget to include fishermen.The maintain that US Federal law allows the government to offer help to fishermen who lose out due to natural disasters or main-made actions. Accordingly, Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts has proposed a Bill which expands the disaster definition to include the tariffs imposed by China on US seafood imports. He said farmers were not the only group losing out in the current trade war.He and other Democrats have written to Trump saying: â€œWe respectfully request you give the same consideration to the hardworking fishermen and women of America who are being hurt by your policies and direct the U.S. Department of Commerce to provide emergency assistance to working families of the water.â€?And it is not just Democrats who are calling for action. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska has issued a statement calling the aid to farmers an admission that tariffs were hurting, not helping the country and said American fishermen were also being caught up in the dispute.Share this: SharePrintFacebookLinkedInRelated Posts:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THE National Fisheries Institute in the United States is turning its official website into a jobs information hub because of the threat to employment posed by President Trumpâ€™s tariff-led trade war with China.The website (AboutSeafood.com) now features video testimony from every aspect of the seafood workforce.It explores the reality of tariffs on real American jobs, from fishmongers and truck drivers, to lobstermen, manufacturing workers and chefs.The Institute says: â€˜In recognition of the threat to the seafood community posed by new trade tariffs, the National Fisheries Institute (NFI) has rebranded its AboutSeafood.com website to support the stories of American seafood workers.â€™The effort is all part of its â€˜See Jobs campaignâ€™ and the site will be regularly updated with new videos.NFI president John Connelly said: â€˜To understand the negative impact these tariffs will have on American workers you have to go see them, you have to talk to them, you have to hear their concerns.â€˜Weâ€™re bringing those stories to policy makers so they understand; this is not a theoretical, economic chess game.â€˜These tariffs have the potential to do a lot of harm to the seafood community and that communityâ€™s jobs are right here in the US.â€™He said the US cannot simply make more seafood and process it at home. While US waters were some of the best managed in the world, they were being fished to their sustainable limits.â€˜To feed Americans, the seafood community must source seafood from countries around the globe, even as US harvesters tap global markets to sell their catch,â€™ Connelly added.â€˜Whatâ€™s more, the raw product that comes from valued global trading partners is the fuel that drives jobs in the US.â€˜This is not a situation where the raw imported product is taking jobs away from American workers but just the opposite.â€˜It is the material that keeps them viable. Jobs in processing, portioning, value adding, storing, delivering and serving all depend on seafood imports.â€™Share this: SharePrintFacebookLinkedInRelated Posts:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by PRINTUS LeBLANC || Last week the Trump administration announced it would impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum. Many in the media and were quick to lose their mind as usual. Before judging President Donald Trumpâ€™s actions, those criticizing should look at the real world instead of the utopian society they want to live in. In the real-world trade is used as a weapon and it is time the U.S. wake up to that reality.A 2014 White Paper from U.S. Army Special Operations Command on Unconventional Warfare discusses different methods of warfare being used by various adversaries. With regards to China, it states, â€œChina will use a host of methods, many of which lie out of the realm of conventional warfare. These methods include trade warfare, financial warfare, ecological warfare, psychological warfare, smuggling warfare, media warfare, drug warfare, network warfare, technological warfare, fabrication warfare, resources warfare, economic aid warfare, cultural warfare, and international law warfare.â€?This is more than abstract theory. There is actual recent historical evidence to prove nations use trade and economic warfare to accomplish a goal.The U.S. and Saudi Arabia used the oil trade as a weapon against the U.S.S.R. in the 1980â€™s. The Soviets, as the Russians are today, were wholly dependent upon revenue from the fossil fuel industry to fund the government. President Reaganâ€™s administration issued National Security Decision Directive 66 (NSDD-66) titled East-West Economic Relations & Poland-Related Sanctions. The actions targeted included:No new contracts to buy Soviet natural gas;Accelerate development of an alternate supply to Soviet gas for parts of Europe;A plan to substantially raise interest rates on credit to the U.S.S.R; andThe requirement of higher down payments and shorter maturities on Russian bonds.Officials calculated that for every $1/barrel drop in the price of oil, it would cost the Soviets between $500 million and $1 billion in lost revenue. At the time the price of oil was in the mid $30s, and a drop below $20/barrel would have a catastrophic impact on the Soviet economy. In 1986, the price of oil dropped down to $12/barrel, and we know what happened to the Soviet Union after that. Oil would not get back above $20/barrel until Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.Rare Earth Elements (REEs) are another example of trade being used as a weapon. The group of 17 elements with unusual properties is key to modern life. It is impossible to find technology that does not have one of these elements in them. Everything from light bulbs and windmills to LED screens and cell phones have REEs in them.The U.S. military enjoys an immense technological advantage against any foe it goes up against, and that technology has an Achillesâ€™ heel, REEs. Writing for Breaking Defense, Richard Whittle noted the importance of REEs in the defense industrial base:Each nuclear-powered SSN-774 Virginia-class fast attack submarine requires about 9,200 pounds of REEs;Each DDG-51 Aegis destroyer needs about 5,200 pounds;Each F-35 Joint Strike fighter needs about 920 pounds; andREEs are also essential to precision-guided munitions, lasers, satellite communications, radar, sonar and other military equipment.As important as these elements are, the production of REEs is controlled by one country and has been used as an economic weapon recently. China produces more than 90 percent of all REEs used today. In a dispute over uninhabited islands that resulted in Japanese detention of a Chinese fishing captain, China halted shipments of REEs to Japan. The action sent a shock wave around the world. Suddenly, China had the power to bring the economy of a foreign power to a grinding halt.After years of disputes in the WTO over the actions, China decided to flood the market with REEs. Flooding the market with cheap REEs ensured no other mines in the world could compete with China, including a U.S. mine, Mountain Pass mine owned by Molycorp, that would go bankrupt in June of 2015. China now controls the rare earth market.China was able to turn an industry valued at $4.3 billion in 2012, expected to reach $10.9 billion in 2020, and turn it into the base for its technology manufacturing industry, valued at $4.8 trillion. China was also able to demand the manufacture of products with REE components be relocated to China along with the transfer of Intellectual Property (IP). China did not get to be the second largest economy in the world by obeying the rules. China used trade warfare, and lawfare to rival the U.S. and the least policymakers can do is recognize that.These are just two recent examples of trade warfare. It is a tactic that has been used since the beginning of time. Those complaining about what the administration did should study history. It is impossible to have a conversation about the issue if both sides cannot even admit that trade has been used as a weapon in the past. Obviously, no one wants a trade war, but how do you know the other side isnâ€™t in a trade war already?Printus LeBlanc is a contributing editor at Americans for Limited Government.

"article 3 months oldInternational | Apr 17 2018By Mark Tinker, Head of AXA IM Framlington Equities AsiaTrade War talk obscures a fundamental shift to a multi-polar world.Trade relationships are having to be resetTrade tension is being blamed for what is essentially a â€˜normalâ€™ market correction. It is not irrelevant, but it is the new economy that is more important. As last year, Xi has made important concessions on access, without appearing to do so.Chinaâ€™s capital markets continue to open up with a huge increase in daily stock connect quotas, a stock connect with London, the ability of foreigners to own asset management businesses and the restart of the QDII quota system all announced in the last few days.Geo-Political Tension over Syria is also a repeat of a year ago, we have to hope it fades in a similar fashion. Meanwhile Libor is literally double the levels of last April promoting further deleveraging.Almost exactly this time last year we were facing military tension in the Gulf and threats of a trade war in Asia, so we have something of a sense of deja vue at the moment. In this instance I believe that we are seeing a fundamental re-set of the post WWll trading era, to recognise the role of China. A new â€œNew World Orderâ€™ if you like.The market behaviour in Q2 continues to be one of de-risking and it is clear that the noise traders who came so enthusiastically into equity markets around the turn of the calendar year have gone again before the start of the new financial year, taking their leverage with them. This may be evident from the way that Emerging Markets, though most sensitive to the supposed cause of the correction, the threat of Trade Wars, have actually outperformed the US equity market over this period. It is also evident from the way that stocks owned in leveraged ETFs have been affected. For example, when we look at the [US] energy sector ETF, XLE, we see a rush of enthusiasm between mid-December and mid-January and a jump of almost 15% in the price before it all disappeared practically overnight in the early February volatility spike. Naturally ERX US, the three times leveraged ETF that tracks the energy sector index was a multiple of that â€“ approximately plus and then minus 40%. In a similar fashion, FAS, the three times leveraged financials ETF rallied over 20% and then lost it all. Encouragingly, the last week or so has seen much greater stability across the board and most if not all sectors and markets remain sound from a technical perspective.The other factor behind the deleveraging in the financial markets is a simple one. Price. As we have noted many times, the cost of money as a raw material for financial products as proxied by Libor has doubled over the last 12 months. With the US yield curve all but flat out to 5 years â€“ at 27bp the spread between libor and 5 year bonds is not far from the lows seen in the 2012 â€“ the opportunity for simple carry and spread trades has shrunk, especially compared to the 2013-15 period where it was around 130-150bp. Similarly the spread out to 2 years is now negative. Some people are making a lot of the notion that a flat yield curve is a lead indicator of a recession, but I would argue that those models canâ€™t really properly take account of the unusual era of QE we have been living through. Having said that, countries with consumer borrowing rates tied to libor will have seen (and continue to see) pressure on the disposable income/cash flow of households and companies with floating rate debt. Strong balance sheets and sensible balance sheet management are already coming into focus.The market needs a good narrative and concern over trade wars provides something suitable, but it is not as if trade tensions between the US and China are anything new, indeed it was one of the dominant talking points of q1 last year, until calmed down by the discussions between Presidents Xi and Trump almost exactly a year ago, after which China made a number of concessions on access for US financial services and agreed to import more of the USâ€™s latest key product, LNG. The short history so far suggests that President Trump is using trade and the threat of sanctions, in effect Americaâ€™s economic power, in order to obtain what he regards as a better deal for America in its relations with the rest of the world. As a deal maker his opening statements will always take an aggressive position, hence the expression from a year ago that we should take him seriously, but not literally and it seems that the markets, if not necessarily many in the media, are doing just that. The recent announcements on steel and Aluminium for example make a lot more sense when viewed as part of a coercion strategy to get Mexico and Canada, who were far more affected than China, to push through a re-negotiation of NAFTA as well as South Korea to agree a new bi-lateral agreement. Interestingly the US has acknowledged that it may well re-join the TPP if conditions are right and made its statement on Steel and Aluminium literally a few hours after the TPP â€“ 11 (i.e. not including the US) made a number of breakthroughs on service industry related issues at its recent summit in Peru.Indeed as I write this I hear that President Trump is calling for his economic advisers to revisit TPP. This is about acknowledging it is no longer a unipolar world and trying to line up as many countries behind â€˜your teamâ€™. Itâ€™s a grand reset. The benefits of specialisation and trade are one of the things that almost all economists agree upon, although not necessarily all politicians do and of course the upcoming US mid-term elections certainly have a role to play in all this. However, in my view much of this is about geo-politics rather than domestic politics. For example, trade pressure from the US in turn reportedly produced trade pressure from China that appears to have brought North Korea to the meeting table, while trade pressure on Europe and others is being shaped to try and ensure that it is America, rather than China that â€˜sets the rulesâ€™, not so much for the old economy of steel and aluminium, but for the new economy of fintech, cloud computing, AI, biotech and autonomous driving. China has set out its aims to excel in these areas in its â€˜Made in China 2025â€™ strategy but as President Trumpâ€™s new Trade advisor Peter Navarro pointed out in an Op-ed in the media this week, if China â€œcaptures these industries, the US simply will not have an economic futureâ€?. This is the heart of the issue, that the US wants the fourth industrial revolution and the â€˜internet of thingsâ€™ to be American, not Chinese. In practical terms, what the US also really wants is greater access to the Chinese Consumer and the giant US multi-nationals who used to fight off the protectionist tendencies of US politicians are no longer doing so, recognising that they need an aggressive US trade stance to wring concessions from the Chinese.While the noise traders try and play currencies, commodities and â€˜thematic stocksâ€™ like steel and shipping, as equity investors we find that If we listen carefully we can already hear the rhetoric has shifted to tech and services. Importantly the Chinese authorities are more than aware of this and we have already seen from recent statements that the process of opening up access to certain Chinese markets will continue. Xiâ€™s comments this week, in my view are a classic example of this; a concession without appearing to concede. There are promises of more to be done on financial services, autos and IP protection. The latter is interesting because a big part of recent US complaints about China is the theft of Intellectual property, but this is to confuse invention with innovation. The idea of patents is to allow those that invent something to benefit from doing so â€“ and thus encourage invention. They should not however be used to prevent innovation, the second stage of the process whereupon a different set of actors â€“ in this case entrepreneurs rather than inventors â€“ take the original idea and modify it to suit consumer needs. None of these are really concessions, they were already happening, the high profile rhetoric has simply ensured that it continues to do so. Moreover, the concessions such as they are, are all for the benefit of the Chinese consumer rather than the producer.China clearly no longer feels the need to protect certain industries from competition, the classic case for emerging industries in emerging markets, but while providing access they are not necessarily going to provide instant profits for western companies. It is likely that it will be no easier for a US financial corporation to â€˜break intoâ€™ China than it is for a European to break into the US. Non trade barriers outside of the WTO rules abound, as they have done for years so we should be careful about getting too carried away. As I pointed out to some US government economists in Beijing recently, the reason why third party countries will more willingly accept Union Pay than MasterCard or Visa is the same reason they currently accept American Express; itâ€™s the preferred choice of the consumer with the most money. As to who will benefit most from the burgeoning Chinese consumer, well we would suggest that will be the investor who picks the best companies, regardless of where they are quoted.For investors a move to a multi polar world is actually a good thing not least from a diversification point of view. We are seeing increasing interest from clients globally in how, rather than why, they should invest in Chinese companies and about how the capital markets are opening up and there was yet more positive news on that front this week from multiple directions. Diversification works both ways of course and we saw an announcement by SAFE, who manage the Chinese foreign exchange reserves, about the restart of the QDII quota system after it had been suspended for the last three years. Essentially this is quota in US$, in this case $90bn or so, that can be invested overseas. Meanwhile the PBOC announced a Shanghaiâ€“London stock connect link would be operational by the end of the year. In terms of inflows, this came on the same day that the PBOC announced that foreign investors would be allowed to take majority stakes in fund management, securities and life insurance companies, while the Hong Kong Exchange announced a significant expansion in the size of the daily limit for the Hong Kong Shanghai and Shenzhen stock connects. Approved by the mainland and Hong Kong regulators, the Northbound daily quota will increase from RMB13bn to Rmb52bn and Southbound from Rmb 10.5bn to Rmb42bn.One other interesting development over the last few weeks has been the launch of an oil futures contract in China traded in RMB. This has been discussed before and particularly the notion that as the worldâ€™s largest importer of oil, China may ask its two biggest suppliers â€“ Russia and Angola â€“ to accept payments in RMB. The fact that neither might have sufficient interest in RMB purchases could be dealt with by passing the RMB contracts through to gold, which ultimately threatens the status of the petro dollar. Be careful what you wish for as they say and those insisting on an immediate full convertibility of the RMB may find themselves worrying about the USD losing its reserve currency status and all the privilege that goes with that.Conclusion. Recent market moves are not really about Trade tariffs, but that is not to say they are not important. In fact they are highlighting very important economic and political â€˜re-setting.â€™ With political power consolidated, Xi is moving back to economic and financial reform. The trade pressure from America is notionally aimed at China but is really about adjusting the post War US centric trading system to account for the emergence of China while seeking to pull the â€˜rest of the worldâ€™ in behind America. The policy of made in China 2025 is the key focus of US concern, China has moved too rapidly up the value added chain for comfort as far as many western corporations are concerned and policy is being aimed at both gaining access to Chinese consumers and trying to shut increasingly sophisticated Chinese producers out of lucrative third party markets. In response China is making concessions on market access, but in my view only where they suit China. Where there are strong domestic players established â€“ autos and finance for example, they are increasingly allowing foreign access, recognising that competition is good for the end consumer. Just in the last week announcements about changes to the size of the Hong Kong stock connects, opening up outbound quota again, building a stock connect with London, allowing foreign ownership of asset management firm illustrates the speed and scope of the changes coming. The winners and (losers) of this newly emerging â€˜world orderâ€™ will be geographically diverse, both in their headquarters and their listings and in our view investors will be far better served by taking an active bottom up approach in constructing portfolios to capture the winners and just as important avoid the losers.Content included in this article is not by association the view of FNArena (see our disclaimer).About AXA Investment ManagersAXA Investment Managers (AXA IM) is an active, long-term, global multi-asset investor.

"For an indication of what might happen, itâ€™s worth looking at other countries that have faced the wrath of Chinaâ€™s so-called â€œdiplomatic sanctionsâ€?.South Korea and Japan, for example, have seen how their businesses in China have been hurt as a part of their disputes with the country.Following Seoulâ€™s decision to deploy an anti-missile system that China strenuously objects to, major Korean retailer Lotte was forced to suspend operations at many hypermarkets after Beijing claimed they had violated fire-safety rules. Lotte continues to suffer losses as, having pulled out of China, it is unable to sell many of its units. According to the Yonhap news agency, it lost an estimated KRW2tr (US$1.8bn) in the year from March 2017.On Japanâ€™s part, its automakers endured crushing losses in sales to China in the midst of a dispute over the sovereignty of islands in the East China Sea, due to a boycott allegedly organised by central authorities in Beijing.Like Hyundai in Koreaâ€™s spat, having been shunned in China since last year, the governmentâ€™s propaganda wing was supposedly behind a public embargo of the likes of Toyota and Nissan vehicles.With many multiples of assets in China, compared to Chinaâ€™s assets in the US, and relative sales between the two countries, America has much more to lose than its trade rival, should President Xi Jinping decide to play hardball.According to a recent report by China International Capital, American businesses had US$627bn in assets and US$482bn in sales in China in 2015, compared to just US$167bn in US assets and US$26Bn in sales for Chinese companies,Feeling the heatWhile the automotive industryâ€”again a natural victim with carmakers like General Motors and Tesla viewing China as a bountiful marketâ€”are jittery about the future, food and beverage companies are also feeling the heat.For coffee chain Starbucks, China was a standout market last year, posting 7% same-store sales growth, making it the companyâ€™s second-most important territory. This year, it is expecting to accelerate store openings, with the aim of adding 600 new outlets a year to reach 6,000 by 2022.But store sales dropped by 2% last quarter, and the company is especially exposed to any government sanctions as it owns most of its outlets in China, where it rarely sells franchise rights.Likewise, McDonaldâ€™s has been seeing a drop in customer visits after booming for the last two decades. Its decision to sell off its China division to an investor group last year for US$1.7bn could shield it from Chinese retaliation to Americaâ€™s trade policy, but the company still retains a 20% stake in the business.Perhaps the American names facing the biggest risk are KFC and Pizza Hut, which is owned by Yum! China Holdings, a Chinese spin-off from its US parent, Yum! Brands. As owner of the biggest network of fast-food restaurants in China, it has seen a dramatic downturn in the last few years, and was the target of anti-US protests in China two years ago.Pressure from the government would add to Yum! Chinaâ€™s problems, with Pizza Hut struggling and KFC unexpectedly seeing flat sales last quarter as domestic chains and healthier options grow in popularity among younger customers. Pressure from Beijing might well push a rumoured takeover bid by Chinese funds to take place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you are an actual business leader, and not a real estate speculator pretending to be one, you probably know that trade wars are neither â€œgoodâ€? nor â€œeasy to win.â€? In fact, history proves just the opposite. And since the United States just fired the opening salvo in what many observers fear could be a big trade war, itâ€™s probably a good time to ask yourself what this means for your company.If your business does not rely on imported steel or aluminum, you might be tempted to answer, â€œNot much.â€? But if you do, youâ€™re probably not thinking hard enough. And youâ€™ve probably forgotten that a tariff imposed on U.S. chickens by France and West Germany back in the early 1960s is still creating major headaches for automakers from Detroit to DÃ¼sseldorf.Playing ChickenThe switch to factory farming in the United States after World War II transformed chicken from a luxury food to a mass-produced commodity. Once American poultry companies had satisfied the domestic demand, they started shipping their surplus boilers and fryers across the Atlantic.Soon, European chicken farmers were crying foul.As the price of poultry plummeted across the newly formed Common Market, European countries established price controls. France was the first to impose tariffs on U.S. chickens, but West Germany soon followed. American chicken exports fell so precipitously that some U.S. politicians threatened to pull U.S. troops out of Europe.Instead, the United States decided to retaliate economically.In 1963, President Lyndon Johnson imposed a 25 percent tariff on potato starch, dextrin, brandy and light trucks. What did these products have to do with chicken? Nothing. But they were all imported from Europe in large quantities â€” at least in the early 1960s. And the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade allowed countries to increase taxes on unrelated imports to an equal amount to losses from unfair trade.The brandy tax hit the French hard, and the tariffs imposed on light truck were aimed squarely at the German automobile industry, which was making big inroads into the U.S. market with an array of innovative and economical small vans and pickups.The American strategy worked. Volkswagen AGâ€™s pickup and van business collapsed in the United States, and demand for French brandy began to dry up.But the Europeans were not the only ones who suffered.Unintended ConsequencesJapanese automakers were also hit hard by the tariffs on light trucks, even though their nationâ€™s roosters were not party to this cockfight.The 25 percent tax made small pickups produced by the likes of Toyota and Isuzu uncompetitive versus those produced by U.S. manufacturers, and that prompted the American automobile industry to lobby successfully for the continuation of the so-called chicken tax long after the poultry battle was over.And so it remained in effect. But this, too, had unintended consequences for those same Detroit automakers.The Japanese found ways around the chicken tax. They began importing truck chassis and adding the beds to them after they were offloaded in the United States. Later, as demand for their superior products grew, they decided it was more cost-effective just to build the pickups in America, and so constructed their own U.S. factories.By the early 2000s, Detroit was falling victim to the chicken tax itself.As Japanese automakers began to dominate the small truck market with domestically produced pickups, their American rivals struggled to match them. But uncompetitive labor agreements prevented General Motors, Ford and Chrysler from profitably producing small trucks in the United States. They were forced to cut corners, and customers could tell, so their sales slumped.General Motors and Chrysler began importing small trucks from Mexico and Canada, which were exempted from the chicken tax by the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.Ford faced a bigger challenge. While it produced some of the best light trucks in the world, it produced them in places such as Thailand and Turkey. Importing them to the United States would have made them too expensive to compete.So, Ford took a page from the Japanese playbook.It started importing small commercial vans from Turkey as passenger vehicles, equipping them with rear seats, seatbelts and windows, then removing this equipment after the vehicles were landed in the United States and reconverting them to commercial vehicles.It was a costly kabuki dance, but still cheaper than paying the chicken tax. At least for Ford.Consumers continue to pay more for their pickups than they would without the chicken tax, as they have for decades.Neither Easy nor GoodThese are just some of the ways in which a trade war sparked by poultry tariffs in the mid-twentieth century has continued to impact companies in other industries well into the twenty-first.In the same way, it will take a long time for the full impact of President Donald Trumpâ€™s tariffs on steel and aluminum to become clear. The Europeans are already threatening to impose tariffs on Levis and Harley-Davidsons.But businesses â€” and business leaders â€” cannot afford to wait until they do. They need to start thinking today about the ways in which this trade war could impact their companies tomorrow.As for the chicken tax, it remains in effect. It would have been repealed by the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, but â€¦ well, you know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross took a hard line on negotiations with China on Tuesday, saying that the Chinese have more to lose if there is a trade war with the United States and it risks higher prices for its domestic consumers if it slaps tariffs on US goods.Speaking in a television interview with CNBC, Ross also said the Trump Administration is expecting to reach a quick deal with the European Union on trade or it will impose tariffs on steel and aluminum fairly quickly. The Administration gave the EU an extra 30-day extension on Monday night.â€œI don't think we have any intention of protracted extensions,â€? Ross said. â€œThat defeats the whole purpose. EU is around 15% of all steel we bring in, so if we are going to impose it we'll have to do it pretty soon or else people will start gaming the system.â€?Both French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Trump last week to press him to drop the proposed 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum, but the EU said in a statement Tuesday that it was unhappy with just a temporary extension.â€œThe U.S. decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions,â€? the European Commission said. â€œThe EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security.'Ross is heading to China tonight along with Treasure Secretary Steven Mnuchin. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, and Peter Navarro, who is director of trade and industrial policy in the White House. While Mnuchin and Kudlow favor free trade, Ross, Lighthizer and Navarro have been outspoken in their criticism of Chinaâ€™s trade policies and called for the need to take measures to force Beijing to change its stand.Trump has invoked nationals security laws to threaten China with tariffs on steel and aluminum exports, as well as $150 billion worth of goods because of the alleged theft of intellectual property by China. The country requires US firms wanting to do business in China to form joint ventures with Chinese companies and turn over their intellectual property to their partners.In his interview, Ross said he believed the Administration had a stronger hand than the Chinese. â€œWe are the ones in the deficit position,â€? Ross said, referring to Chinaâ€™s $375 billion trade surplus with the US in 2017. â€œThat means they have more to lose at the end of the day than we do.â€?He gave the example of Chinese imports of US soybeans. If China puts tariffs on soybeans, it will raise prices to domestic consumers, he said. If China tries to buy more soybeans from Brazil, for example, he said the Brazilians would simply charge more and the US could sell to the markets that Brazilian farmers could no longer satisfy.Asked if it was possible to reach a deal separately with the Chinese on steel and aluminum but not intellectual property, Ross hinted that was unlikely.â€œIt's really all about behavior. Steel and aluminum deal with today's world, what is right now. Intellectual property rights deal with the future.

"As we approach the end of 2018, the situation for the domestic oil and gas industry is shifting in ways that could serve to dampen the ongoing boom as we move into 2019. Increased price volatility, tariffs and other trade-related considerations, along with pipeline bottlenecks and tight export infrastructure capacity could all serve to slow the growth of U.S. oil output in the coming year.Let's take a look at some of these looming limiters in more detail:Crude Oil Price Volatility - After almost three full quarters of a slow but steady rise in the price for crude, the last six weeks have been characterized by a higher degree of volatility and a significant downward trend, as the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) has dropped from an October 3 high of $76.31/bbl to around $66/bbl.Had this drop in prices taken place during September or November it would have had less impact around what to expect for 2019. As it is, this 15% fall in prices happened just as the companies drilling most of the wells in the U.S. - the large independent producers and the majors - are in the midst of setting their capital budgets for 2019. Obviously, when a company is setting its drilling budget in a $66/bbl price environment, it is likely to allocate less capital than it would in a $76/bbl environment.So, while the current price picture is plenty strong enough to result in continued overall production increases, we can expect this October price drop to have a dampening effect on the pace of growth during the first half of 2019.The Permian bottleneck is here. - The long-anticipated bottleneck in pipeline takeaway capacity from the Permian Basin is here, and there is very little relief in sight for the next 9-12 months as midstream companies struggle to catch up with the drilling boom. Producers can be very creative in finding other solutions during such periods of time, so we can expect overall Permian production of both oil and natural gas to continue to rise despite the bottleneck, though at a slower pace.Trade wars impact exports for both oil and LNG. - The Trump administration's growing trade war with China is starting to negatively impact exports of both crude oil and LNG as the two countries continue to trade escalating blows.On August 1, China halted imports of U.S. crude oil. While oil is a global, fungible commodity and the effects of that move will shake out in the longer term, it did cause short-term disruptions as U.S. suppliers scrambled to secure new markets for their product. As noted in previous columns, the Trump administration's tariffs on imported Chinese steel have also resulted in increased costs throughout the domestic oil and gas industry, which is heavily reliant on steel in all of its operations.Meanwhile, the trade war is also beginning to have a negative effect on the build-out in LNG export infrastructure in the U.S. On Tuesday, the proposed Magnolia LNG terminal located near Lake Charles, LA suffered a setback when a major Australian investor announced it would delay its final investment decision until 2019 in light of China's apparent decision to forego signing any new long-term LNG import deals with U.S. providers until the trade dispute is resolved.While it still seems likely that cooler heads on both sides will ultimately prevail and result in a new trade deal within the next year or so, it is becoming increasingly difficult for for major investors to base multi-billion dollar decisions on that expectation.Crude export facilities also running into roadblocks. - Meanwhile, the Gulf Coast's key port facility is running into headwinds in preparing its infrastructure for a new influx of production as the takeaway bottleneck in the Permian Basin resolves itself over the next two years.As noted earlier this year, the Port of Corpus Christi (PortCC), which has in some recent months been responsible for moving fully half of the nation's crude exports, is taking on debt in order to self-fund 2/3rds of the $330 million price tag for deepening and widening its main ship channel. This project is needed to allow the Port to fully load the largest class of oil tankers, or VLCCs.Unfortunately, despite two years of trying, PortCC officials have been unable to convince congress to fully fund its own share of the cost. Congress did include a rather paltry $13 million towards its obligation in September's so-called 'mini-bus' spending bill, but that still leaves right at $100 million still outstanding before the Army Corps of Engineers can move ahead with the project.As a near-term stop-gap, PortCC announced on Monday that it has entered into a long-term agreement with the Carlyle Group to develop a major crude oil export terminal on Harbor Island, located across the Intra-Coastal Canal from the resort town of Port Aransas. The Intra-Coastal is not currently deep and wide enough to allow the landing and full-loading of VLCCs, but under the agreement, Carlyle would be responsible for privately funding the cost of making it so. If completed, this terminal would become the first onshore U.S. port facility capable of fully-loading VLCCs for export.If everything goes according to plan, the Harbor Island terminal would be operational in late 2020. However, it is being opposed by a group of residents near Port Aransas, who have been very vocal in their opposition as this project has gone through its conceptual stage. So this will obviously become a key process to watch in the coming months.Bottom line: We can expect the domestic oil and gas boom to continue into 2019 as long as commodity prices remain at or higher than their current levels. But the factors listed here and others will serve to limit the scale of the boom until they are resolved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thereâ€™s been a spate of high-profile press headlines and news stories pointing to seeming evidence that the U.S. is winning the trade war with China. Two examples on the economic side suffice: â€œChina Loses Status as World's Second-Largest Stock Market Amid Trade War with U.S.,â€? which focused on the fall of the total value of Chinese equity shares being traded compared to those on Japanâ€™s stock market, and â€œThe Chinese Economy Starts to Feel Impact of U.S. Tariffs,â€? which, in part, pointed to slowing growth of Chinaâ€™s economy.In the political realm there was this: â€œAs Chinaâ€™s Woes Mount, Xi Jinping Faces Rare Rebuke at Home,â€? which reported on an unprecedented strikingly transparent paper published by the noted Chinese constitutional scholar, Xu Zhangrun of Tsinghua University, openly expressing his concerns about the â€œtotalitarianâ€? tendencies of Chinese leader Xi Jinping.As any decent economist will tell you, itâ€™s critical to distinguish between correlation and causation. Much of the current news stories on the impact on China of its trade war with the U.S. score a very low grade in this regard.China has registered tremendous rates of GDP growth for years, which do reflect genuine economic successes spurred on by truly innovative reformsâ€”although even these data are taken with large grains of salt by any serious observer of China in light of the questionable precision of the governmentâ€™s official statistics.But thereâ€™s a dirty little secret: deep-seated economic troubles have abounded within China for some time, indeed for decadesâ€”or at least they were evident as far back as the early 1990s, when I began working there.Those problems, about which I have written in this space a number of times, unmistakably stem from the contradiction inherent in the countryâ€™s self-titled â€œsocialist market economyâ€? reform program, for which the underlying principles were first articulated by the Chinese leadership in 1978 and formally adopted in 1992. How do you spell 'oxymoron?'China has been on a quest to have its cake and eat it too. The pressure engendered by these opposing forces has been building up over time. Given the sheer scale of China, which after all is the most populated country on the planet, it should be no surprise that the Chinese have had a long run of it. But time is beginning to run out. Something will have to give.Ultimately, however, an economy increasingly reliant on mammoth state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that have always hemorrhaged lossesâ€”only to be band-aided up by four equally large state-owned banks (SOBs) pretending to lend money to the SOEs while the SOEs make believe to pay back the loansâ€”will seize up. The rub is that the SOEs and SOBs are at the core of the Communist Partyâ€™s raison dâ€™etre.Throw on top of that a Potemkin private sector, which some well-respected China analysts a few years ago thought was on a sustainable growth path and potentially could overtake the SOEsâ€™ role in the Chinese economy. But they were confused by cyclical aberrations to a cemented secular trend of SOE dominance (a bit of irrational exuberance); ill-defined and unenforceable property rights, which have propagated strong incentives for corruption; and a tragic social policy that limited--at an arbitrary level--the number of children a couple could produce, which, after decades of enforcement, has created a tightening demographic noose on a young, vibrant workforce to provide for an aging population.Has the trade war ratcheted up anxiety within China? Of course. But there was a lot underway even before the trade war began in earnest, not only economically but also on the political side.Many Chinese I know will say privately they are deeply worried about Xi Jinpingâ€™s power-grab. Not only did he deliberately stock the highest levels of the Party leadership with comrades who have no substantial independent power-base or public charisma, and thus might qualify as an heir apparent, but he also strong-armed his colleagues to alter the constitution to essentially remove term limits for the top Party position, thus paving the wayâ€”at least for nowâ€”for Xi to retain his authority as long as he likes.The political fomentation these developments have produced among the population has little if anything to do with U.S. trade policy or Donald Trump. Without question, Professor Xuâ€™s public stand is very bold, but he is hardly alone in his views. How Xi responds to Xu will be critically important in assessing Chinaâ€™s political path going forward.In this vein, it would not be too Machiavellian for Xi, who desperately wants to maintain, indeed fortify, the lifeblood of the SOEs, to actually grab hold of the trade war with the U.S. as the narrative behind the economyâ€™s growth slowdown. The bully Donald Trump is just the scapegoat Xi and the Party need now. Indeed, Trumpâ€™s actions provide Xi with even greater cover to pump more money into the SOE-SOB shell game.Xiâ€™s pet projectâ€”the Belt Road Initiative (BRI)â€”can be seen as another version of the same ruse. BRI is the opportunity for China to seemingly support altruistically the economic development of its backyard (and way beyond) and at the same time export the huge excess capacity of the SOEs.Meanwhile, the naÃ¯ve Trump trade team is becoming a bit giddy about seemingly making inroads into the belly of the China trade beast. The team is wrong on three counts.First, and what should be the most obvious, is that this White House is underestimating the determination, the conviction and, most importantly, the temperamentâ€”at least for nowâ€”of the Chinese. The Chinese are nothing if they are not a patient bunch. To say that all of their initiatives throughout their history have been methodically designed for the long-haul would be a paramount understatement.I know this will come as a shock, but this is different from many other parts of the world, where short-termism and instant gratification are a way of life. Recognize the U.S. or its current President here?Second, and which is becoming clearer each day to the U.S. population, is that Trumpâ€™s war machine is exacting a far greater toll on the U.S. than on China.Itâ€™s well known that tariffs hurt U.S. consumers both because the imported goods they buy become more expensive, but also because in U.S. markets that aren't fully competitive, domestic firms producing similar products to what are otherwise imported get shielded and are allowed to charge U.S. consumers higher prices. Needless to say, that's the meaning of â€œprotectionâ€? behind an activist tariff policy.At the same time, tariffs inflict pain on firms located in the U.S. that use Chinese imports as inputs in their production process to make finalized products for sale. For them, the issue is how much of those increased input costs can they absorb before theyâ€™re forced to raise prices on the finished products to maintain profitability. The result can be lost sales otherwise made domestically.Or, if these U.S. firms export those final products to third countries, there will likely be a reduction in U.S. export revenues. Of course, that will increase the U.S. trade deficit. Thatâ€™s precisely the opposite of the ultimate goal with which the Trump team is singularly obsessed. Itâ€™s a fetish that no economist worth his or her own salt would have.But thereâ€™s an even more perverse effect: a significant amount of U.S. imports from China are produced by U.S. firms with operations within China. Those U.S. firms will be negatively impacted just the same as if they were actually Chinese firms shipping those imports to the U.S. Guess what will likely happen? Those China-located factories of U.S. firms will redirect their sales of exports from China away from the U.S. towards consumers in other marketsâ€”markets that are, by definition, not subject to the U.S. tariffs imposed on China.If the imposition of U.S. tariffs on such exports from China become long-lasting or highly elevated, it could well create an incentive for those firms to shift production from China to other markets in Asia, especially to countries in the ASEAN, where labor costs are far lower than in the U.S. If the Trump trade team believes its tariffs on China will result in U.S. firms shifting their production from China to the US, they are sadly mistaken.In contrast to Washingtonâ€™s shoot-oneself-in-the-foot strategy towards China, Beijingâ€™s tariffs on U.S. imports inflict far less pain on Chinese firms and consumers. Why? Itâ€™s simple: thereâ€™s an asymmetry of import patterns between the two countries. Whereas China is one of the top three sources of U.S. imports, which were valued at around US$550 billion in 2017, the most significant importers to China are Korea, Japan and the E.U. In 2017, Chinese imports from the U.S. were only about US$135 billion.As Trump gets wind of the complaints from U.S. consumers, workers and business owners that the costs theyâ€™re enduring at home from his China war campaign are becoming large, heâ€™s doubling down on his bet that the U.S. population is willing to put up with short term pain for long term gain. If the design and execution of his trade strategy were actually geared to deliver on that paradigm, he might have a chance.But it is not. Hereâ€™s why this is a fatal error: the Trump guys are fighting the wrong battle with China and using the wrong weapons.In a very real sense the White House is living mistakenly as if it is caught up in a battle strategy dilemma best coined by former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who quipped during the Iraq war that â€œyou go to war with the army you have, not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time.â€?It is just the opposite for Trump. He doesnâ€™t avail himself of the use of the appropriate arms to deal with Chinaâ€”weapons that are effective and fully available.The real battleground is not the pricing by China of its exports to the U.S.â€”in particular Washingtonâ€™s belief that the Chinese are setting their prices too low. If only price-setting was truly an economically meaningful, indeed even feasible, exercise for China to pull off! If it was, then the imposition of a tariffâ€”which after all is nothing but a tax added to a priceâ€”might be a potent weapon to bring about intended results. In fact, if anything, Trumpâ€™s war is actually helping to drive down the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar, which amounts to an across-the-board decrease in the price of all of Chinaâ€™s exports to the U.S.Rather, for the U.S.â€”as well as for the rest of the worldâ€”the strategic challenge with respect to China is that it is not a bona fide market economy and thus prices do not hold the import in conveying value as they do in most other economies. Chinaâ€™s prices are not freely set by supply and demand; yet it is equally fanciful to think that in such a complex economy, all prices are administered.In such a situation, Trumpâ€™s tariffs largely amount to a hindrance for Beijing. Think of them as white noise. The Chinese believe correctly that for them, Washingtonâ€™s tariffs are a side-show. Frankly thereâ€™s a bit of chuckling about it in Beijingâ€”at least for now. Even worse for the U.S., as noted earlier, the tariffs are just the type of medicine Xi actually would have loved to ask his doctor to prescribe for him to provide camouflage to further prop up the SOEs and SOBs.So, what we have really going on now is the proverbial picture of two men fighting, with the larger man outstretching his far longer arm pushing back at the forehead of his smaller opponent, who is swinging wildly his short arms trying to land a punch but is simply unable to reach and make contact.How could contact be made? It would if the U.S. stopped fiddling around with tariffs and with this two-man, that is, bilateral, fight and went for the jugular: The White House should enlist a multilateral coalition of the most powerful members of the WTO and formally find China in fundamental violation of its 2001 agreement acceding to the WTO and require it to renegotiate its terms of accession, as Iâ€™ve argued earlier in this space. Many WTO countries have been subjected to the same problems emanating from Beijing as the U.S. in varying degrees. The case for the â€œlogic of collective actionâ€? couldnâ€™t be more compelling.It is regrettable, that despite implementing some ingenious policiesâ€”in fact, utilizing a genuinely innovative process of reform experimentation from which the U.S. and many other countries can greatly learnâ€”China simply has not fully lived up to its numerous legal commitments agreed to in writing 17 years ago to enact and execute the detailed reforms that would transform its system into a market economy.Beijing already bristles at the fact that it is still being treated by the WTO as a â€œNon-Market-Economyâ€?, which, in essence means China is subject to different methodologies in calculating penalties, among other matters. But in so many dimensionsâ€”from Chinaâ€™s requirements for technology transfer, to the misapplication of its body of economic-related laws, to the administrative intrusion in business decision-making in order to stifle competition, among other areasâ€”weâ€™ve gone way beyond the point where Chinaâ€™s WTO classification is a mechanism that has any utility in getting to the heart of the matter.Renegotiation of Chinaâ€™s WTO accession across-the-board is the only avenue worth pursuing, and the most appropriate one to test Chinaâ€™s resolve to abide by trading rules it will agree to on a global basis. Dare I say it is the â€œadult approachâ€? compared to the current circumstances. It places the incentives exactly where they should be: it would then be fully up to China to decide if it wants or does not want to be a WTO member and if it does want to be a member, then on what terms. Most importantly, it will leave Xi with little wiggle room to show his cards as to what kind of economy he believes the Chinese people want.There should be no doubt this will be a messy process both inside China and outside of it. But to be frank, we all have little choice at this juncture, especially if the WTO is to have any credibility going forward. Continuing with the status quo could well mean the WTO's days are numbered.Why does this approach offer a chance to bring about real results for China? Because what deeply worries the Chinese leadership most is maintaining social stability at home and not having the domestic population lose confidence in the direction and performance of the Chinese economy.Should Xi decide to substantially downgrade Chinaâ€™s WTO commitments or fully withdraw from the WTO, there is a high likelihood that will set off a significant crisis of confidence at homeâ€”not to mention abroad, which, in turn will fuel the fire in China. Within China, at the very least such a crisis would be the tipping point for the SOE-SOB house of cards as citizens pull their money out of Chinese banks and try to buy dollars and other foreign currency. It would also decimate Chinaâ€™s stock market. As large as Beijingâ€™s foreign currency reserves areâ€”more than $3 trillion, the largest in the worldâ€”it is equivalent to roughly 25% of Chinaâ€™s GDP. While that might help stabilize an economy as large and as complex as Chinaâ€™s for a short period of time, those resources will not save the day.Xi and his economic advisors know this story well. But theyâ€™re counting on this White House to continue its flailing tit-for-tat tariff war. If Trump was serious about understanding where are Chinaâ€™s real pressure points, heâ€™d take a crack at trying to understand this story as well. Itâ€™s the only chance he has to actually being declared the winner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"â€œThe law of unintended consequences, often cited but rarely defined, is that actions of peopleâ€”and especially of governmentâ€”always have effects that are unanticipated or unintended. Economists and other social scientists have heeded its power for centuries; for just as long, politicians and popular opinion have largely ignored it.â€?-- The Library of Economics and LibertyPresident Trump thought his tariffs on Chinese imports would compel American companies that use Chinese labor to bail out of China and move those jobs to the United States.He was half right.American manufacturers are leaving or considering leaving China, but theyâ€™re not moving their operations to the United States, according to a report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in South China.â€œIt is interesting to note that just one percent of the study participants indicate any plans for establishing manufacturing in North America,â€? the report said. Rather, they are eyeing Southeast Asian countries, such as Vietnam and Cambodia.â€œMore than 70 percent of the U.S. companies are considering delaying or canceling investment in China and relocating of some or all manufacturing out of China,â€? the report said. â€œSoutheast Asian countries are the priority when planning relocaÂ­tion of manufacturing lines outside of China.â€?Another unintended consequence of the tariffs is that American companies in China say they are running up against more non-tariff barriers than before the trade war started. About half the companies surveyed for the report, not all of which were American, said the Chinese government had been subjecting them to more regulatory scrutiny, more bureaucratic oversight and slower customs clearance.With the worldâ€™s second largest economy, China is an enormous market for foreign companies. Many are there not just for cheap labor, but to sell their products and services to Chinese consumers. Those that are considering moving their operations elsewhere in Southeast Asia say they would continue selling into the Chinese market.In addition to thinking that his war on China will pressure American companies to move jobs from China to the U.S., Trump is incensed by Chinaâ€™s huge trade surplus with the United States â€“ $375.6 billion at the end of 2017 â€“ and by Chinaâ€™s myriad unfair trade practices.Trade experts agree that both issues are problematic, but slamming China with tariffs is not the solution. It has only made things worse for American businesses whether they are based in China or in the United States. It has been particularly hard on American farmers, for whom China is a large and important market.Now we learn that Trump is considering yet more tariffs against China. These would cover every Chinese import not already subject to the tariffs he has imposed this year, which affect more than $250 billion of goods -- not including the steel and aluminum tariffs he imposed on China and other countries. Trump plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina at the end of November. Presumably, if Xi doesnâ€™t get on his knees and beg Trump for mercy, then itâ€™s bombs away.Thereâ€™s a saying: crooked rivers get that way by following the path of least resistance. One could change it around by saying profitable companies get that way by following the path of lowest labor costs. Those will not be found in the United States, no matter what Trump does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Trump administration this month described a range of actions it planned to take against China, from investment restrictions to tariffs to a case at the World Trade Organization (WTO). China, in turn, warned the United States of the serious consequences of a trade war.So how did we get to this juncture? We have not had an uncontrolled escalation of trade barriers since the Great Depression. That episode was sufficiently bad that the major trading nations of the world devoted a great deal of post-war effort to avoiding a repeat.It is tempting to place all the blame on the Trump administration, with its aggressive and unorthodox approach to international relations. In fact, each side deserves a share.As far as China is concerned, it has failed to grow into its role as a global economic power. It took on substantial obligations to liberalize its economy when it joined the WTO in 2001. In the lead-up to that moment, there had been a major debate about whether China should join as a developing nation with relatively few obligations (because China was poor) or whether it should take on the burdens that developed nations assume (because China was large). As it played out, Chinaâ€™s commitments were more befitting a developed country. That did not mean that China committed to avoiding all objectionable behavior. But its commitments were significant, and it largely followed them.However, China was left feeling that it had done at least its fair share. It was not inclined to do much to help conclude the next round of global trade talks (the â€œDohaâ€? round), which faltered badly in 2008. Then, with the global financial crisis, China lost much of its motivation to follow the lead of the West in adopting economic reforms.In its turn away from reform, China ended up taking a lot of actions the United States and others found objectionable. It pursued policies such as a cavalier approach to intellectual property, extensive subsidies and an excessive state role in markets. These were a very poor fit with a basically cooperative and market-oriented global economic system and contributed significantly to tensions with the United States and other countries. Chinaâ€™s mistreatment of foreign companies investing there has meant that a major voice for moderation in commercial relations â€“ the U.S. business community â€“ has stepped back significantly from that role.The United States, meanwhile, has often let itself get distracted in its commercial diplomacy with China. The Trump administration certainly does this with its badly misguided emphasis on bilateral trade deficits. But earlier Congresses and White Houses gave undue emphasis to Chinaâ€™s currency policies at a time when the United States really had no better alternative policies to push for.Not only did the U.S. wish list have the wrong items at the top, it was often excessively long. Bilateral dialogues would conclude with promises across a wide and unfocused range of topics, rather than concentrating on a few key points of concern.The Trump administration, in its erratic and unfocused behavior toward China, has made a bad situation worse. It canceled those dialogues altogether. Meanwhile, the president veers between warm summitry, quick trade deals and claims that no one can blame the Chinese on the one hand, and railing about trade deficits, intellectual property violations and trade barriers on the other. There is neither an obvious sequencing to the complaints nor any clear signaling to the Chinese about prioritization. This lack of clarity is a major risk factor for conflict.Beyond this, the Trump administration pursues diplomatic approaches that are almost guaranteed to fail. The most effective method of changing Chinese economic behavior is through multilateral initiatives, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the WTO. The Trump administration abandoned the TPP almost immediately and has derided and neglected the WTO. It has expressed a general disdain for multilateral approaches, for no particularly good reason. A next-best approach would be an alliance with some key trading partners such as the European Union, Canada and Japan, but Trump actions such as the Section 232 steel tariffs have systematically alienated those potential allies.As to what comes next, China seems to have been fairly careful about not responding to policy announcements but instead waiting until policies are actually adopted. Whether the resulting calm precedes a storm will depend on whether the Trump administration can find its diplomatic footing with a seriously reshuffled cast of characters. Given that the presidentâ€™s top trade advisers were selected for their aggressive and benighted approach on the topic, there is relatively little reason for optimism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The focus shifts from China to Europe as Trump arrives for the NATO Summit.Markets have swallowed the Chinese news, but car tariffs may be different.Here is everything you need to know in our second weekly tranche of Trade War from the Trenches.Last week â€“ ChinaLast week, the US imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, as they had telegraphed well in advance. And as expected as well, China responded by its pledge to retaliate in a tit-for-tat manner. Markets received it quite well in a â€œbuy the rumor, sell the factâ€? pattern. China was the focus on our initial Trade War from the Trenches weekly update.The US response to Chinaâ€™s counter-tariffs is awaited. Also, the new Mexican government is taking shape, and at the moment, the new President decided to maintain the current NAFTA negotiation team. The focus now shifts to Europe.This week â€“ EuropeUS President Donald Trump travels to Europe for the NATO Summit that is held on July 11th and 12th. He will also visit the UK and meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on July 16th in Helsinki. We begin with Trumpâ€™s approach to NATO and continue with other developments in the trade war in Europe.1) Trump ties military spending and tradeThe US President has a transactional view of world affairs, preferring bilateral deals where everything is on the table, and everything is related. In recent weeks, Trump has been criticizing European countries which have not met their spending obligations to NATO: 2% of GDP.And as the Summit nears, Trump tied NATO spending and trade grievances in one tweet. Trump implies that if countries do not pay up, he may punish them on trade.So, trade policy significantly depends on the outcome of the NATO Summit. If Trump is appeased by some efforts by European countries to cough up more money for security, he could soften up on trade. Such a development would be positive for markets, will create higher certainty for business and will trigger a risk-on mood that helps commodity currencies and also the Euro and Pound against the safe-haven Japanese Yen and the US Dollar.If the Summit sees another G-7 style clash between the President and his peers, the safe-haven Japanese Yen and US Dollar may gain against all the rest, while markets may suffer. Angry, separate, statements by the US and its allies, as well as angry tweets by Trump could serve as a proof of a failed event.2) Car tariffs after Merkelâ€™s moveThe US imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, and retaliatory tariffs followed these by the EU on politically-targeted items, such as Harley Davidson motorbikes. The moves eroded confidence and hurt specific industries but are the small change in the grander scheme of economic ties across the pond.The greater grievance is about the EUâ€™s tariffs on cars, which, according to Trump, is unfair to the US. The President threatened to slap duties on tariffs on autos and auto parts on European vehicles.A surprising move came from German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week. She opened the door to reducing these duties on cars to â€œall countries,â€? but it is clear that her aim is at the US. German carmakers do not want any issues with the vast American market.These words had a minor effect on markets, especially as the US did not respond. As Merkel and Trump meet around the NATO Summit, the topic of cars will undoubtedly be raised. If the American President makes more positive noises on vehicles, it could be positive for markets. If Merkelâ€™s open door is slammed by the US with a repeat of the intentions to slap tariffs, it could have the opposite effect.There is some speculation that the EU may respond to a major move on cars with a major step on tech. The â€œtech-lashâ€? that is seen in Europe may turn into tariffs on Google, Facebook, and others. However, we are still far from that.3) Chinese â€“ European cooperationPrime Minister Li Keqiang visited Berlin on July 9th and met with Merkel. Both sides stressed the need for free trade, something that was a common value for the US and the EU not that long ago. China made its own pledges to open up, similar in tone to Merkelâ€™s move. The timely serves as a warning to the US that it cannot fight trade wars on different fronts at the same time.Negotiations between China and the EU, economies of roughly the same scale, continue. Any Chinese comments supporting the EU or any intentions to cut trade barriers between the two will not be unnoticed by the US.In such a case, will Trump back down or double-down? In the past, he has shown a willingness to double-down and strike harder. So, any EU-Sino development could have an impact on relations between the EU and the UK as well.More: Trade wars: Only a stock market crash can stop Trump, 3 reasons",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is no letting down in trade wars after the catastrophic G-7 Summit and the China tariffs.Markets are beginning to pay a bit more attention, but not panicking just yet.There are three critical dates for each geographic region to pencil in.US President Donald Trump is picking fights on trade, and not only on trade, as he said that the German government is not acting according to the will of the people on immigration. As mentioned in the past, there are three open fronts: the North American one, the European one, and the Chinese one.Uncertainty about the future already takes its toll as some orders and investment are postponed. At the moment, the impact is still limited, and the global economy is doing great. The time left until these dates allow for negotiation and reaching some agreements that would defuse the situation. After these dates, it would be much harder to undo the damage.Markets reacted so far in a recurring pattern: selling off on the dips but bouncing back quite quickly. The â€œbuy the dipâ€? mentality is hard to get rid of. What do markets know? They may think that Trump is making bombastic claims and moves, going to the edge only to come back.The hardline decisions are egged on by the Trump-supportive media and come ahead of the US Mid-Term elections in November which may see Democrats retake the House. Trump may be trying to fulfill campaign promises and shore up his base, driving them to vote. Nevertheless, some adverse developments cannot be easily undone even if they are only there as political stunts.Here are updates on these three fronts and the relevant dates to watch on each one.1) Europe â€“ watch the long weekend beginning on June 28thEuropean leaders meet for a Summit on June 28th and June 29th. Brexit was supposed to be the primary topic, but the EU may do what it always does: kick the can down the road to the October Summit.Yet with trade, they are set to move forward with retaliation against US tariffs on steel and aluminum that will come into effect on July 1st. So far, Europe has shown a united front against Trumpâ€™s protectionism and vowed to maintain the post-war multilateral order. They are likely to announce the exact details of the counter tariffs.Yet not everything in the old continent is hunky dory. Countries are set against each other on the rule of law (the VisegrÃ¡d Group), immigration (Italy vs. Spain, Germany vs. Germany), and Russia, with the new Italian government willing to improve relations with the big neighbor to the east.If Italy or any other country steps out of line and opposes imposing counter-duties on the US, it could provide relief. Such an ease may be temporary but opens the door to improvement.If not, the EU will move forward with tariffs and the US is set to make its own retaliation. The Administration is already looking into slapping tariffs on European cars and car parts. As mentioned earlier, these moves can be undone, but it is easier to refrain from imposing duties than to remove them.2) North America â€“ July 1stIn the failed G-7 Summit, Trump clashed with Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister. The latter said he would not be pushed around and the US President angrily pulled off from signing the communique. the North American Free Trade Agreement talks were close to a conclusion, but the US insisted on a sunset clause: renegotiating the deal.Earlier, the US imposed a 25% on steel and a 10% aluminum on Canada and Mexico, invoking Article 232 which refers to national security. The use of the security excuse offended Canada and dealt a blow to the negotiations. The suggestion that the US could strike bilateral deals with each of its neighbors was rejected by both sides.While negotiations are going nowhere fast, the US tariffs and steel and aluminum and Mexicoâ€™s counter-tariffs already cause uncertainty and postpone orders. US fruit exports to Mexico and Canadian metals are in limbo.However, Mexicans go to the polls on July 1st to elect a new President. The outgoing business-friendly administration of Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto continues talking with the US at this late stage of the campaign and may want to reach some kind of an agreement. Opinion polls suggest that Mexicoâ€™s new leader will be AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, or AMLO, a hard-left populist. AMLO said he would respect any deal, but if no agreement is achieved, he will go his own way.Therefore, the outgoing Mexican Administration has a short period to reach an agreement that would somewhat ease tensions and corner Canada. Yet if they stick to the trilateral NAFTA arrangement, and AMLO is elected President, the chances of successful deal continue falling.July 1st is also Canadaâ€™s Independence Day. Standing up for Canadians, as Trudeau stressed, may have a greater emphasis on this day.3) China â€“ July 6thThe most recent development is the American decision to tackle Chinese tech with tariffs worth $50 billion. Chinaâ€™s response was swift and it announced countermeasures. Yet also here, the decision has not come into force just yet.The worldâ€™s No. 1 and No. 2 economies have been in talks for quite some time. Back in May, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the press that trade wars had been put on hold. His soothing words were shattered by Trump which back-pedaled and took a harder stance. Nevertheless, Chinaâ€™s offer to buy more American goods could resurface and kickstart fresh negotiations.If not, the US tariffs will come into effect on July 6th, and Chinaâ€™s counter move is due on the same day. A significant blow to trade between the two superpowers could cause a broader adverse effect on markets.ConclusionThe global economy is still humming along quite nicely, but fears of a full-blown trade war are already causing some damage. We see some trade skirmishes or border clashes but no full-blown trade war quite yet. After the three dates mentioned here come and go with new tariffs, stocks could crash, and the safe-haven yen could soar while commodity currencies may plunge.Will it happen? We will know soon enough.More:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The China-US trade war has escalated with the US planning to levy tariff on USD 200bn of Chinese goods and China vows retaliation, according to Amy Yuan Zhuang, Research Analyst at Nordea Markets.Key Quotesâ€œOn Tuesday evening local time the US Commerce Department released a list of Chinese goods worth USD 200bn that will be subject to 10% tariff. It could take effect after public consultations end on 30 August.â€?â€œFactoring in the USD 34bn of Chinese goods already subject to 25% tariff and the USD 16bn expected in late July that would bring the Chinese goods affected to USD 250bn, about 50% of US imports from China.â€?â€œChina vowed to retaliate this â€œtotally unacceptableâ€? move but offered no details. We still think that non-tariff measures such as business and investment regulation are more likely than Treasury dumping and currency devaluation.â€?â€œThe CNY and CNH weakened about 0.5% against the USD on the news.â€?â€œThe new round of tariffs, targeting USD 200bn of Chinese goods, will no doubt inflict much more pain on Chinese growth than the initial USD 34bn. However, it does not leave the US economy unaffected.â€?â€œThe USD 200bn of Chinese goods affected by the new round of tariffs includes mostly basic consumer goods such as apparel, furniture and electronics. Given that these goods account for a sizable share of US imports from China and the relative large weight in the US consumer price basket, the new round of tariffs could have a significant impact on consumer prices and thereby possibly influence the FOMC rate decisions.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Direct damages to China and the US due to the trade war will be similar, analysts estimate. For the American and Chinese economies, consequences would result in the loss of 0.2 to 0.3% of annual GDP, and although this is not so serious, the US economy could collapse as early as the first half of 2019, believes a Russian expert.Analysts have estimated economic consequences in light of recent US and Chinese actions: in response to Trumpâ€™s statements about imposing 25% tariffs on Chinese imports, China has announced symmetrical measures in relation to US goods.â€œThe situation is extremely tense, markets are in a nervous state, even though the scenario of the US-China trade war has been calculated,â€? said financial analyst Nikita Maslennikov.According to him, there are chances that Trumpâ€™s administration, inspired by short-term economic successes, will close its eyes to risks and long-term consequences, said Maslennikov.â€œBy 2019, the trade war will be capable of provoking a recession in the US. As a result, what we do not least wish to happen is the repeat of the crisis of 2008 and 2009,â€? he said, adding that China understands very well the risks they will have to deal with.Direct losses to the US and Chinese economies would be similar. However, the volumes of risks to China can pose a serious problem. The US has a more developed financial system, its economy is more geared to global financial markets than the Chinese. As such, China has the potential to seek appropriate commitments and decisions, according to Maslennikov.â€œOn the other hand, one can understand the Chinese positioning. How much time can be played in this game of poker â€“ everything that is agreed to by the US is reevaluated in two or three weeks. One may or may not trust what was agreed with the Trump administration,â€? he continued.- Advertisement -The side effects of this war will be largely negative for the economies of the economic partners of China and the US, which in fact cover the entire Pacific region. So a new recession could start earlier than expected.According to an analyst and professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Ekaterina Arapova, in a long-term perspective, this trade war can cause changes in Chinaâ€™s economic system, that is, the transformation of domestic consumption as the main incentive of the economy, thus developing innovative industries.â€œIn a way, this trade war will contribute to the acceleration of all these processes in the Chinese economy as an additional stimulator. At the moment, China can not introduce import quotas for US state-of-the-art technology products because it relies on technologies from American and other developed countries,â€? she said.Arapova added that measures restricting imports of raw materials could also encourage the development of alternative energy to the Asian giant.It is noteworthy that the Chinese response measures target the production of the US states that voted the most for Trump during the presidential elections. Tariff affected products include soybeans, corn, wheat, rice, sorghum, beef, pork, poultry, fish, dairy, nuts and vegetables.According to data from Bloomberg Intelligence , the total value of US coal exported to China last year was US $395 million. Today, China is one of the major buyers of US oil. This purchase helps stimulate the growth of US exports.Meanwhile, for China, as the country is the worldâ€™s largest oil importer, US oil is only a small part of its energy balance. The largest suppliers are Saudi Arabia and Russia. In this regard, analysts believe that Chinese countermeasures can painfully affect US commodity exporters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The increasing threat of a trade war between the U.S. and China seems to loom closer each day, though President Trump seems confident America will win its trade dispute with the worldâ€™s second-largest economy.Continue Reading Belowâ€œPresident Xi and I will always be friends, no matter what happens with our dispute on trade. China will take down its Trade Barriers because it is the right thing to do. Taxes will become Reciprocal & a deal will be made on Intellectual Property. Great future for both countries!â€? Trump said in a tweet on Sunday.China and the U.S. have been inching toward a trade war by announcing proposed tariffs in a tit-for-tat fashion. Trump last Thursday said he would ask U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider an additional $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S., the latest move in the dispute with China.Earlier that week, the Trump administration published a list of imported Chinese products that could face additional tariffs, which it said were part of Americaâ€™s response to the countryâ€™s â€œunfair trade practices related to the forced transfer of U.S. technology and intellectual property.â€? In a swift response, China announced it would implement tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods, including soybeans, autos and aircraft.Despite this, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday he doesnâ€™t expect the U.S. to enter a trade war with the Asian country, which is the largest purchaser of American soybeans and a critical market for Chicago-based airplane maker Boeing.'Our expectation is that we don't think there will be a trade war; our objective is to continue to have discussions with China ... I don't expect there will be a trade war â€“ it could be, but I don't expect it at all,' he told CBS' â€œFace The Nation.â€?AdvertisementStill, some experts say the issue has turned more political than just pure economics.â€œXi Jinping, the Chinese ruler, has accumulated absolutely power â€“ or close to absolute power. That means he becomes responsible for everything,â€? Gordon Chang, author of â€œThe Coming Collapse of China,â€? told Maria Bartiromo on Sunday. â€œIf you have a problem in a trade with the United States, he knows that heâ€™s got to intimidate us, so heâ€™s going to use all of his power and authority to go after us, so this could get ugly.â€?Trump pledged in early March to take action against China for its alleged theft of intellectual property from tech firms in Silicon Valley. Though China is able to access the U.S. tech sector, the country is cutting off their own, Chang said, noting the issue was likely more important than trade itself.â€œThis is where the competition for China and the United States is going to be played out,â€? he said. â€œYeah, trade is important, but itâ€™s going to be who owns 5G, quantum computing, quantum communications and artificial intelligence.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He called on China and the US to work together to solve the issue.â€œThe solution for that and the shaper of the trade, is technology,â€? he added.He noted that the big advantage Asia had over others was its confidence in technology and the internet.Comparing Asiaâ€™s acceptance of technology with Europe, he said: â€œIn Europe, people worry about technology such as the internet. They think more about how to control or make regulations.â€?In Asia, however, he said, the discussion was more about how to make the internet and technology more inclusive.â€œNot only entrepreneurs, but the governments, take very special interest in technology.â€?Ma specifically commended Malaysia for having a special group of government officers discussing e-commerce.Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng has been reported as saying that the US-China trade war may benefit Malaysia in the short-term.Lim said Malaysiaâ€™s diplomatic position with both countries would provide the country with unique opportunities.Recently, the South China Morning Post reported Chinaâ€™s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan as saying China would not cave in to US demands even if it faced further tariffs on its exports.The US-China trade war reportedly began when US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on US$34 billion or over RM141 billion worth of Chinese goods.China hit back by imposing duties on US$50 billion of US products.

"Sandy Baruah, president and CEO of the Detroit Regional Chamber (Photo: Detroit Regional Chamber)With good economic times at hand, isnâ€™t now a good time to get tough on trade and employ some old-fashioned tariffs? In a word, no.When we were building our nation, tariffs served as the governmentâ€™s key form of revenue. As a new nation, we needed to import, well, just about everything. When we were a rapidly growing nation, and without local supply, tariffs worked out fairly well. Since those early days, however, tariff wars have not worked out well for the United States.Republicans tried this with the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff. The results were disastrous, accelerating the nation into the Great Depression. It has been Republican orthodoxy ever since that tariffs were bad. Donald Trump, as he has done with many things, has turned this orthodoxy on its head.For many, the idea of tariffs is appealing. It fosters images of getting tough on foreign companies and supporting red, white and blue companies. Letâ€™s examine some myths.Myth 1: American families are harmed by imported goods. A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics shows that, on average, American households have increased purchasing power of $18,000 annually thanks to our access to imported goods. Roughly translated, household incomes in America would be $18,000 less per year if we did not participate in the global economy.Myth 2: Trade deficits cost America money. Some claim other nations are â€œripping us offâ€? because we import more goods than we export. This is like complaining that my family has a trade deficit with the local Kroger. I purchase a lot from Kroger, and it buys nothing from me. This is a trade deficit, but certainly does not mean that Iâ€™m getting ripped off (especially when I use coupons).Myth 3: Imported goods cost U.S. jobs. This is flawed thinking on many fronts. Just one example of an imported good, a Jaguar sedan, employs scores of Americans. From the U.S.-based company operations staff, the shipping and dock workers, to the sales people in communities across the nation. And this one British product contains more Southfield-based Lear Corporation components than most other vehicles in the industry. A study by the Trade Partnership Worldwide concludes 41 million American jobs â€“ more than 1 million in Michigan â€“ depend on trade.Myth 4: A tariff war will Increase U.S. manufacturing. Even U.S.-built goods, depend on parts from around the world. U.S.-built cars generally have around 20% component parts from other nations. The proposed tariffs on auto parts, along with the already implemented steel and aluminum tariffs could increase the price of a U.S.-built car by nearly $2,000. The cost of an imported car could increase in cost by as much as $9,000. Price hikes like these will certainly dampen auto sales, impacting the employees of manufacturers, suppliers, dealers and more.Of all the states in the nation, Michigan is one of the most trade dependent. Our technology, manufacturing and agriculture industries are global powerhouses. Our success in international markets is a key element of Michiganâ€™s â€“ and Detroitâ€™s â€“ turnaround.Sandy K. Baruah is the President and CEO of the Detroit Regional Chamber and served as U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce under President George W.

"President Trumpâ€™s political adversaries and globalists, including the media pundits, are frantically yelping about how the Presidentâ€™s proposed tariffs against Chinese imports would spark a â€œTrade war.â€?In point of fact, concerns about a trade war with China are late -- very late -- and have nothing to do with Trumpâ€™s proposed tariffs.In reality China has, for decades, engaged in a one-sided â€œtrade warâ€? with the United States that doesnâ€™t involve tariffs but wide-spread and wide-scale theft of intellectual property.One-sided relationships are not relationships!Foolishly, a succession of previous administrations have facilitated this outrageous situation.My previous FrontPage Magazine article, Educating America's Adversaries focused on the lunacy of the United States hundreds of thousands of Chinese students to study STEM (Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) disciplines and also providing them with optional practical training at U.S. corporations unwittingly providing them with the opportunity to engage in industrial espionage.My article today is predicated on an April 4, 2018 Justice Department press release, Chinese Scientist Sentenced to Prison in Theft of Engineered Rice, that reported on the sentencing of a Chinese scientist, Weiqiang Zhang, for his crimes that, although not related to military concerns, are related to intellectual property theft (trade secrets), specifically genetically engineered rice seeds with potentially profound implications.That press release begins with the following sentence:A Chinese scientist was sentenced to 121 months in a federal prison for conspiring to steal samples of a variety of rice seeds from a Kansas biopharmaceutical research facility.This excerpt from the press release provides the salient background information:Weiqiang Zhang, 51, a Chinese national, and U.S. legal permanent resident residing in Manhattan, Kansas, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Carlos Murguia in the District of Kansas. Zhang was convicted on Feb. 15, 2017 of one count of conspiracy to steal trade secrets, one count of conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property and one count of interstate transportation of stolen property.Evidence at trial established that Zhang worked as a rice breeder for Ventria Bioscience in Junction City, Kansas. Ventria develops genetically programmed rice to express recombinant human proteins, which are then extracted for use in the therapeutic and medical fields. Zhang has a masterâ€™s degree in agriculture from Shengyang Agricultural University in China and a doctorate from Louisiana State University.According to trial evidence, Zhang acquired without authorization hundreds of rice seeds produced by Ventria and stored them at his residence in Manhattan. The rice seeds have a wide variety of health research applications and were developed to produce either human serum albumin, contained in blood, or lactoferrin, an iron-binding protein found, for example, in human milk. Ventria spent millions of dollars and years of research developing its seeds and cost-effective methods to extract the proteins, which are used to develop lifesaving products for global markets. Ventria used locked doors with magnetic card readers to restrict access to the temperature-controlled environment where the seeds were stored and processed.Zhang conspired with other citizens of China as noted in this paragraph:Trial evidence demonstrated that in the summer of 2013, personnel from a crop research institute in China visited Zhang at his home in Manhattan. Zhang drove the visitors to tour facilities in Iowa, Missouri and Ohio. On Aug. 7, 2013, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers found seeds belonging to Ventria in the luggage of Zhangâ€™s visitors as they prepared to leave the United States for China.This case is infuriating on a number of levels.First of all, Zhang was provided lawful immigrant status, placing him, should he have so desired, on the pathway to United States citizenship.He also obtained a first-rate education in the United States, having received his Phd from Louisiana State University.America had opened its heart and doors to Zhang and an opportunity to live the â€œAmerican Dream.â€?Rather than express gratitude for Americaâ€™s generosity, he betrayed America and the American company for which he worked.Zhang and his Chinese cohorts saw in Americaâ€™s kindness and generosity, weaknesses that could be easily exploited.This specific case calls to mind the statements of Mitt Romney who, during his campaign for the presidency, repeatedly said that when the United States provides foreign students with an education, we should â€œstaple Green Cards on their diplomas so that they donâ€™t go half-way across the world when they graduate.â€?Of course Mitt is hardly the only politician to urge the admission of huge numbers of foreign students and call for them to be granted lawful immigrant status upon their graduation from American universities.The best way of addressing concerns that foreign students will leave the United States upon graduation is to make certain that American students should fill those classrooms, lecture halls and laboratories. When American students graduate they are likely to go no further than half-way across town, or perhaps, half-way across the United States, but not half-way across the earth.While it was not disclosed whether Zhang was granted lawful immigrant status before or after he secured his doctoral degree from Louisiana State University, we do know he conspired to send stolen intellectual property, that the genetically modified rice seeds represented, from his U.S. employer half-way around the world his native China, our Most Favored Nation trade â€œpartner.â€?Those rice seeds and the methodology used to create them, that Zhang stole, required years of hard work and an investment of millions of dollars. They can be used for wide-ranging health science applications and will likely generate huge profits in the global marketplace.This case is, unfortunately, not an isolated case.Understandably President Trump has decided that â€œenough is enoughâ€? and has proposed to impose tariffs on Chinese imports. However, the globalists such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have expressed their displeasure at the Presidentâ€™s actions, concerned about a possible â€œtrade warâ€? blithely ignoring that for decades, Chinaâ€™s trade policies and currency manipulation and increasing belligerent conduct is harmful and dangerous to America and Americans.These globalists and prior administrations also know that China has engaged in massive industrial espionage in the United States and their computer programmers hack corporate and government computers thousands of times.The ever-increasing scope, magnitude and sophistication of Chinese computer hacking and cyber-espionage are worrying, to say the least.On October 5, 2017 Newsweek published an article, Cyberwar: How Chinese Hackers Became A Major Threat To The U.S. that paints a clear and extremely troubling picture about Chinaâ€™s increasing hacking activities that threaten U.S. national security.Again, the question that must be asked is how many members of the Chinese â€œHacking armyâ€? were educated in the United States?Here is a brief excerpt from the Newsweek article:In its 2015 Global Threat Report, the American cyberintelligence firm CrowdStrike identified dozens of Chinese adversaries targeting business sectors that are key to the Five-Year Plan. It found 28 groups going after defense and law enforcement systems alone. Other sectors victimized worldwide included energy, transportation, government, technology, health care, finance, telecommunications, media, manufacturing and agriculture.Chinaâ€™s theft of military and trade secrets has been so rampant that editorial cartoonists Jeff Parker and Dave Granlund depicted it as â€œChinese takeout.â€?On November 27, 2017 the DOJ issued a press release, U.S. Charges Three Chinese Hackers Who Work at Internet Security Firm for Hacking Three Corporations for Commercial Advantage, that began with this statement:An indictment was unsealed today against Wu Yingzhuo, Dong Hao and Xia Lei, all of whom are Chinese nationals and residents of China, for computer hacking, theft of trade secrets, conspiracy and identity theft directed at U.S. and foreign employees and computers of three corporate victims in the financial, engineering and technology industries between 2011 and May 2017. The three Chinese hackers work for the purported China-based Internet security firm Guangzhou Bo Yu Information Technology Company Limited (a/k/a â€œBoyusecâ€?).While those alleged computer hackers allegedly committed their crimes from China and without entering the United States, questions that were not addressed in the press release include whether any of the indicted alleged hackers were educated in the United States or if any other Chinese citizens may have worked for any of the companies that were targeted for the cyber attack to enable them to more easily gain access to the computer networks that were attacked.My dad taught me that there are no mistakes in life, only lessons- provided that we learn from those instances when things go wrong.He also taught me that we teach those with whom we interact as to how they should treat us be demonstrating what we will and wonâ€™t accept.For far too long the United States has refused to stand up to nations such as China, that certainly do not have Americaâ€™s best interests at heart.In point of fact, Chinese intransigence has been unaffected by a succession of administrations that provided China with carrots such as conferring upon China Most Favored Nation status but few, if any â€œsticks.â€?Trumpâ€™s policies are consistent with my dadâ€™s sage advice and are a welcome change from the spineless approach of past administrations.President Trump needs to take a hard look at the issuance of student visas to citizens of China, particularly where STEM courses of study are concerned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The US President Trump provides massive subsidies as China, Mexico, and the EU retaliate tariffs move.The USDA will authorize up to $12 billion in programs, which is in line with the estimated $11 billion impact of the unjustified retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods.The US President Donald Trump is getting ready to fight a full-scale trade war ordering Agriculture Secretary to prepare supporting measures for the US farmers to help to smooth the negative effects on US farm products as a result of retaliatory action against the US from its trading partners including China, Mexico, and the European Union.This all came one day before the US President Trump is scheduled to meet Jean Claude Juncker for discussion about the trade tariffs. It is widely expected that the main subject to their discussion is going to be tariffs on cars.The US Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue prepared a short-term plan of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Tuesday to take several actions to assist farmers in response to trade damage from unjustified retaliation. President Trump directed Secretary Perdue to craft a short-term relief strategy to protect agricultural producers while the Administration works on free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals to open more markets, in the long run, to help American farmers compete globally.Specifically, the USDA will authorize up to $12 billion in support programs. This comes in line with the estimated $11 billion impact of the unjustified retaliatory tariffs on US agricultural goods. These programs will assist agricultural producers to meet the costs of disrupted markets.â€œThis is a short-term solution to allow President Trump time to work on long-term trade deals to benefit agriculture and the entire U.S. economy,â€? Secretary Perdue said in the press release.â€œThe President promised to have the back of every American farmer and rancher, and he knows the importance of keeping our rural economy strong. Unfortunately, Americaâ€™s hard-working agricultural producers have been treated unfairly by Chinaâ€™s illegal trading practices and have taken a disproportionate hit when it comes illegal retaliatory tariffs. USDA will not stand by while our hard-working agricultural producers bear the brunt of unfriendly tariffs enacted by foreign nations. The programs we are announcing today help ensure our nationâ€™s agriculture continues to feed the world and innovate to meet the demand.â€?According to the statement, USDA will use the following programs to assist farmers:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A Central Kentucky car dealer makes his sales pitch to end the Presidentâ€™s trade war.Steve Gates called himself a, â€œthird-generation car guy,â€? as he addressed the powerful Senate Finance Committee. He warned the White House plan to pump up taxes on imported steel and aluminum would be a major road block.â€œIt would be devastating,â€? he told this reporter following the hearing.Gates said car dealers and manufacturers largely absorbed the cost of current tariffs. But, he told Senators going further down the trade war road could crunch sales and lighten the wallets of every driver in the country.â€œPrice of car goes up, price of parts goes up, that means your insurance goes up,â€? he said explaining the economic ripple effect.With few exceptions â€“ Senators on the right and left in the hearing today voiced sympathy with Gatesâ€™ concern over tariffs. â€œI call tariffs a tax on American families,â€? said Committee Chairman Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT).The constitution gives congress the power to set taxes on foreign goods, but, over the last several decades, lawmakers largely left those decisions to the White House.In a break with most academics, the presidentâ€™s trade advisors argue history makes the case for tariffs. â€œThey have created prosperity, and right now the presidentâ€™s tariffs policies are doing just that,â€? National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro.Spokespeople for President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration said the policies are bringing back manufacturing jobs in places like rural Kentucky.Navarro argues the short-term pain on auto-manufacturers will be worth it if China is strong-armed into playing by international trade rules. â€œIf this president doesnâ€™t stand up for America right now, we will essentially lose our economy and manufacturing base,â€? he said.Some senators suggest itâ€™s time to reverse course and take tariff responsibility back, but for now, President Trump remains in the driverâ€™s seat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deborah Elms, executive director of lobby group the Asian Trade Centre, is decidedly opposed to tariffs in any way, shape or form, while Tony Nash, CEO and founder of Complete Intelligence, views the current situation as almost a natural evolution for a global trade system which has failed.Moderated by Alex Capri, senior fellow at the National University of Singapore Business School, the highlights of this stimulating conversation are below.Note: this conversation took place on September 4, 2018.Capri: Weâ€™re at US$50bn of US tariffs, with talk of another US$200bn possibly this week. China is talking about retaliating with US$60bn. What is the actual collateral damage right now and in the future to global supply chains, particularly in Asia?Elms: I think we should look beyond saying: â€˜If the trade war happens,â€™ or: â€˜Is this a trade dispute?â€™ This is a trade war. We are now at US$100bn in tariff levels between just the US and China. The US now has lined up an additional US$200bn in additional products â€“ expect those in the next two weeks, my guess is they will land at US$180bn. The Chinese will retaliate again, US$60bn, but then theyâ€™re out of room to do dollar-for-dollar matching of tariffs. The Chinese donâ€™t import as much in goods from the US, so theyâ€™ll have to retaliate on the rest in some other non-goods fashion. Itâ€™ll have to come in services against US companies based in China, but it wonâ€™t be on goods.The implications for Asia and supply chains are starting to bite. It took a while for this to trickle down, as much of it is slow moving. The last bit of the US$50bn from the US and Chinese didnâ€™t hit until August 23. Supply chains, which are slow to shift, havenâ€™t been moving particularly fast up until now. But as people begin to realise this isnâ€™t an â€˜ifâ€™ but a â€˜nowâ€™, and that itâ€™s not short-term, but long-term, those supply chains will shift. Many will relocate to the rest of Asia, especially the Southeast, from China.Singapore is a classic example. Many of the semiconductors produced in Singapore are exported to China to be re-exported to the US. Thatâ€™s going to hit hard in many places in the region. Those supply chains will shift over time: 25% tariffs are hard to absorb. Itâ€™s going to be a difficult transition and it will take time. The short-term implications will be painful for an awful lot of Asia â€“ there is much more of a connection between US-China supply chains than people expect.Nash: We have to define the question first. Weâ€™re dealing with institutions in the global trade environment formed immediately after the Cold War: the WTO, Nafta (North American Free Trade Agreement), the EU. It represented a trade arbitrage: Nafta in North America, the EU in the eurozone â€“ taking advantage of low cost sites within those trade blocs.When China came into the WTO it created a global trade arbitrage. Since then, Chinese wages are now loosely equivalent to Malaysian wages. China finds it hard to compete without heavy subsidies and restrictions. All of this talk about tariffs and trade war, itâ€™s really about the generational change from those institutions established post-Cold War until now.Weâ€™re in a cycle of world history where people are evaluating those institutions. The average tariff under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was 35%. Under the WTO itâ€™s 2%. Tariffs really arenâ€™t a big deal in world trade anymore. The bigger issue is subsidies, non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and regulatory issues. Since the 1980s, there has been a lot of talk about the regionalisation of supply chains. What we have with these different arbitrage opportunities, especially with China coming into play, is an impediment to the regionalisation of supply chains. Now with green movements, carbon taxes, because we have these regional blocs, weâ€™re starting to have a realisation that the regionalisation of supply chains is better for everyone â€“ better in terms of the environment, jobs and wages.In these trade disputes, Trump is the catalyst â€“ thereâ€™s no way to dress that up. You have to look at his campaign, every single statement he made had to do with jobs and wages. Everything. Heâ€™s trying to establish the landed cost of goods exported from China or Mexico or elsewhere and understand how US or regional manufacturing could be competitive. Thatâ€™s really all it is, dressed up in belligerent tweets and statements.But this is all about understanding the true landing cost, if you strip out subsidies and trade barriers, and how competitive those markets are.Capri: Weâ€™re seeing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) being negotiated and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) being embraced minus the US. Those are rules-based multilateral trading frameworks. Is that the solution? And whatâ€™s Chinaâ€™s role in all this?Elms: Most countries right now are grappling with these very difficult questions. Governments around the region are asking us about this at the top level. What are we going to do when the worldâ€™s largest player figures out that the system doesnâ€™t work to benefit the worldâ€™s largest player anymore?In Asia we have these regional agreements which can help stabilise things. Last week in Singapore we had senior ministers discussing RCEP, 16 countries here in Asia, all 10 members of Asean, plus China, Australia, Japan, Korea, India, New Zealand, meeting in intensive conversations about how Asia can link itself together as a bulwark against disruption elsewhere. The plan to have a substantial agreement this year will be difficult. Theyâ€™re close, and are in great urgency because of the disruption.But the problem with regional trade agreements is they donâ€™t cover everyone. If you happen to be sitting in an uncovered country thereâ€™s a challenge. It would be better for firms to have global agreements, but it is very difficult when the two largest players in the system are throwing arrows at each other. How quickly can we create rules in the global system that will benefit both parties and get them both back to the negotiating table?Nash: We have to understand what we mean by free trade. What is free trade? In my mind, it is removing protections that domestic companies have so foreign firms can compete on an equal basis. Itâ€™s not about tariffs or regulations. If you think in that way, the current tariff war is just one early element of that. Talking about abiding by the rules, in January 2017 the National Development and Reform Commission called me to Beijing to give a briefing on Trumpâ€™s policies: what would a Trump presidency look like? This was a closed door meeting and it also had the biggest think tank in China in the room, the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges.I told them Trumpâ€™s policies were clearly outlined on his website and speeches. When we got to talking about his trade policies, I said: â€˜This will be difficult, we will have a trade dispute and it will come down to subsidies and NTBs. Youâ€™re going to have to give on these.â€™ What was their response? The central planning agency of the Chinese government said: â€˜The Japanese and the Germans do it too!â€™ Their response wasnâ€™t: â€™We donâ€™t do that!â€™At that moment it became painfully evident to me that thereâ€™s a mass circumvention of the rules of global trade. The Chinese, you can see in their negotiations, theyâ€™re embarrassed that theyâ€™ve been found out. Itâ€™s not that they donâ€™t recognise the problem, theyâ€™re embarrassed that Trump is taking them to task very publicly.Elms: One of the problems that the Trump administration has been facing is producing the evidence. Many people ask: â€˜has China played fairlyâ€™? Thatâ€™s a difficult question to answer. But the Chinese response would be: â€˜show us where weâ€™ve violated WTO rulesâ€™. One of the things thatâ€™s been lacking thus far has been clear evidence by the US side of specific rules that have been violated.The spirit may have been a bit of an issue, but the letter of the law appears to largely have been followed. The US produced a 200-page report on IP and tech transfer in which it mostly says that China over a long period of time has violated the following of these kinds of things. But is very thin on specific evidence. If the Trump administration wants to ram the evidence home, it needs to say: â€˜Here are specific cases of specific incidents of IP theft and tech transfer today, not 10 or 12 years ago, but today.â€™ That would go a long way towards solidifying the case. Thatâ€™s why this entire argument has been hard for other countries to get around.Capri: Everyone is familiar with the situation with ZTE and Huawei, which have just been blocked from Australiaâ€™s 5G network development. How should companies in the tech sector, with global supply chains, start planning their future value chains, in light of this?Elms: Part of what the Trump administration is hoping to achieve with the tariff regime is that firms will start to reshore production back to the US. For some products thatâ€™s likely to happen.But I also think it is missing something: there are 4 billion consumers here in Asia, versus 380 million in the US. For many products, firms will decide their futures are in Asia rather than the US. They will probably outsource their production to China or Asia generally. Youâ€™ll probably see a split in supply chains. Rather than having one supply chain hub in China, producing materials and sending some to the US and some to Asia, you may see firms splitting to have some in the US and some in Asia. Companies donâ€™t often realise where their supply chain footprint lies. You may know where your first tier suppliers are, but donâ€™t have a clue where your third and fourth tier suppliers sit, until they get cut off. So now firms have a chance to look at their sourcing locations, warehousing distribution networks, and say: â€˜Does this still make sense, at a time of 25% tariffs into the US?â€™Nash: If you remember before the financial crisis, almost every manufacturing company was looking at a China plus one, two or three strategy. In China in 2012, we saw real retribution towards Japanese companies over the Senkaku Islands dispute. Two years ago, we saw retribution in China against Korean companies around these defensive missiles put on Korean territory.Two weeks ago, there was an announcement in Japan that a number of Japanese companies were rotating large portions of their manufacturing out of China. Weâ€™ve also seen the same with Korean companies, they were some of the first production line experts in China, 30 years ago. For them to rotate out of China, itâ€™s a big statement.I would say the earlier analogy would be from 2007, when there was a minimum wage imposed in the Pearl River Delta and a bunch of Korean, Japanese and Taiwanese companies backed up their trucks to the factory, shipped everything out to Vietnam and started operations there . Thereâ€™s something similar underway, but itâ€™s a much broader trend. The China-plus strategy from pre-financial crisis is underway again now.Not just because of the cost of production, but also things like industrial espionage. One example would be Operation Shady Rat, and all of these subsequent industrial espionage efforts that have taken place out of a building in Tianjin, where the Chinese government is looking into foreign companiesâ€™ IP.We are seeing a regional rotation out of China for a number of reasons, including cost and IP. Weâ€™re seeing regionalisation in North America, and that has quite a lot to do with environmental considerations as well as cost and job considerations. Thereâ€™s a number of things moving towards an inevitable regionalisation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Opinion How Israel Could Become a Casualty in Trump's Trade WarTrump could win a trade war with China, but with nearly a third of Israel's economy derived from exports, it is particularly exposed to the U.S. presidentâ€™s antics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Several of Chinaâ€™s largest companies are acknowledging that theyâ€™re concerned about risks from a trade war with the U.S.In the face of tariffs on the bulk of exports to its largest trading partner, Beijing has maintained a resolute position that it will respond with countermeasures. But some local corporations, many owned or influenced by the state, have voiced worries about the rising trade tensions in their latest earnings releases and other financial documents.For one, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, or ICBC, said late last month that a primary challenge the bank faces is increased instability and uncertainty in the international environment and intensifying global financial market volatility, especially since rising U.S.-China economic tensions may negatively affect many sectors.Thatâ€™s according to a translation of a Chinese-language mid-year report from the Beijing-based bank, the largest in the world by assets. CNBC accessed the filing through Wind, a financial terminal operated by a Shanghai-based company. Using the database, CNBC found numerous mentions of trade risks in other mainland Chinese mid-year reports, statements to analysts and financial documents in the last month.Notably, Yantai China Pet Foods laid out a detailed analysis of the potential impact from the U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s proposed 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods â€” which include dog and cat food.About 30 percent of the medium-sized companyâ€™s operating revenues come from exports to the U.S., the firm said in a report issued late Tuesday Beijing time to address concerns about a convertible bond offering.Yantai China Pet Foods said its 2017 return on assets excluding one-time items was 16.49 percent. With a 10 percent or 25 percent tariff, that would have only come out as a return of 13.16 percent or 8.31 percent, respectively, the company said.Looking ahead, the company said that, if it must bear the entire 25 percent tariff burden, then return on assets this year will be around 4.6 percent. If U.S. consumers bear half the cost of the duties, the pet food company projected 2018 return on assets of just under 6 percent. Stopping exports to the U.S. would lower return on assets to about 5 percent, Yantai China Pet Foods said.The company did note it expects increased demand in China and Europe to offset any drop in exports to the U.S. The firm also said it has a factory in the U.S. that accounts for about 15 percent of total sales.Over a two-year period, the weighted average return on assets would not fall below 6 percent, still allowing the company to issue convertible bonds, the report said.To be sure, many companies did not mention risks from rising trade tensions, or noted the impact to their business would likely be minimal.For example, rubber and plastic goods producer Anhui Zhongding Sealing said in a filing that all its products are named in the latest proposal for $200 billion worth of tariffs. However, the company noted there is no impact from the current U.S. duties, and that the worldâ€™s largest economy accounts for a relatively small proportion of the companyâ€™s global market.The CNBC analysis only covered mainland-traded Chinese stocks, known as A shares, and not those in Hong Kong, where many major Chinese companies are traded or have a dual listing.Other company mentions of the trade tensions include:China Southern Airlines: In the second half of 2018, U.S.-China trade tensions may increase downward pressure on Chinaâ€™s economy, the company said. At the same time, it added, Chinaâ€™s airline industry also faces high oil prices and fluctuations in the yuan, causing near-term challenges to operating profits.Jiangsu Sunshine: Chinaâ€™s share of textile imports into the European Union, U.S. and Japan has decreased this year, the company said. The yuanâ€™s declines, increasing U.S.-China trade tensions and rising textile industries in Vietnam and other southeast Asian countries have increased uncertainty around the development of Chinaâ€™s textile industry, according to the firm.Shanghai Pudong Development Bank: The U.S.-China trade tensions have increased uncertainty around Chinaâ€™s economic growth, the bank said.China Merchants Bank: Regarding the second half of the year, the U.S.-China trade war may increase uncertainty around the domestic economy, the Shenzhen-based bank said. As a result, it added, growth will likely slow compared with the first half of the year, putting pressure on the steady growth of credit assets and the pricing of risk assets.Guangdong Haid â€“ In the first half of the year, the company said, the feed industry was negatively impacted by consumption trends, low prices in the breeding market, promotion of environmental protection policies and U.S.-China trade tensions that caused raw material soybean meal prices to fluctuate. Not only did small and medium-sized enterprises suffer and exit the market, it added, but some large companies also faced increased difficulties of weak growth and even declines in sales and profits.Source: CNBC",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Trade conflict between the United States and China could further boost already booming grain and oilseed exports from the Black Sea region, traders and analysts said.New opportunities to sell wheat, corn and soybeans to China and even the European Union are set to open up for the regionâ€™s main exporters Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, whose recent ascendancy has already ended full U.S. dominance in markets such as Nigeria and Mexico.The United States and China slapped tit-for-tat duties on $34 billion of each otherâ€™s imports on Friday, with Beijing accusing Washington of triggering the â€œlargest-scale trade warâ€?.The Black Sea regionâ€™s share of the international wheat market climbed to about 37 percent in 2017/18, according to the International Grains Council, comfortably topping the United States and Canada combined.China is the worldâ€™s top wheat producer but still imports about 4 million tonnes of the grain each year.In the 2017/18 season (June/May) the United States exported 902,400 tonnes of wheat to China, down from 1.56 million in the prior season, according to U.S. government data.For Kazakh wheat, the pick-up in Chinese imports started due to Beijingâ€™s Belt Road policy and before the trade dispute took off, but the tariff row accentuates the trend.â€œWe have just started buying wheat from Kazakhstan this year. Our first order was for several thousand tonnes,â€? a Chinese wheat trader said. â€œWe will see about sales and profits. If theyâ€™re good, we will increase imports for sure. It is related to the current trade war.â€?â€œNow that you canâ€™t bring in American wheat, it gives us more incentive to buy from Kazakhstan. And once your trading of Kazakh wheat reaches a certain volume, you get government preferential support,â€? the trader added.Among the risks for this strategy are difficult logistics and unstable quality seen in Kazakh and Russian wheat, said another trader who has been looking for more Kazakh wheat deals.Black Sea wheat may not be able fully to replace its U.S. counterpart due to different quality grades, meaning some traders will also turn to Canadian wheat, he added.According to statistical data, Russia and Ukraine, whose traditional buyers had been in North Africa and the Middle East, boosted wheat supplies to Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Spain, Tunisia, Tanzania, Sudan, Oman, Mexico and Kenya in the 2017/18 season.One location in which Russia has taken away from U.S. wheat market share is Nigeria, which like Brazil traditionally favors a higher-protein grain such as U.S. hard red winter.PRICES LOUDER THAN WORDSIn a sign that may worry some U.S. wheat traders further, Brazil bought Russian wheat in July for the first time in eight years.â€œIn this new era of trade wars, prices talk louder than words,â€? said Swithun Still, director of Solaris, which specializes in trading Russian agricultural commodities.â€œItâ€™s likely that China will aim to buy more grains and oilseeds from the Black Sea and more beans from South America. Mexico has been buying lots of Russian wheat and will continue as prices are attractive compared to U.S. wheat,â€? he added.The trade spat could also boost exports of Black Sea corn and soybeans.Russian authorities recently reported a record 850,000 tonnes of soybean exports to China in July 2017-May 2018, more than double the 340,000 tonnes a year earlier, Svetlana Malysh, Kiev-based Black Sea agriculture market analyst at Thomson Reuters, said.â€œBlack Sea countries, mainly Russia, may intensify their soybean shipments to China in case of any U.S. deliveriesâ€™ disruption,â€? she added.The trade conflict is also a chance for Ukraine to boost supplies of its corn to the European Union, which imposed a 25 percent import duty on U.S. corn in June, Malysh said.China can also turn to Ukraine and Russia for corn in case it reduces purchases from the United States, according to Matt Ammermann, commodity risk manager with INTL FCStone.Source: Reuters (Additional reporting by Michael Hirtzer and Natalia Zinets; Editing by Nigel Hunt and Dale Hudson)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As China marks the 40th anniversary of its reforms, Beijing has already announced that it will hold a grand commemoration at the end of the year, and officials have recently cranked up the propaganda about reforms. But besides paying tribute to the glory of past reforms, will Beijing announce a new round of changes and return to the path of Deng Xiaopingâ€™s reforms? Thatâ€™s unclear to the outside world.Meanwhile, most people in civil society, and even inside the system, are pessimistic about reforms. More than 10 years ago, when some liberal intellectuals chanted the slogan â€œReform is deadâ€?, society might not have agreed; now, this has basically become the social consensus.Against this background, a recent seminar held by an influential Chinese think tank, the China Economists 50 Forum, has ignited public expectations that China will restart its reforms. This is due to the attendance of Liu He, who is President Xi Jinpingâ€™s chief economic adviser, the maker of Chinaâ€™s economic policies, and vice-premier.The China Economists 50 Forum is an academic organisation with the mission of advancing Chinaâ€™s reforms. Its members basically include Chinaâ€™s top economics scholars, as well as retired and incumbent senior officials who are also academics â€“ Liu is one of them.In general, officials at the vice-premier level do not attend or participate in non-official seminars. This is not only a question of time and itinerary, but also because the outside world ascribes political motivations to the officialsâ€™ actions and activities. If they attend a seminar, it shows the seminar has a political purpose that needs to be highlighted by their attendance.And this is how Liuâ€™s participation in the China Economists 50 Forum was seen. At the seminar, the top scholars spoke boldly of reform, different in tone from official propaganda. If these words had been spoken by an outside scholar, or an unimportant scholar inside the system, they would have sounded like grievances. But these scholars are deeply involved in Chinaâ€™s economic decision-making â€“ some of the scholar-officials were or are policymakers â€“ and the same words spoken by them gained a different meaning.For example, Yang Weimin was a deputy director of the powerful Office of the Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs and is now a deputy director of the Economic Affairs Committee of the Chinese Peopleâ€™s Political Consultative Conference. At the seminar, he criticised the official reforms as â€œsmall reformâ€? and â€œfake reformâ€?. Calling for accelerated, comprehensive and deep reforms of the system in a new era â€“ real changes that â€œcrunch hard bonesâ€? â€“ he proposed reforms from eight aspects, including the reduction of the governmentâ€™s power to decide resource allocation.Considering he was Liuâ€™s deputy at the Central Leading Group, Yangâ€™s relatively complete proposal could, to some extent, be regarded as an expression of Liuâ€™s views. However, it would still be a stretch to interpret the seminar as a signal that China is restarting its reforms. At best, it was a gathering of scholars and officials who are dissatisfied with the current situation and hope Beijing will undertake what they believe to be real reforms.But there is great uncertainty about whether Beijing will accept their suggestions, and how far Chinaâ€™s reforms can go. We wonâ€™t know until the end of the year, the reason being that, at the moment, Beijing does not have the will to undertake political reform.The question of political reform was sidestepped by the top scholars at the seminar, probably because they realised it could not be discussed and it would be useless to talk about it. Yet, they all know it is impossible to carry out real economic reforms without making political changes. Authoritarian power is not compatible with the market economy, and ultimately compromises market efficiency.So what is Liu Heâ€™s attitude towards political reform? It now seems that although the trade war has not diminished his role as Xiâ€™s key economic adviser, he is cautious about political reform and has a limited right to speak about it, if at all.I donâ€™t doubt that Liu himself believes in the market economy. He should know that further marketisation of the Chinese economy would inevitably require corresponding changes in the governmental and political systems. Yet, in the past few years, Chinese politics has made a left turn â€“ a trend Liu has failed to stop.A key item in Yangâ€™s proposal called for the reduction of the governmentâ€™s power to allocate resources, which is not about to happen soon, considering the state of Chinaâ€™s reforms in recent years.Moreover, the party is more powerful than the government now, and controls everything; the behind-the-scenes power to decide resource allocation has already been transferred from the government to the party. Under the circumstances, anyone who wants to reform the party system will be accused by rivals of weakening the partyâ€™s leadership, and this is a political risk those reform-minded senior officials are unwilling to take. Also, the supreme power has shown no sign of willingness to reform the party.But if the party and the government donâ€™t change, there are no grounds to talk about large-scale tax and fee reductions. This is actually why the government keeps introducing tax cuts, but enterprises actually feel their tax burden increasing.Similarly, if the party and the governmentâ€™s functions stay unchanged, party-controlled, state-owned enterprises will not be able to marketise and become more efficient. To survive and develop, these SOEs will then rely further on national support, squeezing the development space for the private economy.Having said that, reforms are not a lost cause. Facing external pressure from the trade war with the United States, the Chinese authorities may have no choice but to make limited reforms.On top of previous tariffs on US$50 billion of Chinese goods, US President Donald Trump has decided to impose 10 per cent tariffs on US$200 billion of Chinese goods, and is threatening to tax the remaining US$260 billion-plus. This will undoubtedly exacerbate Chinaâ€™s economic difficulties and might even plunge the country into a crisis.To avoid social unrest, the authorities could respond with reforms: relax their control of the economy, curb the expansion pace of SOEs, and allow the private economy to develop more rapidly. As part of a plan to support peopleâ€™s livelihoods, tax cuts should be implemented, the government should be trimmed, and incomes lifted. The economy should be driven by domestic demand and rely less on external markets.Such reforms are very likely. And although reforms of this kind cannot solve Chinaâ€™s fundamental problems and meet peopleâ€™s demands for democracy, they would release the vitality of Chinese society, resolve the difficulties created by the trade war and tide Beijing over.From this perspective, Trump may be the greatest midwife of Chinaâ€™s reforms.Source: South China Morning Post",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To put the ongoing noise about possibe trade wars into perspective, EU-US trade in goods was worth about â‚¬600 billion ($710 billion) in 2016, while the US imported â‚¬5 billion worth of European steel and exported a mere â‚¬1 billion.As Bloomberg pointed out, this would then be a trade war whose effects would probably be smaller than statistical anomalies.According to the US Census Bureau, the US goods trade deficit with the EU was $146.7 billion in 2016, while the EU puts its surplus with the US at â‚¬112.9 billion (at the average exchange rate for 2016, that is $125.3 billion).This $21.4 billion â€˜asymmetryâ€™ would cover the US steel and aluminum trade deficit four times over. The differences are even bigger for services, where both parties claim a surplus.â€œTrump is quite right on a number of things,â€? ifo trade expert Gabriel Felbermayr told DW, pointing to EU tariffs on cars of 10 percent and EU food barriers, where on average, the EU charges 5.2 percent and the US 3.5 percent.â€œBut he has a distorted perception of EU-US trade relations,â€? Felbermayr said. â€œHe only talks about the US deficit in goods, but forgets to mention that the US is running a massive surplus against the EU in services and corporate profits.â€?Before the G7 summit, Trump had said in a tweet that the US was running a deficit of $151 billion with the EU, although according to its own figures, the US is running a surplus of $14 billion on its current account balance with the EU and has been in surplus since 2008.Germany is not the EUOf crucial importance, however, at least for Trump, is US Department of Commerce data that show a US current account deficit with Germany of $65 billion.â€œIt is wrong to pick out individual EU member states. The EU is a customs and economic union in which individual member states are closely linked. The US surplus of almost $100 billion with the Netherlands is largely due to Germany,â€? Felbermayr said.US internet giants access the German market via headquarters in the Netherlands for tax purposes, with a similar pattern seen in Ireland, he added.Others argue that some of the trade imbalances are down to simple old-fashioned competitive advantages.For example, diesel-powered vehicles â€” which make up 39 percent of Germanyâ€™s car market â€” fell 20 percent in the first three months of 2018 after a German court banned diesel emissions in some cities, but even if tariff barriers were dropped, â€œthe German auto market is unlikely to be under threat from an influx of US cars, given consumer preferences for smaller more fuel efficient cars in the EU,â€? BMI said in a note recently.The US has enjoyed a competitive advantage in the New Economy, and especially in digital services with Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Co, Felbermayr said. â€œIn the Old Economy of car manufacturing, machinery, various consumer goods and even in the food industry, by contrast, the EU has a competitive advantage,â€? Felbermayr said.But cars can still hurtIn response to Trumpâ€™s threatened tariffs on European imports such as steel and aluminum, the EU threatened to slap a 25 percent duty on jeans, cosmetics, bourbon and Harley Davidson motorcycles â€” perhaps a deliberately cartoonish list of US products that seemed designed to paint Trumpâ€™s attempted trade war as farcical.But as this phony war rumbles on in largely symbolic terrain, the sense that Trump may in fact be serious increases.â€œWe believe the far bigger prize for the White House is auto exports, most significantly from Germany,â€? BMI analysts wrote in a recent note to clients.The US Commerce Department recently launched an investigation that could reportedly result in a 25 percent auto-import tax. EU cars to the US today face a 2.5 percent tax, while US cars to the EU face a 10 percent tax at least.â€œEuropeans do not understand the Red States. Trump is an egomaniac, but he does exactly what he said he is gonna do,â€? an American businessman living in Germany for 30 years told DW.Bernhard Mattes, the new head of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, meanwhile, said recently that a trade war must be â€œavoided by all means.â€?The German car industry relies heavily on the US market. In 2017, its US revenues were â‚¬29.4 billion and 1.3 million German vehicles were sold in the country, 10 percent of total production. The industry directly or indirectly provides 2 million German jobs.Of these 1.3 million vehicles, 800,000 were built in US factories and many more were made in German factories in Mexico, part of the NAFTA.The estimated losses in the luxury-vehicle market alone could be â‚¬4.5 billion on up to 600,000 units and BMW would likely be hit the hardest, followed by Volkswagen and Daimler, experts said.BMW has the highest level of US-sourced vehicles of the three, at 35 percent. Volkswagen and Daimler have 17 percent and 26 percent. Companies with no factories in the US, including Volkswagen-controlled Audi and Porsche, are also vulnerable.Caught in US-China trade war crosshairsGerman carmakers with big US operations like BMW â€” Americaâ€™s largest exporter of cars â€” and Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler would also be hit by proposed Chinese import tariffs on US imports.Beijing has threatened to double tariffs to 50 percent on imported cars in retaliation against Trumpâ€™s proposed tariffs on products including vehicles and automotive parts.â€œThe Germans stand to lose the most in absolute terms if the tariffs are enforced,â€? a study by asset managers AllianceBernstein in April showed.IHS has estimated that BMW will export 89,000 vehicles from the US to China in 2018, while Mercedes will export 65,000, making them the biggest US-China exporters.Tough talk and glimmers of hopeGerman Economy Minister Peter Altmaier called on Monday for European states to close ranks in the trade dispute with the US, while Chancellor Angela Merkel threatened Trump with retaliation in an appearance on German broadcaster ARD on Sunday evening.â€œBoth trade partners are extremely vulnerable. Both stand to lose from an escalating trade war. Europe now needs to unite and explain US figures to the Americans. Europe also needs to signal retaliatory measures in the digital sector like the digital tax discussed by the EU Commission, if the Americans decide to impose tariffs on European cars,â€? Felbermayr warned.The German car industry is lobbying Republican politicians with German car plants in their home states, with Daimler targeting Republicans in Alabama, home to its big US factory, while BMW is hoping it can do the same in South Carolina, where its Spartanburg plant, the companyâ€™s largest globally, is based, employing 10,000 people, many of its cars being exported to China.Source: DW",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a round of interviews and media briefings on Wednesday, Trump administration officials downplayed the risk of a U.S. trade war with China, insisting tariff threats are just the first round in negotiations.The concerted attempt to calm market nerves came after the two countries each published a list of potential targets for higher tariffs in a dispute over intellectual property and technology transfer.â€œThereâ€™s no trade war here,â€? the U.S. presidentâ€™s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said in an interview with Fox Business Network (â€œKudlow: there is absolutely not a trade warâ€?, Real Clear Politics, April 4).â€œWhat youâ€™ve got is the early stages of a process which will include tariffs, comments on the tariffs, then ultimate decisions and negotiations. There are already back-channel talks going on,â€? Kudlow said.â€œThese are just the first proposals â€¦ weâ€™re putting it out for comment, itâ€™s going to take a couple of months, I doubt there will be any concrete action for several months.â€?The same talking points were echoed by other senior officials including Trumpâ€™s press secretary, his commerce secretary and his hawkish foreign trade adviser.The soothing message appeared to work, with U.S. equity indices reversing earlier losses as investors concluded the risk of threatened tariffs actually being imposed was low.But investors and traders are probably underestimating the difficulty of the negotiations and the risk the United States and China could drift into a damaging confrontation by accident.NEGOTIATING STRATEGYThe threat to impose additional 25 percent tariffs on imports from China worth up to $50 billion fits with the Trump administrationâ€™s typical negotiating pattern.In general, the administration starts by making an aggressive and openly controversial announcement to drive an issue up the agenda, control the framing, and create leverage, before settling down to negotiate the details in private.It has already employed this approach by threatening to leave free trade agreements with Canada, Mexico and South Korea, as well as with steel and aluminium tariffs.Outside the trade area, it has used the same strategy to demand changes to the nuclear agreement with Iran, denuclearisation of North Korea, more burden-sharing by NATO allies, a border wall with Mexico, and to deal with the problem of undocumented child migrants.So far the results have been mixed. The South Korea free trade agreement has reportedly been renegotiated with some minor changes and there has been some progress with NATO, but none of the other negotiations has yet reached a successful conclusion.In employing the same tactics with China, the administration has picked a much more formidable negotiating adversary and opened up a more complicated set of issues.There is no guarantee the negotiations will reach a successful conclusion and avoid imposition of the threatened tariffs.So while negotiations may be able to avert tariffs, there is a non-zero probability that they will fail to achieve a solution.The process itself is likely to be a source of considerable uncertainty for businesses in both countries as well as third parties in their supply chains for months.Most market participants are probably underestimating how difficult the negotiations will prove and the risk of failure or at least repeated bouts of tension.The administrationâ€™s mixed messages are themselves a source of confusion.Senior U.S. officials are trying to convince investors tariffs are unlikely to be imposed so as not to trigger a fall in equity prices or business confidence.But for its hardline negotiating strategy to work, the administration must convince China and other countries the threat to impose tariffs is very real.NARROWING DIFFERENCESThe United States has presented a long list of grievances as part of its Section 301 investigation into technology transfer (â€œNotice of determinationâ€?, United States Trade Representative, April 3).But it is part of a wider set of disputes between the United States and China that cover intellectual property, subsidisation, dumping, government ownership of enterprises and restrictions on market access as well as the overall trade imbalance.U.S. policymakers have questioned almost every aspect of Chinaâ€™s economic model, which is in turn deeply embedded in the countryâ€™s social and political system.Achieving wholesale change will not be possible. No country would allow another to impose changes to its fundamental social-economic-political model (short of defeat in war).So the United States will have to narrow its demands to a list of specific and realistic steps that China will be able to take.Washington will also need to provide reassurance that once a deal is done, it will not be re-opened in future with demands for even more concessions.PLAYING CHICKENCritically, any deal must allow both sides to save face and avoid the appearance China is making unilateral concessions under pressure.Even before the tariffs were announced, China and the United States had been trying to negotiate a deal over technology transfer, intellectual property and other issues.By increasing the political temperature, the reciprocal tariff announcements have probably made it harder rather than easier to achieve an outcome acceptable to both sides.China has already reiterated it will not negotiate and make concessions under external pressure (â€œChina says it never backs down in the face of threats after trade salvos with U.S.â€?, Reuters, April 4).U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinaâ€™s President Xi Jinping have each cultivated an image as a strong leader so neither can afford to back down and be seen as weak in front of a domestic audience.The two sides are engaged in a dangerous game of chicken (â€œChina trade brinkmanship: Beijingâ€™s retaliation for Trumpâ€™s tariffs hits Trumpâ€™s voters hardâ€?, Wall Street Journal, April 4).The negotiating process could easily drag on for six months or more, creating significant uncertainty for business in the meantime and complicating investment decisions.Businesses will have to start to plan for the imposition of tariffs on their supply chain even if they are never imposed. Even the threat of tariffs has real consequences for investment and trade flows.While the most likely outcome is probably a deal, there is a non-zero and probably significant risk of breakdown.For the moment, markets are assuming the negotiations will succeed, but investors should probably start to take more seriously the possibility of failure and price it in.Source: Reuters (Editing by Catherine Evans)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Policy makers across Southeast Asia are bracing for a fallout from a U.S.-China trade war, turning their focus on bolstering their domestic markets to cushion the blow.Chinaâ€™s proposal Wednesday for an additional 25 percent tariff on about $50 billion of U.S. imports ratcheted up the tension between the worldâ€™s two largest economies, rocking global markets and keeping officials on guard for ripple effects.Indonesia Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati and Bank of Thailand Governor Veerathai Santiprabhob, who are attending a regional meeting of officials in Singapore, said on Thursday the conflict will have global repercussions, even if the direct impact on Southeast Asiaâ€™s gross domestic product may be minimal for now.â€œThe composition of our GDP is mostly fueled by consumptionâ€? and the government is aiming to boost investment to further diversify economic growth beyond exports, Indrawati said in an interview with Bloomberg Televisionâ€™s Haslinda Amin. She added that the deteriorating trade relations between the U.S. and China and prospects for further retaliation â€œis not going to serve the interests of both parties.â€?U.S. President Donald Trump is attempting to upend the global trade framework, arguing that Chinaâ€™s trade practices are unfair, with alleged violations including intellectual property theft and export subsidies. Indrawati, a former World Bank managing director, said those differences should be dealt with through the World Trade Organization rather than erecting tariff barriers.Currency SurgeChina is the biggest trading partner for many Southeast Asian economies and an important source of investment and tourism in the region. While large domestic markets in Indonesia and the Philippines help to shelter those economies from a trade war, other economies in the region, like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, are more reliant on exports.Indrawati said sheâ€™s still optimistic that Indonesia would meet its GDP growth target for this year of 5.4 percent, a slight pick-up from 5.1 percent in 2017.Veerathai said in a separate Bloomberg Television interview that the U.S.-China trade developments are â€œdefinitely something we have to monitor very closelyâ€? and that retaliatory actions are of great concern, but that so far â€œthe direct impacts have been quite small.â€?The central bank has been trying to manage the currencyâ€™s appreciation so it doesnâ€™t undermine the competitiveness of exports as the trade environment becomes more challenging. At the same time, it has to avoid being singled out by the U.S. as a possible currency manipulator.â€˜Win-Winâ€™â€œAs the central bank, we have to step in to ensure that the pace of appreciation is not damaging the economy as a whole,â€? the governor said. â€œWe have to be careful on the impact of currency movement, in terms of volatility and the pace of appreciation on the real sector.â€?Malaysia is seeking an exemption from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum shipments and to gain clarity on the solar-based equipment penalties, Trade Minister Mustapa Mohamed said in Parliament on Thursday. The government has requested to meet with U.S. trade representatives April 17 to sort out a deal.Elsewhere in Asia, authorities are also worried about the impact on their economies. Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan wrote in a blog post Wednesday that the disputes would â€œinevitably impede relevant trade activitiesâ€? and also could negatively impact his economy. Last year, Chinaâ€™s exports to the U.S. that were routed through Hong Kong represented about 7 percent of the territoryâ€™s exports, he said.Joaquim Levy, managing director and chief financial officer at the World Bank, said heâ€™s optimistic the trade disputes will be resolved.â€œAt the end, people see that there are many ways to get to a win-win situation, so we are confident it will prevail,â€? he said in a Bloomberg Television interview Thursday. â€œThere is so much scope because trade is something that usually expands your frontiers, so that is the natural way where things should gravitate.â€?Source: Bloomberg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Trump administrationâ€™s trade war with China is following an increasingly predictable pattern and that should cause a rethink for anybody hoping for a rapid resolution.The day after financial markets around the world cheered the apparent good news that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was inviting his Chinese counterparts to sit down for further high-level negotiations, President Donald Trump undermined that very idea.â€œWe are under no pressure to make a deal with China, they are under pressure to make a deal with us,â€? Trump said on Twitter on Thursday. â€œOur markets are surging, theirs are collapsing. We will soon be taking in Billions in Tariffs & making products at home. If we meet, we meet?â€?The move marked just the latest instance of Trump undercutting one of his senior China deal-makers in public and illustrates why Beijing has become increasingly frustrated with its interactions with the U.S. administration. It also comes as Trump has repeatedly signaled his desire to continue raising pressure on Beijing and is considering the details of new tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports or even more.After last yearâ€™s Mar-a-Lago summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was given the task of negotiating a 100-day deal with China intended to be the first building block in a bigger deal.Ross and his team, however, were quickly criticized for being too obsequious to the Chinese, especially after he hailed a reheated series of commitments by Beijing as a â€œHerculeanâ€? victory for the president. Since then, the commitments Ross has brought home to Trump have repeatedly been rejected by the president.Likewise, just days after hosting Liu He, Xiâ€™s top economic emissary, in the Oval Office in May, Trump made a very public U-turn by declaring that he would be proceeding with tariffs despite Mnuchinâ€™s declaration that the trade war was â€œon hold.â€?The result has left Mnuchin discredited with Beijing as an interlocutor, according to people who have met with senior Chinese officials in recent weeks.No Giveawaysâ€œThey are certainly open to overtures because they would like to bring this trade dispute to some kind of resolution. But I donâ€™t think they are going to give anything to Mnuchin,â€? said Eswar Prasad, a former China division chief at the International Monetary Fund who now teaches at Cornell University and is close to policymakers in Beijing.â€œThey donâ€™t know if any deal they make with Mnuchin can stick,â€? Prasad said. â€œMnuchin is being seen as one voice of reason but a voice of reason without any clout.â€?Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute, is blunter: â€œThe Chinese have been very explicit that they donâ€™t think Mnuchin can deliver a deal,â€? he said.Some analysts do see a grand strategy at work.Edward Alden, a trade expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, likened the emerging pattern on China to the Nafta negotiations with Mexico and Canada, which are nearing an end after a year of intense negotiations that have been accompanied by repeated threats from Trump. Likewise, every carrot to Beijing is accompanied by a tweeted stick.â€œI think we are finally moving into the serious stage in which there is going to be the serious negotiation that we havenâ€™t had yet,â€? Alden said.Like most analysts, however, Alden doesnâ€™t expect a resolution any time soon.The pressure is clearly building on Trump to cut a deal, according to David Dollar, who was the U.S. Treasuryâ€™s man in Beijing during the Obama administration and is now at the Brookings Institution.Companies and investors are increasingly concerned about the potential impact of an escalating trade war with China on profits and the economy, which ought to be putting pressure on Trump to strike an agreement.â€œThis is the big cloud on the horizon right nowâ€? for the U.S. economy and financial markets, Dollar said.The administration also faces the likelihood that its plans for tariffs on $200 billion in additional Chinese imports and others to follow will begin to hit consumers more directly, something that unnerves Republicans looking warily at the mid-term elections and polls showing a Democratic wave building.Yet Trumpâ€™s latest China tweet also highlights how â€œeach side is sensing a vulnerability in the other and they are both wrong,â€? Dollar said.Chinese EconomyWhile Trump believes the Chinese economy is suffering, Dollar said the reality is that exports to the U.S. only account for 3 percent of Chinaâ€™s gross domestic product, with multinational companies with supply chains dependent on China as likely to suffer as Beijing.Likewise, officials in Beijing have been reading the opposition from business and Republican concerns about the mid-terms as a potential Trump weakness. But that ignores the strength of the U.S. economy and what has been the resilience of financial markets so far in the face of any trade fears.The Chinese may look at the Mnuchin invitation and think Trump â€œis starting to blink. But I donâ€™t think that is true,â€? said Dollar.Increasingly, for those reasons and others the expectation in Washington is that the U.S.-China trade war will extend well into 2019. And even that it may never see a clean resolution.Cold WarIn China, officials have begun to contemplate the possibility of a new Cold War with the U.S., Dollar said. Which is how hawks in the Trump administration such as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and trade adviser Peter Navarro see it as well, arguing for tariffs as just one tool to engineer a long-term decoupling of the worldâ€™s two largest economies.With those dynamics in mind Chinese policymakers have begun to realize that any solution to their growing trade problems with the U.S. may in the end depend on them negotiating a peace directly with Trumpâ€™s hawks, said Prasad.â€œThat is exactly their read,â€? he said. â€œIt is only by negotiating with the hardliners that they will make progress.â€?But with Trumpâ€™s hawks convinced they are in an existential battle with China and likely to demand deep and long-term changes from Beijing that it is likely to resist, such a negotiation will be difficult, Prasad said. It may also never yield the end to the trade war so many are hoping for.Source: Bloomberg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite efforts some weeks ago to reach agreement, the U.S.-Chinese trade war has intensified. Both sides have announced new tariffs on each otherâ€™s products. Beijing has called Donald Trump a â€œbully,â€? while the president has accused China of interfering with this countyâ€™s elections and, seemingly in an effort to outflank Beijing, has pressed trade deals with South Korea, Japan, and the European Union (EU). Trump shows no sign of softening. Nor do the Chinese. For the time being, domestic and geopolitical considerations prevent each from backing down.Bleak as prospects appear at the moment, the odds nonetheless favor some sort of an accommodation, perhaps not tomorrow but in the not too distant future. On the American side, there is pressure to end this from domestic firms that rely on Chinese imports. On the Chinese side, as the following discussion will make clear, the countryâ€™s export-led, manufacturing growth model always left Beijing at a disadvantage in this dispute.Figures on U.S.-China trade put Chinaâ€™s disadvantages into sharp relief. According to UN figures, the United States depends on China to buy only some 8% of all U.S. exports, whereas China depends on the United States to buy almost one-quarter of all its exports. U.S. goods and services constitute only some 7.3% of all Chinese imports, whereas Chinese products account for over 21% of all American imports.What these figures say is that a cession of trade would hurt Chinaâ€™s real economy much more than it would the U.S. economy. And indeed, the Standard and Charter Bank of Hong Kong, clearly close to the situation from the Asian side, estimates that the existing 10% tariffs imposed by Trump will slow Chinese economic growth some 0.4 percentage points next year, and if Trump raises the tariffs to 25% on January 1 as planned, it will cut Chinaâ€™s real growth pace 0.6 percentage points, not a small disruption even an economy growing 6-6.5% a year. Meanwhile, a consensus of economists here in the States estimates that the tariffs imposed by China on U.S. products will slow this economy a mere 0.1-0.2 percentage points.These figures also say that China will have an increasingly hard time matching the U.S. tariffs dollar-for-dollar, as Beijing has tried to do so far in this dispute. Indeed, the problem has already arisen. The recently announced 10% tariffs will fall on some $200 billion of Chinese products imported into this country. China has countered with 5-10% tariffs on $60 billion worth of American products entering that country. This latest raft of Chinese tariff making has brought the total on which China has raised duties to $110 billion, awfully close to the $150 billion total that country imports from the United States. Beijing is loath to burden the other $40 billion of U.S. imports because they consist of semiconductors and other components essential to Chinaâ€™s huge output of assembled electronics.Recognizing these constraints, Beijing has already announced a turn to what spokespeople describe as â€œasymmetrical tariffs.â€? Instead of raising levies in tandem with Washingtonâ€™s actions, official China now threatens to impose larger percentages on selected U.S. goods and services, obviously those Chinaâ€™s export-manufacturing machine depends on least. These, the implication is, will land heavily on agricultural products flowing across the Pacific. The Chinese consumer may object to a larger bill at the supermarket, or the Chinese equivalent, but from Beijingâ€™s point of view, a rising cost of food is an easier political problem to deal with than is doing any further damage to Chinese industry. Besides, China has other food sources beyond American farming. This is a viable response, but it also points up the inescapable fact that Beijing finds itself in a difficult position in this escalating game.While Beijing seeks alternatives to counter Washington, its economy has already begun to show signs of strain. Chinaâ€™s index of purchasing by industry, a key indicator of economic activity especially in manufacturing heavy China, has begun to decline. Regional figures from the countryâ€™s 29 provinces show 21 doing worse than last year. This time in 2017, that figure was 15. Small and medium-sized business reports layoffs at double-digit rates. Larger firms report less harm, with employment declines of 3-4%, but this might understate the pressure since it includes many state-owned firms. To be sure, China was slowing even before the tariff competition began, but some of these recent setbacks surely reflect the trade war. Export-oriented factories report the worst figures. According to preliminary surveys, their orders have dropped by half. Firms have already begun to shift output to Vietnam and Cambodia where they can both avoid Trumpâ€™s tariffs, and, significantly, pay lower wages than in China.Despite all Chinaâ€™s problems and disadvantages in this competition, Beijing will likely hang tough, at least for a while. Itâ€™s brag to the world and its own people that it has joined the major powers of the earth simply makes it impossible to bow to U.S. demands. Nonetheless, the pressures will build making it increasingly advantageous to find some source of relief. At the same time, Trump, for all his competitive advantages in this game will face pressures of his own. Agriculture, already targeted by China, has tremendous lobbying prowess. Consumers, who have grown accustomed to inexpensive Chinese imports, will in time add their voice to pleas for relief. This country also has many industries that depend on Chinese goods. It is noteworthy that in all the White Houseâ€™s bluster, it has exempted from the tariffs 300 Chinese products worth about $50 billion a year. Each is something that American business needs and cannot get elsewhere, at least not at a reasonable price point.In coming months and quarters, as these respective pressures have their increasing effect, albeit very differently in Beijing and Washington, both parties will become increasingly eager to seek an agreement. It probably will include elements that allow both Beijing and Washington to claim a victory of sorts, but it will end this tariff war, more likely in a stretch of time measured in quarters than in years.Source: Forbes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The trade fight between the worldâ€™s two economic titans is about to make dozens of household goods more expensive for U.S. shoppers, but thousands of miles away in China, consumers look set to escape much of the pain.President Donald Trump is said to be intending to pull the trigger on tariffs targeting $200 billion of Chinese imports once a deadline for public input closes Thursday. Such a move â€” his biggest salvo in the fight with China so far â€” hits at the heart of the American household, risking price increases for everyday items from refrigerators and freezers to cutlery and towels.Beijing has vowed to retaliate, but the targets they have selected and the fact Chinaâ€™s imports of U.S.-made goods are dwarfed by what it exports, means the worldâ€™s biggest consumer market will be largely shielded from the spat.The countryâ€™s counter-punch tariffs on $60 billion of imports from the U.S. focus on manufacturing components, chemicals and medical instruments. And many of the ready-to-buy American goods that will be subject to duties by the Chinese government are hardly mass-market: yachts, riding crops and false beards.â€œMostly, itâ€™s going to be absorbed by Chinese corporates instead of consumers,â€? said Larry Hu, a Hong Kong-based economist at Macquarie Securities Ltd. â€œAt the bottom line, the direct impact is very small.â€?The differing lists of tariffs drawn up by the U.S. and China reflect the trade imbalances between the two nations. U.S. imports from China were about $505 billion in 2017, much of it electronic goods, household furnishings and clothing. Only $130 billion of products, including soybeans, aircraft, machinery and plastics went the other way, reflecting Chinaâ€™s role as a manufacturing base, U.S. figures show.New data out Wednesday showed the U.S. goods deficit with China in the seven months through July this year widened about 8 percent to $234 billion from the same period in 2017.That trade-flow mismatch is helping President Xi Jinping protect Chinese consumers from the conflict, partly because he has comparatively fewer U.S. imports to tax. But if Trump follows through with tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports, it will be tough for American households to emerge unscathed. Heâ€™s threatened duties on even more Made-In-China goods if Beijing retaliates.To be sure, Chinese consumers may see some less direct fallout from the tariff hit, via the cost of food. In July, China slapped tariffs on a range of U.S. agricultural products including soybeans, corn and sorghum, used to feed pigs in the worldâ€™s biggest pork-producing nation.The combination of those levies on $50 billion of imports from the U.S., and the $60 billion under consideration, could ultimately inflate shopping bills if manufacturers and food producers pass the costs on to customers, according to Morgan Stanley economists. The bump to consumer prices could be 0.3 percentage points, they said in a Sept. 3 report. That said, China has also indicated it will just source its pig feed elsewhere.According to Hu at Macquarie, broad economic uncertainty stoked by the trade conflict could do more damage than the tariffs alone. At worst, Chinese households might become fearful of buying big-ticket items like cars, he said.Chinaâ€™s plans for tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods includes an additional 5 percent on U.S. products including planes and dairy machinery, and another 10 percent on items including wigs and textiles. Thereâ€™s an extra 20 percent on some chemicals and paper, and an additional 25 percent on products such as meat and wheat.But beyond these tariffs, China canâ€™t match Trumpâ€™s threats dollar for dollar. The government would have to retaliate in other ways, such as increased regulation of U.S. companies in China â€” measures that donâ€™t directly put the consumer in the firing line.Either way, Chinese households look protected for now. â€œItâ€™s not going to have a big impact on Chinese consumer prices,â€? said Macquarieâ€™s Hu.Source: Bloomberg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the trade war between the worldâ€™s two largest economies further escalates, with US$16 billion in tariffs and counter-tariffs between the United States and China coming into effect, a deep-seated conflict is emerging. Behind the USâ€™ attack on Chinaâ€™s forced technology transfer policy, intellectual property theft and Made in China 2025 strategic plan, and behind the tit-for-tat tariffs, there lies a fundamental fault line of the trade war: the clash between the Chinese state-dominated economic model and the US-led free-market economy system.Judging by his tariffs on allies and his embrace of a dictator, it appears that US President Donald Trump doesnâ€™t typically care about ideological or political views as long as they align with his â€œAmerica firstâ€? policy. However, the attack on Made in China 2025, a plan to develop Chinaâ€™s hi-tech industries, has seemingly, intentionally or not, turned into an assault on the core of Chinaâ€™s political and economic system. The Chinese model is characterised by its government-led and -supported industrial growth and innovation that includes elements such as state-owned enterprises in key sectors, government-guided industrial policy and cheap credit from banks.This challenge to Beijingâ€™s economic model gained bipartisan support from elite groups within Washingtonâ€™s China-policymaking community. It seems they are no longer under the illusion that China can be incorporated into the USâ€™ free-market capitalism, and they think their China policy over the past two decades has failed.Since Chinaâ€™s entry into the World Trade Organisation in 2001, and despite its further market reforms and booming private sector, China has retained state capitalism and even reinforced its coercive regime in the era of globalisation, thus developing into the worldâ€™s second-largest economy. The nationâ€™s strategic transition and the growing resentment in US China-policy circles underpin the consensus on Trumpâ€™s policy: that China is succeeding at Americaâ€™s expense.The rationale for Trumpâ€™s challenge to the Chinese model and push for Chinese integration into the rule-based free-market economic system is similar to his predecessor Barack Obamaâ€™s. The difference is in the approach. Whereas Obama adopted the elaborately structured and face-saving approach of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Trump used a crude, downright old-fashioned weapon: tariffs.But Trumpâ€™s dogged attack has hit a nerve in China. Under the growing external pressure and the internal economic downturn exacerbated by the trade war, the Chinese leadership and elite are reviewing whether they have underestimated Trumpâ€™s determination to overhaul US policy on China. In a popular view in China, existing relationships are based on the belief that close trade and investment relations are the ballast of US-China ties, and until now, never has any US president, from Richard Nixon to Obama, challenged that.How can the trade war end? As the openness to discussion indicates, there is a sufficient overlap between Trumpâ€™s wants and Chinaâ€™s willingness to deepen its economic reform and further open its economy. Although the countriesâ€™ close economic ties have been overshadowed by the trade war, they still constitute the foundation of the US-China relationship. Given this reality, compromise is possible, even if conflict between the US-led free-market system and the Chinese model is inevitable.On Chinaâ€™s part, there are ways it can respond to Americaâ€™s concerns over government subsidies to its industries, such as providing preferential loans instead of direct subsidies. Institutional arrangements, such as a new US-China intellectual property rights pact, could help better protect US intellectual property, as well as key technologies in China. They could also restart their stalled bilateral investment treaty talks and make room for these adjustments.The Chinese model could come across as less threatening to the US-led economic system if the Chinese could reverse their current approach. Beijing could tone down the bragging about its overstated economic and technological capability.Instead of focusing on state economic growth, China should shift its attention to improving income, welfare and education investment for its huge working-class and migrant labour population. It could also upgrade poor infrastructure â€“ medical care, education, internet, heating, hygiene, water â€“ in underdeveloped villages and towns.Redirecting the focus of the Chinese model would show the world that China is still a developing country.Source: South China Morning Post",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The conflict between China and the United States is a competition between two different civilisations and value systems.While the trade imbalance between the two countries continues to make headlines, it actually means little to either. For China, the role of net export contribution to economic growth has been negative in most years since 2008. For the US, a trade deficit is inevitable when it consumes 30 per cent of the worldâ€™s products but produces only 13 per cent. Both Washington and Beijing must know this: the dispute is about much more than trade.Washington has been reflecting on its China policy, as US vice-president Mike Pence said in his speech at the Hudson Institute on October 4 â€“ the US opened the door to let China join the World Trade Organisation in 2001 and helped it to thrive through trade. However, China has refused to follow the path that Washington once hoped it would.Also in 2001, the September 11 terrorist attack happened. An event that shocked America and the world, and led to then US president George Bushâ€™s administration changing its foreign policy priorities and policy stance on China. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leadersâ€™ summit in Shanghai that year, Beijing fully endorsed Washingtonâ€™s anti-terrorism policy.Had September 11 not happened, Bush would have had more time and resources to put pressure on China to â€œevolveâ€? in the desired direction. But Beijing at that time was viewed by Washington as a friend, not a foe.Then came the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008, which hurt not only the US economy but also undermined confidence in the whole liberal democracy/free-trade system, or the values known as Washington Consensus.China, meanwhile, was showing the way, with a massive stimulus package. State intervention became a popular coping mechanism around the world, and the Chinese model â€“ defined by a powerful state, a major presence for state-owned enterprises, and illiberal social and political tendencies, suddenly looked attractive â€“ creating the so-called Beijing Consensus.But the real picture in China was much less rosy. The government stimulus enriched state-owned enterprises and local governments at the cost of the private sector, distorting the countryâ€™s economic structure and sowing the seeds for trouble down the road.Chinaâ€™s process of pro-market and liberal changes, started by former leader Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s, stagnated and in some cases went backwards. Interest groups within China, which grew fat under the state-led model, resisted economic liberalisation and political reforms, and this also translated into a more assertive Chinese foreign policy.Reviewing history, we can see that the US is OK with Chinaâ€™s economic rise but not so its model, which lacks private property protection or democratic election. The US is now seeing the danger of letting that model prevail and is staging a cold war to defend its core values.The US relies on values to distinguish enemies from allies and forms alliances based on those values. This explains why US has reached trade deals with South Korea and the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), and is in talks with European Union and Japan.It is quite clear that the US is trying to form a unified trade front with its liberal democratic allies to go against China. If anyone has any doubt, they can read Article 32.10 in the USMCA that allows Washington to nearly veto any free-trade deals of its partners with any â€œnon-marketâ€? country.It is true that China is the worldâ€™s largest trader in goods and biggest trade partner for more than 120 countries, making it very hard for allies of the US to stop trading with China. But Washingtonâ€™s determination to engage in â€œcompetitionâ€? with China could lead to a fundamental change.For Americaâ€™s allies and other countries, the US is still more important to them economically and politically than China. The USâ€™ imports from the EU, Japan and Canada combined are more than twice its imports from China. Foreign investment in the US is four times that of China. If one day they have to chose one side or the other, many will choose Washington over Beijing.For now, the rivalry between the worldâ€™s two largest economies is not a cold war, dividing the world into two camps. But there is a danger that that will happen.A military clash in the South China Sea could spark such a division. If the US determined to contain and isolate China at any price, it may provoke a battle at sea.Beijing, meanwhile, must realise that a free market and liberal values are Americaâ€™s core interests and it will go to war to defend them â€“ as it did in Korea and Vietnam.So, if Beijing believes it is not yet time to have an all-out clash with the US, it should be more restrained in challenging its values and remain cool-headed on the South China Sea issue, especially when facing provocations from US ships.Source: SCMP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US ports are on the front line of Trumpâ€™s trade war â€“ and theyâ€™re bracing for higher China tariffsU.S. ports, which handle hundreds of billions of dollars in merchandise each year, will be the first to feel the pain if the Trump administrationâ€™s trade war begins to slow the global economy.So, as the White House threatens to impose higher duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, port managers are bracing for the prospect of canceled shipments and lost jobs.â€œIt would be a game-changer,â€? said Mario Cordero, executive director of the Port of Long Beach, California. â€œIt would be detrimental to jobs at the port and detrimental to the state and national economy.â€?As the nationâ€™s busiest gateway for Chinese imports, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are on the front lines of the trade war with Beijing. Last year, Southern California ports handled $173 billion in Chinese imports, about a third of all goods shipped from China to the U.S.Still, any widening of tariffs on Chinese goods would be felt by many of the 328 official ports of entry maintained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection where more than $505 billion in goods arrived from China last year. In addition, $130 billion in American made goods and commodities flowed through those ports to China every year, producing a trade deficit in goods of $375 billion.Most economists agree that the Trump administration is misreading the impact of a trade imbalance, which they say produces no economic harm to the U.S. But the trade deficit with China has become a flashpoint for President Donald Trump and his supporters, who rallied behind the president in June when his administration unilaterally increased tariffs on some $34 billion in Chinese imports.China immediately retaliated with its own tariffs on $34 billion in U.S. imports. The Trump administration countered that it is preparing possible tariffs on $200 billion more in Chinese goods. Last week, with no talks apparently underway between Washington and Beijing, the president said he was willing to slap tariffs on every Chinese-made product shipped to the U.S.â€œIâ€™m ready to go to 500,â€? the Trump told CNBC, meaning $500 billion.The immediate impact of such an action would be felt on port operators, shipping companies and the people who work for them. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, for example, estimate they support nearly a million jobs throughout Southern California. Last year, trade with China accounted for $145 billion in imports and exports, over half of the LA portsâ€™ total of $284 billion.So any slowdown in China trade flow could bring layoffs, Cordero said. It would also cut into the roughly $320 billion in local and state tax revenues generated every year by trade flows in ports across the country, he said.For now, trade volumes with China appear to be holding up. In fact, in the short term thereâ€™s been a surge in commodity shipments as producers try to get ahead of possible tariff increases, according to Kurt Nagle, president of the American Association of Port Authorities.Trade volume with China typically picks up at this time of year as the shipping industry enters its peak season, starting with the surge of retail events that begin next month with back-to-school sales promotions and running to the December holiday shopping season. Some retailers and suppliers are reportedly considering moving up orders to get ahead of any future tariff increases.So far, the holiday season is shaping up to be a strong one for retailers, thanks to rising consumer confidence and incomes and lower tax rates, according to James Bohnaker, an analyst at IHS Markit. Heâ€™s forecasting a sales gain of 4.9 percent from last year, along with the strongest back-to-school season since 2014.That could change if consumers are hit with higher prices on a longer list of Chinese imported goods targeted with higher tariffs. Any slowdown in consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. gross domestic product, would quickly ripple through the wider economy.While initial economic impact from tariffs so far has been muted, that could change quickly if Trump follows through on this threat to widen Chinese tariffs, according Greg Daco, an economist at Oxford Economics.700,000 jobs at riskHe estimates that if the U.S. imposes 10 percent tariffs on an another $400 billion of imports from China, and China were to retaliate with 25 percent tariffs on all American imports, the U.S. economy would lose roughly seven-tenths of growth in GDP. Global growth would be cut by half a percentage point. By 2020, the cumulative GDP loss would reach 1 percent in the United States, eliminating 700,000 American jobs and a multiple of that in China, Daco said in a recent research note.â€œThe current economic strength in the U.S. could be no more than a mirage, and rising trade tensions could occur precisely at a time when global momentum is slowing,â€? he said.That prospect, and the uncertainty over Trumpâ€™s next move, may already be having a chilling effect on businesses involved in trade with China.Starting with the people who run the nationâ€™s ports.â€œOur members plan to invest $155 billion in the next five years in infrastructure so ports can better accommodate trade interests,â€? Nagle said. â€œBut now weâ€™re concerned about making such an investment in an unstable trade environment. There is lots of uncertainty.â€?That uncertainty is likely to linger. Trump called an apparent cease-fire in his administrationâ€™s trade war with the European Union this week, after both sides softened their stance and agreed to work to lower tariffs. But some analysts expressed skepticism that an agreement with China may soon follow.â€œEven though it worked for the EU, China has already tried the same softer tactics and been rebuffed,â€? said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics. â€œIt isnâ€™t likely to make the same mistake twice.Source: CNBC",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US president Donald Trump has said he believes Russian president Vladimir Putin is â€œprobablyâ€? involved in â€œassassinationsâ€? and â€œpoisoningsâ€? but sought to downplay his assessment, his harshest yet of his Russian counterpart, saying the killings were â€œnot in our countryâ€?.Trumpâ€™s remarks came in an interview with CBS Newsâ€™s 60 Minutes programme in which he also said China meddles in US elections, that the trade war with China was actually a â€œskirmishâ€? and that he doesnâ€™t think climate change is a hoax, but remains doubtful of who or what caused it.â€œProbably he is, yeah. Probably. I mean, I donâ€™t â€¦,â€? Trump said in response to a question if he agreed â€œthat Vladimir Putin is involved in assassinations? In poisoningsâ€?.â€œBut I rely on them, itâ€™s not in our country,â€? he added.The United States joined its western allies last August to slap sanctions against Russia for allegedly poisoning a former spy Sergei Skirpal and his daughter in Britain. Russia has denied it, as it has all previous instances and allegations of murders and assassinations of those critical of the government.Trump has rarely ever had harsh things to say about Putin and took a lot of criticism for his performance at a joint conference in Helsinki during which the American president had seemed to have granted equal weightage to US intelligenceâ€™s assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and to the Russian presidentâ€™s denial of it.Asked if Russia interfered in the 2016 elections, which is being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Trump said: â€œThey-- they meddled. But I think China meddled too.â€? Trump tends to view any suggestion of Russian interference as casting doubt on his election, questioning the legitimacy of his presidency. He has thus been reluctant to get behind the combined assessment of the US intelligence.Trump has begun accusing China of meddling in US elections only recently and in connection with Beijingâ€™s selective targeting of his voter-base for retaliatory measures against tariffs imposed by Trump on Chinese imports. After alluding to it in recent remarks, the president launched a full and frontal attack on China at a UN security council meet he chaired recently, eliciting a quick and sharp rejoinder.â€œI think China meddled also,â€? Trump insisted in the interview. â€œAnd I think, frankly, China is a bigger problem.â€?Trumpâ€™s views on China have shifted markedly from the accommodation and warmth he had shown in the early months of his presidency. He has since slapped tariff on $250 billion worth of imports from China accusing it of employing unfair trade practices, theft of intellectual property rights and denying market access, and slapped sanctions on it for buying Russian defence equipment.The US president said he wants a trade deal with China but doesnâ€™t think Beijing is ready for it yet. And he disputed the interviewerâ€™s characterization of the escalating trade tensions as war. â€œI (have) called it a battle. But, actually, Iâ€™m gonna lower that. I consider it a skirmish.â€?He also revisited the issue of climate change in the interview in view of the super storms that have hit the United States in recent months â€” Michael in Florida and Georgia past week, coming on the heels of Florence in the Carolinas, Maria in Puerto Rico, and Harvey in Texas.â€œI think somethingâ€™s happening,â€? he said in reply to a question about his well-known views on the subject â€” that itâ€™s a hoax. â€œSomethingâ€™s changing and itâ€™ll change back again. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a hoax, I think thereâ€™s probably a difference. But I donâ€™t know that itâ€™s man-made.â€?First Published: Oct 15, 2018 21:55 IST",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"China could ratchet up its trade war tactics against the United States as President Donald Trump has escalated the trade war between the two nations this week. Politico points out that China knows how to fight a trade war and could go beyond retaliatory tariffs next. China has been known to successfully encourage its 1.4 billion population to give up products from targeted countries, such as Big Macs, and make business harder for U.S. companies in China. While China has far fewer U.S. imports to impose tariffs on, a trade expert told Politico: â€œThe reality is the Chinese can do quite a bit to hurt U.S. companies in the Chinese market.â€?Tariffs that have yet to take effect will target U.S. agricultural products. Earlier this week, business and agriculture groups penned a letter to Congress seeking lawmakers involvement to reign in Trumpâ€™s trade agenda. The group asked for congressional oversight, while detailing how Congress has the power to regulate foreign trade.North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp says if President Trump follows through with tariffs that Chinaâ€™s retaliation would be â€œboth strong in quantity and gravity.â€? Heitkamp says Trump is â€œplaying chickenâ€? with China by â€œcreating a trade war at farmersâ€™ expense.â€? Heitkamp continued: â€œFrom soybeans to farm equipment to oil, these tariffs threaten to strike at the heart of our job-sustaining industries.â€?The North Dakota Democrat says U.S. farmers need trade policy that opens markets, not closes them. Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa agreed in a separate statement, saying â€œfarming need trade, not aid,â€? in referring to any programs that would be made available to assist farmers through a trade war.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"â€œTariffs are the greatest!â€? President Donald Trump tweeted on Tuesday.Tariffs are not the greatest. They are effectively taxes on consumers, which often elicit retaliatory action from a countryâ€™s trading partners.Everyone knows that â€” including the president. It hasnâ€™t prevented him from launching a trade war, of course. Trump has consistently maintained that such wars are good and easy to win. But he acknowledged, even before he launched his, that they leave some casualties.â€œIâ€™m not saying there wonâ€™t be a little pain,â€? Trump said in April, after his initial skirmish with China.Still, he argued, the roaring U.S. economy meant that we could afford to take the hit and that we will â€œhave a much stronger country when we are finished.â€?â€œWeâ€™re playing with the bankâ€™s money,â€? Trump added last week, pointing to the fact that the stock market is up some 30 percent since Election Day 2016.Still, the administration announced Tuesday that it would provide up to $12 billion in emergency aid to farmers who have been adversely affected by trade war due to retaliatory tariffs that will throttle their access to export markets.Most of those producers live in areas that went for Trump in 2016. Chinaâ€™s tariffs, in particular, seem to target swing states. Republicans canâ€™t afford to ignore that with the midterm elections less than four months away.And the funds will be a Band-Aid, at best. Thereâ€™s no guarantee that the trade war will be resolved quickly. Our trading partners may develop new partnerships in the meantime; some of them are doing that anyway.What I find ominous, though, is that Trumpâ€™s emergency aid isnâ€™t actually a bailout. The American farmers who voted for Trump could have anticipated the risk that Trump would launch a trade war, of course. And they should have taken that risk seriously.But farmers didnâ€™t impose tariffs on themselves, and the emergency aid wonâ€™t change their situation; itâ€™ll just offset the direct losses theyâ€™re expecting come harvest season.And the Trump administrationâ€™s plan to extend emergency aid to them was several months in the making. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue began working on it because the â€œemergencyâ€? at hand was anticipated. It wasnâ€™t hard to anticipate, either. In the event of a trade war, agriculture is a predictable target of retaliatory tariffs. The industryâ€™s exports are commodities.So Trump has, in a sense, effectively nationalized American agriculture. The situation farmers are facing is one that the White House created knowingly, if not deliberately, in the service of Trumpâ€™s campaign against what he calls â€œFool Trade.â€?Thatâ€™s amusing, in a way, because Trump is a Republican and Republicans have traditionally supported free markets. In fairness, though, the federal government already subsidizes many farmers directly as a matter of course. Thatâ€™s preferable to supporting them indirectly via market-distorting mechanisms like the ethanol mandate, if you ask me â€” and itâ€™s something the federal government should be prepared to do in the event of emergencies, at least, because disruptions to agricultural production can leave all of us hungry.But in this case, Trump is just using the Commodity Credit Corporation to placate soybean farmers after using them as pawns in his pursuit of a broader agenda. And whatâ€™s notable is that his reasoning on the subject could be applied to literally any industry affected by his trade war, which is ongoing. If American farmers deserve our support, so do American factory workers, presumably. And we all know Trump has vowed to be a champion for American coal miners.So Texans should be worried about the presidentâ€™s trade war if they werenâ€™t already. Texasâ€™ economy is still growing, as it stands. Unemployment is at 4 percent, a near-record low. And Texas farmers havenâ€™t yet been directly targeted by retaliatory tariffs, interestingly. But the state leads the nation in exports. At some point, the trade war will hit home.And weâ€™ll have to be stoical when it does. I actually think one could make a case for nationalizing the agriculture industry to stabilize rural Americaâ€™s economic base and guarantee food security. But Trumpâ€™s case for the emergency aid he announced Tuesday is simply that the private sector should serve his agenda â€” and that the federal government should intervene if it doesnâ€™t.Trump has been making a similar case with regard to the energy industry, for example. In June, he ordered the Department of Energy to take action preventing coal and nuclear plants from closing, citing concerns about the gridâ€™s reliability. And the president hasnâ€™t yet expressed much concern over how his tariffs on steel and aluminum might affect the oil and gas industry, even though Gov. Greg Abbott sent him a letter last month raising the issue.Concerns about the differential impact of his policies may be inherently parochial from Trumpâ€™s perspective â€” unless they come from a swing state. He says his goal is to make America great again. Heâ€™s stipulated that weâ€™ll be a stronger country as a result of his trade war. It stands to reason we should all do our part, but in the event of a trade war, Texas will have to do more than most.erica.grieder@chron.comtwitter.com/ericagrieder",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trump on Wednesday sought to allay rising anxiety among farmers about the impact of his trade war with China, promising over Twitter to bolster sales of their products but acknowledging it could take a while.'I will open things up, better than ever before, but it can't go too quickly,' Trump said in a pair of tweets sent from Brussels, where he is attending a gathering of NATO leaders. 'I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers, and will win!'His attempt at reassurance came a day after he escalated his trade war with China, identifying an added $200 billion in Chinese products that he intends to hit with import tariffs. The move made good on the president's threat to respond to China's retaliation for the initial U.S. tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods, which went into effect on Friday.The fallout has been acutely felt by soybean producers and other agricultural sectors in the Midwest - prompting even some members of Trump's own party to voice alarm.'I'm very, very nervous about it, and my constituents are very, very nervous about it,' Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said in an interview on Fox News on Wednesday morning shortly before Trump sent his tweets from overseas.Grassley said the Trump administration tariff fight has 'a very detrimental effect on current markets' and that the impact is rippling through other industries in his state beyond agriculture.'I hope he knows what he's doing,' Grassley said of Trump. 'It's making people nervous.'Trump's comments on Twitter came on a day that Vice President Mike Pence was scheduled to spend in three Midwestern states.At an event in Kansas City, Pence read Trump's tweets and reiterated that the administration is fighting for farmers 'in the heartland.''Our president is going to keep fighting for trade deals that are free and fair and reciprocal,' Pence said. 'We will always fight for American farmers to export what we grow and raise around the planet.'Pence cited several exporting opportunities that he said have improved during the Trump administration, including beef to China and poultry to South Korea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US President Donald Trump on Thursday slapped deeply contentious trade tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, swatting aside warnings of a global trade war and protests from allies in Europe and at home.The tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum will come into effect in 15 days, the White House said.They will not apply to Canada and Mexico initially, an official said, adding that security and trade partners could negotiate to seek exemption.The measures are likely to spark retaliatory sanctions from the European Union, China and other economic powers.Moving to fulfill a protectionist campaign promise, Trump leaned on a little-used national security clause in US trade law.'This is a promise made, a promise kept,' a senior administration official said, 'no one should be surprised.'The metals are used in everything from cars to construction, roads to railways. Economists estimate billions of dollars of trade will be affected.Hours before the signing, Trump told his cabinet that these products were the 'backbone of our nation, they are the bedrock of defense industrial base.'The mercurial 45th president compared his action to those of predecessors George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and William McKinley.'Our greatest presidents' he said, 'they protected our country from outside influence, from other countries coming in and stealing our wealth and stealing our jobs and stealing our companies.'More than 50 percent of steel and aluminum exports come from allies in the European Union, Canada, Japan, and South Korea. But countries from Brazil to South Africa are likely to be affected.Trump said he would be flexible toward 'real friends,' touting an exemption for Canada and Mexico as they renegotiate a trade deal with Washington.If an agreement on NAFTA is reached, he said, 'it is most likely that we won't be charging those two countries the tariffs.'Trump added Australia to a list of likely carve-outs, and indicated that other trade and military allies could be exempted.'We have a very close relationship with Australia,' he said. 'We have a trade surplus with Australia, great country, long term partner, we'll be doing something with them.'But he singled out Germany for criticism, reviving a longstanding gripe that European NATO allies do not pay their fair share.'We have some friends and some enemies where we have been tremendously taken advantage of over the years on trade and on military,' he said.'If you look at NATO, where Germany pays one percent and we are paying 4.2 percent of a much bigger GDP -- that's not fair.'Partners promise backlashLast week Trump stunned the world -- and his own aides -- with an off-the-cuff announcement of his tariff plan, before White House lawyers judged the legality of the move and before it was clear which countries would be targeted.He cited Chinese overproduction and national security concerns as the main driver.Since then, the White House has scrambled to catch up, Trump's top economic advisor Gary Cohn -- who opposed the move -- quit in protest and stock markets have sunk.'He may be globalist, but I still like him,' Trump joked on Thursday, alluding to an ideological clash within his administration that the 'nationalists' appear to have decisively won.As Trump approved the tariffs, 11 partners in the Asia-Pacific were in Santiago, Chile, to sign a multilateral trade deal embraced by president Barack Obama but rejected by Trump.While economic fallout from Trump's tariffs remains unclear, the political fallout has been swift.More than 100 Republican lawmakers have signed a letter to Trump expressing 'deep concern' about the policy, which they warned could 'undermine' economic gains from the president's own tax reforms.The European Union, China and Brazil have all warned they will retaliate, with the decision threatening to sour already vinegared trans-Atlantic relations.The European Union has promised tariffs on items from steel to peanut butter, bourbon and denim -- most of which are produced in states that Trump needs to win reelection.'Trade wars are bad and easy to lose,' EU President Donald Tusk warned, rejecting Trump's assertion they were 'good and easy to win'.Data released Wednesday showed the US foreign trade deficit widened in January to its highest level in nine years -- heaping pressure on Trump, who had campaigned on a promise to reverse that trend.Trump blamed the situation on his White House predecessors, while also taking aim at Beijing over the size of its trade deficit with the United States.China meanwhile warned Thursday it was ready to respond to US tariffs if they materialize.'Choosing a trade war is surely the wrong prescription, in the end you will only hurt others and yourself,' Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, adding that 'China will certainly make an appropriate and necessary response.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by Media TeamApr 11 2018According to business information analysts IBISWorld, Australia stands to be caught in the middle of a trade war between the United States and China, as the worldâ€™s two largest economies launch increasingly retaliatory tariffs at each other. While some local industries may become more exposed to risk as a result, IBISWorld believes Australia will also have the rare opportunity to seize export market share in both markets.â€œAustralia is one of the best-placed countries in the world to reap the gains of a trade war, due to our natural advantage of having ease of access to maritime trading with both major economies,â€? said Mr Jason Aravanis, Senior Analyst at IBISWorld. â€œIn addition, Australia has beneficial bilateral free trade agreements with both China and the US, which provide more stability to international trade.â€œWhile the trade war presents opportunities for some sectors, others will likely be at greater risk, as Australia is being caught between its largest trade partner and its largest investor; between the economy we rely on and the nation we look to for our security.â€?Why USA and China matter to AustraliaAccording to IBISWorld, the United States and China are both vital trading partners for Australia, but for different reasons. China is Australiaâ€™s largest two-way trading partner, accounting for 17.7% of all imports into Australia and 29.6% of Australian exports in 2016-17. As such, the Australian economy is intrinsically tied to the performance of the Chinese economy. Many industries rely on Chinese demand for exports, or Chinese supply of imported production inputs.The United States is Australiaâ€™s third largest trading partner, after Japan. However, the United States is the largest foreign investor in Australia, with over $860 billion invested in 2016. In contrast, China is only the seventh largest investor in Australia.Australian winnersAs China and the United States increasingly lock each other out of their domestic markets, certain Australian industries have the ability to seize market share.â€œThe Australian agricultural sector is likely to be one of the largest winners, as China has enacted tariffs on popular US food products,â€? said Mr Aravanis.In 2017-18, China is expected to account for 25.1% of export demand in the Australian Wine Production industry, and this is forecast to grow in response to a 15% tariff imposed on US wines this month. Similarly, a 25% Chinese tariff on US soybeans will create massive opportunities for the Australian Grain Growing industry, particularly as China consumes about two-thirds of global soybean production each year. Rising demand for premium meats in Chinese households has led to strong growth in Australiaâ€™s Meat Processing industry, and this industryâ€™s performance is expected to further improve as a 25% tariff is imposed on US meats. Other Australian agricultural industries are also likely to benefit, including fruit and seed industries.According to IBISWorld, some Australian industries also have the opportunity to gain market share in the United States, however Australian exports are likely to encounter greater competition from other countries in this market, such as Canada, Brazil, and the European Union.â€œAs the United States has imposed a 25% tariff on steel and 10% tariff on aluminium from China, the Australian Black Coal Mining and Aluminium Smelting industries may experience greater demand from US clients. In addition, US tariffs on Chinese chemicals, medicinal products, and electronic components are likely to create opportunities for Australian firms,â€? said Mr Aravanis.Australian losersDespite the positive gains for some Australian industries, others are likely to be negatively affected by a trade war.â€œOn a macro-economic scale, a downturn in either Chinese or US GDP growth is highly likely to undermine the growth of Australiaâ€™s GDP. This could lead to an increase in unemployment, as well as a sustained hit to business confidence as the stability of trade liberalisation in undermined,â€? said Mr Aravanis.â€œSome industries are highly exposed to the risk of a trade war. Major mining industries such as the Iron Ore Mining industry could be affected by a slowdown in Chinese economic growth, which would lead to far lower export prices and total demand. Tourism in Australia would also likely be negatively affected, as a hit to consumer confidence in both China and the United States would encourage consumers to postpone luxury expenses such as international holidays.â€?Despite these challenges, IBISWorld believes the overall Australian economy is well placed should a trade war eventuate, at least relative to the conditions of other global economies. However, a trade war would likely lead to an overall decline in economic prosperity for Australia.Tariffs imposed by China and the United States against each other:Chinese tariffsItem Tariff Pork 25% Soybeans and grains 25% Wine 15% Fruit 15%US tariffsItem Tariff Steel 25% Medical supplies 25% Aerospace equipment 25% Whitegoods 25% Aluminium 10%Industries mentioned in this release:Wine Production in AustraliaGrain Growing in AustraliaMeat Processing in AustraliaBlack Coal Mining in AustraliaAluminium Smelting in AustraliaIron Ore Mining in AustraliaTourism in Australia-ends-For more information, to obtain industry reports, or to speak with an analyst, please contact:Georgia Cook/Anna CaswellIBISWorld Media Relations Representatives â€“ Anne Wild & Associates Pty LtdTel: +61 2 9440 0414Mobile: 0422 289 916Email: gcook@awassociates.com.au / acaswell@awassociates.com.au",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A trade war between the US and China officially began on Friday as President Donald Trump's administration imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese products. Beijing has vowed to 'fight back'.The penalties went into effect at 12:01 a.m., reports The New York Times.Minutes after the tariffs went into effect, a spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement: 'China promised not to fire the first shot, but in order to safeguard the country's core interests as well as that of the people, it is forced to fight back.' The statement did not, however, provide details on its retaliation.The administration's 25 percent tariffs are targeting Chinese products such as industrial machinery, medical devices, and auto parts.On Thursday, Trump showed no signs of backing down from his fight and suggested the possibility of tariffs on almost $500 billion more of Chinese goods.'Thirty-four, and then you have another 16 in two weeks and then, as you know, we have 200 billion in abeyance and then after the 200 billion, we have 300 billion in abeyance. OK?' Trump told reporters aboard the Air Force One.Following Friday's development, the Shanghai Composite index fell 1.1 percent, after reaching more than a two-year low this week, reports the Guardian. Chinese manufacturers have already been hit by a strengthening yuan that has made exports more expensive.Trump and his advisers argue the tariffs are necessary to pressure China into abandoning unfair practices such as stealing intellectual property and forcing American companies to hand over valuable technology, reports CNN.In addition to the tariffs, the White House is placing restrictions on investment and on visas for Chinese nationals.The clash with China comes as the Trump administration is also fighting over trade with American allies such as Canada and the European Union.American tariffs on steel and aluminium imports have provoked retaliatory measures against billions of dollars of American exports.[Source- IANS]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"China has said it is â€œfully preparedâ€? for a trade war with the US, with little sign of an end to mounting tensions between the worldâ€™s two biggest economies.Hopes are dwindling that Washington and Beijing will find an amicable solution before Friday, when the US is due to start charging tariffs on $34bn (Â£26bn) of Chinese goods, with Beijing declaring they will retaliate in kind. The ramifications will likely be felt far beyond the borders of the two nations.Tensions have been simmering for weeks, amid a flurry of smaller tit-for-tat measures. The latest of which involved a US Department of Commerce agency recommending that Chinaâ€™s largest telecoms carrier, China Mobile, should not be given operating licenses for America. The report cited national security concerns posed by the state-run firm.China foreign minister spokesman Lu Kang said the latest move was based on â€œunfounded speculation and an irrational clampdownâ€? stemming from a cold war mentality.â€œWe hope the US will provide a level-playing field for Chinese companiesâ€™ investment and operation in the US and do something conducive to the mutual trust,â€? he said.Mr Lu said that Beijing is â€œfully prepared to take a package of necessary measuresâ€? to safeguard its national interests, having accused Washington of protectionism.Starting on Friday, Washington will add up to a 25 per cent tariff on 818 Chinese products, with the potential for another 284 items to be added. China has pledged that in return it will do the same to 545 American products.Amid the heated diplomatic exchanges, Chinaâ€™s government recently issued a warning to Chinese citizens travelling to the US. The warning noted the high cost of medical treatment in the US, the importance of guarding against crime and terrorist attacks and the considerable powers wielded by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.Answering questions about the move and its timing, Mr Lu said the government was merely fulfilling its duty to warn travellers of â€œpotential dangersâ€?.Donald Trump has accused China of unfair trade practices, but if Beijing does retaliate any measures would likely hurt members of the presidentâ€™s political base.Shape Created with Sketch.

"The European Union has slapped tariffs on some $3.2bn(Â£2.4bn) worth of US goods, in retaliation for tariffs the Trump administration imposed on imported steel and aluminium earlier this month.The EU announced a 25 per cent tariff on American products such as whiskey, tobacco, Harley Davidson motorcycles and peanut butter on Friday. They leveraged another 50 per cent tax on select items such as footwear, some types of clothing, and washing machines, according to the BBC.The tariffs come weeks after the Trump administration implemented a 25 per cent tariff on steel and 10 per cent tariff on aluminium, affecting trade partners like Canada, Mexico, and the EU. Donald Trump threatened additional taxes on European cars if the EU chose to retaliate.Speaking to the Irish Parliament on Thursday, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU would â€œdo what we have to do to rebalance and safeguardâ€? against the US tariffs.â€œIt goes against all logic and history,â€? he said of the US taxes. â€œOur response must be clear but measured.'The statement echoed the words of EU trade commissioner Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m, who said on Wednesday that the EU was â€œleft with no other choiceâ€? than to impose retaliatory measures.The EUâ€™s tariffs target products primarily made in Republican states, hoping to threaten Mr Trump's party in the run-up to the November midterm elections. They come after a tense showdown at the G7 summit, where Mr Trump refused to sign on to a joint communique with leaders of the world's most advanced economies.The EU has filed a case with the World Trade Organisation (WTO), claiming the Trump administrationâ€™s tariffs were â€œpure protectionistâ€? and â€œillegalâ€?. They also threatened a second round of tariffs on some $4.3bn worth of US products if the dispute was not resolved.Mexico has already announced its own tariffs on US goods, and Canadaâ€™s tariffs on nearly $13bn of US products are set to take effect next month.Shape Created with Sketch.

"Donald Trump is exploring the possibility of the US joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, more than a year after signing an executive order withdrawing America from the proposed trade pact.The president said the US would 'only join TPP if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to President Obama'.'We already have BILATERAL deals with six of the eleven nations in TPP, and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those nations, Japan, who has hit us hard on trade for years!' he wrote on Twitter.It comes amid mounting pressure from Republicans in farming states anxious his protectionist trade policies could spiral into a trade war with China that would hit rural America.The billionaire spent the 2016 presidential campaign ripping into the multi-national pact, saying he could get a better deal for US businesses by negotiating one-on-one with countries in the Pacific Rim.But he hinted at the possibility of joining the trade deal in January, when he told the World Economic Forum in Davos he would 'do TPP if we made a much better deal than we had'.'Last year, the president kept his promise to end the TPP deal negotiated by the Obama Administration because it was unfair to American workers and farmers,' the White House said in a statement.The president assigned his top trade advisers, US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and his new chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, 'to take another look at whether or not a better deal could be negotiated'.Mr Trump first disclosed his request on Thursday to a group of lawmakers at a White House meeting on trade. Members of Congress have been pressing Mr Trump to shift course after escalating trade threats, including China's plan to slap tariffs on soybeans and other US crops.The apparent decision comes after the 11 other TPP countries went ahead last month and signed the pact in Santiago, Chile. The agreement is meant to establish freer trade in the Asia-Pacific region and put pressure on China to open its markets to compete with and perhaps eventually join the bloc.It was not immediately clear how committed Mr Trump was to embark on a new path of potentially thorny negotiations. Mr Trump frequently equivocates on policy when faced with opposition, only to reverse course later.'I'm sure there are lots of particulars that they'd want to negotiate, but the president multiple times reaffirmed in general to all of us and looked right at Larry Kudlow and said, 'Larry, go get it done,'' said Ben Sasse, a Republican senator Nebraska.The president has mused publicly about rejoining the deal before, suggesting he would re-enter if he could negotiate more favourable terms. He has not said precisely what provisions he would want changed.It's unclear how willing the other 11 countries would be to reopen the agreement and make concessions to lure the US back, though its economic power would likely be an appeal.'If the Trump administration doesn't pose too many demands, it is likely that the other TPP members will see the value of the bringing the US back into the fold,' said Eswar Prasad, Cornell University professor of trade policy. 'Undoubtedly, a TPP that includes the US would be stronger and more formidable than one that does not.'Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been renewing their pitches for TPP - rather than Mr Trump's threats of steep tariffs on steel and other products - as a way to counter China on trade. Ron Johnson was among a handful of senators who recently visited China to meet with government and business leaders there. He said it is time to work with a coalition of trading partners to increase pressure on China.Shape Created with Sketch.

Photographer Joshua Roberts: 'I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.'

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: 'Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump's second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer's office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn't even think about it twice. 'We'll do it!' he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.'

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: 'We're often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone.'

During one of the trips to the so called 'Winter White House', Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies.

Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world's eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump's hand.

All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.'

Jonathan Ernst: 'The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It's crucial to know who's who and why they're important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it's like to be a West Wing staffer on the road.'

Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: â€œThe image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today's politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.'

In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full.

If I'm not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump's recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven't seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn't work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.'

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: 'Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake.

Photographer Joshua Roberts: 'I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in.

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: 'Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump's second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer's office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn't even think about it twice. 'We'll do it!' he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.'

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: 'We're often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone.'

All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.'

Jonathan Ernst: 'The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It's crucial to know who's who and why they're important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack.

I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven't seen but other photographers did.

Reuters/Jonathan Ernst'I have to believe President Xi is smiling all the way to regional domination as a result of our pulling out of TPP. I don't think we can get back into the TPP soon enough,' Mr Johnson said when talking to reporters about the trip.Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, which was highly critical of US involvement in a pact it viewed as lowering labour and environmental standards, said Mr Trump's reversal on the issue would signal that the president 'cannot be trusted on anything,' said Lori Wallach, the group's director.The US International Trade Commission, an independent federal agency, has projected in 2016 that TPP would increase economic growth and create jobs, but the gains would be small: After 15 years, the deal would add just 128,000 jobs, an increase of less than a tenth of 1 percent. Exports would increase, but imports would increase more. Agriculture and the business services industry would see gains, but manufacturing output and employment would decrease slightly under TPP.In the meeting with farm state lawmakers, Mr Trump also suggested the possibility of directing the Environmental Protection Agency to allow year-round sales of renewable fuel with blends of 15 per cent ethanol.The EPA currently bans the 15 per cent blend, called E15, during the summer because of concerns that it contributes to smog on hot days. Gasoline typically contains 10 per cent ethanol. Farm state lawmakers have pushed for greater sales of the higher ethanol blend to boost demand for the corn-based fuel.North Dakota governor Doug Burgum said Mr Trump made some 'pretty positive statements' about allowing the year-round use of E-15 ethanol, which could help corn growers.The White House meetings came as an array of business executives and trade groups expressed concerns at a congressional hearing about the impact that tariffs will have on their business. Still, there were some supporters, too.'Withdrawing the threat of tariffs without achieving results would be tantamount to waiving the white flag of trade surrender,' said Scott Paul," president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing.Additional reporting by AP"""
"In President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade war, the states he won during the election are the most defenceless.Thatâ€™s according to economists at Citi, who last week published a research note on which US states are most exposed to a trade war and what this means for the midterm elections.â€œWith several economies now imposing retaliatory trade actions in the wake of the Trump administrationâ€™s trade tariffs, the stakes have risen for, and the evidence more compelling against, â€˜redâ€™ states by several measures,â€? Citiâ€™s Dana Peterson said in the note. Trade wars may reverse the â€œhiring bonanza,â€? she added.The tariffs â€“ taxes on imports to the US â€“ were sold as a way to level the playing field between US producers and their foreign competition, and grow industry even more. But China, the European Union, Canada, India, and Mexico are set to retaliate.On Friday, the US and China imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of each otherâ€™s goods, with Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Commerce saying in a statement that Trump launched â€œthe largest trade war in economic historyâ€?.Red states, so-called because theyâ€™re historically Republican or voted for Trump in 2016, stand to lose more because they benefit the most from trade with other countries, Citiâ€™s Peterson said. Imports and exports to red states totalled $2.1 trillion last year, compared to $1.7 trillion for Democratic blue states. Texas, Michigan, and Illinois were among the largest contributors to trade nationwide, since they have some of the largest ports.After examining the kinds of goods that could be taxed, Citi found that red states ship more to countries that could retaliate US tariffs. These exports include various kinds of food, beverages, luxury goods and medical appliances â€“ all of which are under the purview of tariffs.This chart shows the red states exposed to reciprocal tariffs:Theyâ€™re more than blue states:This analysis was based on data from the Census Bureau, which tell us where these products were shipped from, not where they were made. But even after looking at Bureau of Economic Analysis data that show what each state produces, Citiâ€™s conclusion was that tariffs would hurt red states more than they would help.â€œThe Trump administration hopes that the US tariffs can simultaneously aid negotiations with foreign economies and help US firms,â€? Peterson said. â€œHowever, it appears the benefits of tariffs to US producers will be eroded by reciprocal retaliatory actions that are specifically targeting sectors the administration champions, and Republican strongholds.â€?The state-level data further show that 80 per cent of red-state economies benefit, at a level above the national median, from producing goods targeted by tariffs. Only 10 per cent of blue states are above the median.The retaliatory tariffs could hit where they hurt the most: ordinary votersâ€™ pockets. According to Commerce Department data compiled by Citi, red states accounted for 3.9 million jobs related to goods exports, compared to 2.5 million in blue states.â€œWith few exceptions (Texas, Florida), many â€˜redâ€™ states lack large, coastal international hubs, which might make each additional exports-related job loss associated with reduced global trade that much more detrimental to per capita income growth,â€? Peterson said.And five months to the election, itâ€™s possible that trade wars become a major campaign issue, she added.â€œEvery region of the US is affected by trade dispute intensification, but the data suggest that voters living in states that supported President Trump in 2016 may bear the brunt of the negative repercussions of heightened tensions and the imposition of retaliatory measures,â€? Peterson said.â€˜A fighting chanceâ€™To gauge the impact of the trade wars, the manufacturing sector is a good place to start. Many business owners are worried, but arenâ€™t slowing hiring yet. Contacts that spoke to the regional Federal Reserve banks and responded to surveys, particularly those who rely on steel and aluminium, have flagged higher prices.The outcry is not industry wide, however. Thatâ€™s partly because manufacturers are still on a hiring spree that gained steam after the 2016 elections. The Labour Departmentâ€™s jobs report for June, the fourth month since tariffs were implemented, showed manufacturing jobs increased by 36,000. That was the third-best month in the last five years.â€œItâ€™s time to acknowledge that predictions that the steel tariffs would bring doom and gloom were wildly off-base,â€? Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said in a statement Friday after the jobs report.â€œThe long-term benefits to employment and the US economy from leveling the playing field on trade can be secured,â€? Paul said.â€œBut weâ€™ve got to give this strategy a fighting chance.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russia has struck back against the US decision to impose tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium by imposing its own tariffs on US goods, widening a trade spat China has called the â€œbiggest trade war in economic historyâ€?.The move comes after Beijing and Washington imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of each otherâ€™s goods on Friday, amid a spiralling dispute over technology and trade practices.In Moscow, Maxim Oreshkin, the economic development minister, said that additional tariffs ranging from 25 per cent to 40 per cent have been applied to some road construction equipment, oil and gas equipment, metal processing instruments, drilling equipment and optical fibre.The EU, India, China and Russia all have applied to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to challenge the US tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium, which mostly took effect back in March. Washington argues they have been put in place for national security reasons.China later said it had it has filed a second complaint to the WTO over the US impose more tariffs.Mr Oreshkin said that Russian steel and aluminium makers suffered $537.6m (Â£405m) in damages from the new US tariffs. He noted that the new Russian tariffs will only allow a partial compensation of $87.6m.While President Donald Trump has boasted that trade wars are â€œgoodâ€? and â€œeasy to winâ€?, the global ramifications of such hardline measures has worried financial markets and many of Washingtonâ€™s international partners.Cecilia Malmstrom, the EUâ€™s trade commissioner, said in a tweet that she was worried about the tit-for-tat tariff hikes between the United States and China, and warned about where the escalation was leading.â€œWorrying development with escalation of tariffs between US and China. Clearly damaging for the world economy. Trade wars are bad and not easy to win,â€? she wrote.Washington imposed 25 per cent duties on $34bn on imports from China, the first in a series of possible increases that Mr Trump says could affect up to $550bn of Chinese goods. Mr Trump believes that the measures will protect metal workers that were a core part of his support that guided him to the presidency in 2016.Shape Created with Sketch.

t base, and the new tariff measures will likely cause problems for the Trump administration.The president will be happy to gamble on the reactions of allies and the international community, as keeping to his â€œAmerica Firstâ€? protectionist polices plays well domestically. But critics have suggested the White House has not thought through the long-term impacts of a drawn-out trade war on sections of the US economy.Mr Trump has suggested he will not back down until China yields, having accused Beijing of a number of â€œunfairâ€? trade practices.Mr Trump said on Thursday that higher tariffs on an additional $16bn in Chinese goods were set to take effect in two weeks. After that, the hostilities could intensify: Mr Trump said Washington is ready to target an additional $200bn in Chinese imports â€“ and then $300bn more â€“ if Beijing does not yield.That would bring the total of targeted Chinese goods to $550bn â€“ more than the $506bn in goods that China shipped to the United States last year.Chinese officials reject accusations they steal or force foreign companies to hand over technology. But rules on auto manufacturing and other industries require companies to work through state-owned partners, obliging them to share know-how.The official China Daily newspaper accused the Trump administration of â€œbehaving like a gang of hoodlumsâ€?. It said they would damage the global economy unless other countries stop them.â€œThere should be no doubting Beijingâ€™s resolve,â€? the newspaper said.The American Chamber of Commerce in China appealed to both sides to negotiate.â€œThere are no winners in a trade war,â€? the chamberâ€™s chairman, William Zarit, said in a statement. â€œWe urge the two governments to come back to the negotiation table.â€?For their part, China has also looked towards the EU as it seeks to put pressure on the US.In an opinion piece for a German newspaper, Li Keqiang, Chinaâ€™s premier, has called on Berlin to sweep aside barriers hindering Chinese firmsâ€™ investment in Europe, urging German companies â€œnot to be afraidâ€? of cooperating with their Chinese counterparts.Mr Liâ€™s message, in an article for the Frankfurter Allgemeine, comes ahead of an intergovernmental summit in Berlin next week, when German manufacturersâ€™ concerns about loss of technological leadership to China are likely to be high on the agenda.â€œ[I hope] Germany changes its mind and creates a fair, open environment and a stable institutional framework for companies that invest in Germany or Europe,â€? Mr Li wrote.During an official visit to Bulgaria, as part of his European trip Mr Li said: â€œNo one will win by fighting a trade war," yet China will take countermeasures in the face of unilateral moves.â€?Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this piece""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The threat of a global trade war is new and the atmosphere around trade is unusually fraught, but disputes between the European Union, the US, China and other big economic players have bubbled below the surface for years.The threat of a global trade war is new and the atmosphere around trade is unusually fraught, but disputes between the European Union, the US, China and other big economic players have bubbled below the surface for years.As trade war steps up, WTO already dealing with hundreds of disputesIn total, China and US have more than 300 disputes with different countries and trading blocs, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF).These disputes between nations are handled by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the global organisation that deals with the rules of trade between nations.WTO trade agreements are negotiated and signed by the bulk of the world's trading nations, and then ratified in national parliaments. The main goal of the WTO is to ensure that trade between nations flows as smoothly, predictably, and freely as possible.The US is the main country that China is currently engaging in disputes with, followed by the EU. However, the EU tops the list for engaging in disputes against the US, and in disputes brought by the US, according to the WEF.And with the trade war between the world's two biggest economies, the US and China, showing no sign of abating, disputes between nations look set to continue.Currently China is involved in a total of 57 disputes, either as the complainant or as responder to complaints from other countries.Given the position of China and the US as global economic superpowers, it is unsurprising that the US accounts for the majority of the disputes that China is involved in.However, China also has a number of disputes with the EU, as well as a small amount of disputes with countries such as Mexico and Japan.Meanwhile, the US currently has five times as many trade disputes as China.Several of the complaints against the US have come into play following the order signed by US President Donald Trump in March that imposed a 25pc import tax on steel and a 10pc tariff on foreign-produced aluminium, according to the WEF.Among the countries and trading blocs that have lodged complaints with the WTO against the steel and aluminium tariffs are China, India, the EU, Norway, Russia, Canada and Mexico.Meanwhile, the US has lodged over 100 complaints with the WTO in respect of imports or the trade policies of nine countries as well as the EU.Included in the products that the US is currently fighting trade disputes over are Argentinian textiles, Indian solar panels, and European cheese.In Ireland, consumers can expected to be affected by the trade war in the form of a sharp jump in price on products including orange juice, bourbon and cranberries before the summer is out.Jack Daniel's bourbon is among the leading brands affected, and fresh orange juice such as Tropicana could also be hit.Groceries here are already among the dearest in Europe.Other goods set to be impacted are cranberry juice, peanut butter, cosmetics and jeans imported to the EU from the United States.With Ireland already having the third-highest prices for goods and services in the EU, the tariffs are likely to have a disproportionate impact on shoppers here.Food prices here are 17pc higher than the European Union average, according to Eurostat, the European Commission's official statistics unit.Irish Independent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, exports to China, driven principally by dairy and pig meat, grew by 5pc to â‚¬700m.International trade sanctions have already had a drastic impact on Irish industry this year.Concerns about US sanctions on Russia led to worry about the future of the Aughinish Alumina plant in Co Limerick.

He has since temporarily excluded the European Union and six other allies from the duties and given them until May 1 to negotiate permanent exemptions.A&P Grain President Dave Altepeter said the steel used in their bins is made in the United States, but domestic steel prices also have soared because of the tariffs.U.S. steel mills typically adjust their prices once a year, normally in the first quarter, Altepeter said. But this year, those prices have jumped four times, he said.The price of steel used in A&Pâ€™s grain bins has jumped about 20 percent since January 1.â€œAny time thereâ€™s any type of negative talk that affects the steel mill, theyâ€™ve raised the price,â€? said Altepeter.Last year, about 95,000 tons of steel was shipped to the agriculture industry, compared to the 14 million tons for the U.S. auto industry, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry group.Other factors had been driving up steel prices before the recent trade disputes, including an improving global economy and accelerating manufacturing and construction, particularly in the U.S.The White House referred questions from Reuters to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which did not respond to a request for comment. Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue have vowed the U.S. government will protect farmers from Chinaâ€™s tariffs, but not explained how.U.S. farmers can ill-afford any loss of sales. Farm income has dropped by more than half since 2013, following years of massive harvests that have depressed prices for staples such as corn and soybeans.U.S. competitors Brazil, Argentina and Russia have all raised grain output in recent years, eating into the U.S. share of global markets. Mexico imported ten times more corn from Brazil last year and is set to buy even more in 2018 on worries that renegotiations of the NAFTA trade pact could disrupt their U.S. supplies.Strom said he has also pushed back plans to build a new metal storage building to house his planter and the combine head he uses for harvesting corn and soybeans. Other farmers, food producers and beer makers have scrambled to finalize deals for steel-based equipment before prices climb more.CONSTRUCTION POSTPONEDIn Riverton, Illinois, farmer Allen Entwistle said he postponed construction of a new $800,000 storage system for grain after AGCO Corpâ€™s (AGCO.N) GSI unit increased prices by 15 percent.Entwistle, who voted for Trump, will instead store corn in bags on the ground.â€œPresident Trump keeps telling us heâ€™s going to get a better deal,â€? Entwistle said. â€œWhen are we gonna make it better?â€?AGCO said Trumpâ€™s tariffs will raise its costs and make price hikes to customers unavoidable.â€œAs the entire grain storage industry has weathered increased steel prices, AGCO and GSI are constantly looking for new ways to maximize efficiency and minimize the impact to customers,â€? said spokeswoman Kelli Cook.Other companies, including Deere and Caterpillar, are also facing pain from rising steel prices, which account for about 10 percent of equipment manufacturersâ€™ direct costs.Deere CEO Samuel Allen told Reuters last month the company will have to absorb the price increase and cut costs elsewhere. Chinaâ€™s threatened tariffs on U.S. crops could hurt the company even more by undermining demand from farmers, he said.â€œThis has a huge effect on livelihood of the farmer right now, and at the same time it has a huge impact on manufacturers,â€? said Dennis Slater, president at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, an industry group.U.S. net farm income is forecast to drop to $59.5 billion in 2018 dollars, down from $64.9 billion in 2017, an 8.3 percent decline, according to the USDA.TARIFF â€˜DOOM-AND-GLOOMâ€™In Sheffield, Iowa, Sukup Manufacturing has seen steel prices soar 40 percent since November, said Brent Hansen, the companyâ€™s commercial accounts manager.The maker of grain bins and pre-manufactured steel buildings has encouraged customers to buy quickly before prices jump more. But some have already postponed projects, Hansen said.â€œThatâ€™s obviously a big price increase for an industry thatâ€™s a little bit doom-and-gloom over tariffs,â€? Hansen said.Sukup used to give customers up to two months to consider its bids for projects. Now, it allows just a week in some cases because of volatile steel prices, Hansen said.Prices have jumped by 25 percent for thermal insulated panels that keep food cold â€“ which can use either steel, aluminum or both, said Glenn Todd, owner of Todd Construction Services. The company has built food processing and storage facilities for Bumble Bee Seafoods and poultry company Foster Farms.Richard Adkins, director of sales at Discovery Designs Refrigeration in Mukwonago, Wisconsin, thought his company wouldnâ€™t have to worry about Trumpâ€™s tariffs. Most of the metal they use to design industrial refrigeration systems comes from Canada and Mexico, he said, and the president has exempted both countries from the levies.It didnâ€™t matter. Price-hike notices from vendors landed in Adkinsâ€™ mailbox days after Trump announced the duties.â€œThereâ€™s this knee-jerk reaction,â€? Adkins said. â€œWeâ€™re quoting prices for projects that wonâ€™t be awarded for another six or eight months, and no one wants to be hung out to dry.â€?For Stories Like This and MoreDownload the FarmIreland AppReuters",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Image Source : AP Trump may raise tariff on Chinese goodsIn an escalation to the trade war with China, US President Donald Trump has ordered his administration to consider raising the tariffs on Chinese goods. As talks between Washington and Beijing remain at a standstill, Trump advised to double the proposed tariff from 10 per cent to 25 per cent, on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.Trump on Wednesday instructed the US trade representative to contemplate an increase in tariffs to 25 per cent, on Chinese imports. The imports include petroleum, refrigerators, fish, handbags, chemicals and others.The hike in tariffs would come on top of the existing penalties on $34 billion worth of products and an additional $16 billion that are scheduled to go into effect soon, The New York Times reported.'The increase in the possible rate of the additional duty is intended to provide the administration with additional options to encourage China to change its harmful policies and behaviour and adopt policies that will lead to fairer markets and prosperity for all of our citizens,' US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement.'China has illegally retaliated against US workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses,' he said.A final decision on the tariff hike is however not expected before September.'China's position is firm and clear cut,' said Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, in response to the announcement.'It remains unchanged. The blackmailing and pressure by the US will never work on China if the US take measures to further escalate the situation we will surely take countermeasures to firmly uphold our legitimate rights and interests,' he said.China has vowed to respond to any trade measures in kind and it has already imposed its own tariffs on $34 billion worth of American soybeans, pork, electric vehicles and other goods.The administration's trade moves are aimed at forcing China to end what it calls unfair trade practices, including improperly obtaining American intellectual property.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Beijing has recently initiated a crackdown on riskier lending practices to keep debt levels under control. This comes as China and the United States are entangled in a protracted battle over import tariffs and trade practices.Regional governments in China may have racked up an â€œalarmingâ€? 40 trillion yuan (nearly $5.8 billion, or 60 percent of the countryâ€™s GDP) in off-balance sheet borrowings, S&P Global Ratings said on Tuesday.These eye-popping numbers vastly surpass those cited by the Chinese finance ministry, which estimated local government debt at 17.66 trillion yuan, or $2.58 trillion, by the end of August (about 18 percent of Chinaâ€™s GDP in 2017).S&P credit analysts led by Gloria Lu announced on Tuesday that this is â€œa debt iceberg with titanic credit risks.â€?Beijing has previously barred local governments from borrowing money directly; the local governments used separate vehicles in order to overcome official restrictions and quotas and finance infrastructure projects.These bodies are called local government funding vehicles (LGFVs), and essentially are state-owned entities that raise cash â€” mostly from banks â€” and channel it into infrastructure and real estate development projects rolled out by local governments.â€œThis was just another way to ratchet up the amount of hidden government debt for many projects,â€? the report argues.Beijing has recently vowed to keep debt levels under control, a policy that includes a clampdown on riskier financing practices. Cash inflow into many of the LGFVs has declined, leaving officials struggling to fund new projects and pay back old loans.According to the document, heavily indebted local governments could face a default, particularly at â€œweaker prefectural city-level or district-level governments,â€? and the country is likely to require a decade or more to address the so-called â€œhiddenâ€? local government debt.Chinaâ€™s outstanding government debt on balance sheets made up 29.95 trillion yuan (over $4.3 trillion) by the end of 2017, including 16.5 trillion yuan ($2.3 trillion) accumulated through bond issuances since 2015.This comes as China is involved in a debilitating trade war with the United States, which escalated in June when Donald Trump slapped a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, with Beijing responding in kind. In addition, he accused China of what he called â€œunfair trade,â€? including its alleged state-led efforts to steal US technology and intellectual property as well as â€œdiscriminatory technology licensing practices.â€? The POTUS fired another salvo in September, issuing new tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods, triggering a tariff hike on $60 billion of American products from Beijing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"USDAWith President Trump's trade war causing collateral damage for farmers across the country, Trump directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide financial relief to farmers.But will that include relief for sweet cherry growers in Washington? That's unclear. In a press release sent out Monday by the USDA that details how farmers will be assisted by the federal government, sweet cherries were in the 'yet to be determined' category.That could be a big oversight, since cherry growers in Washington say the trade dispute could cost them $86 million. On Monday, Sens. Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray signed a letter with Reps. Dave Reichert and Dan Newhouse urging the Trump administration to include cherries in the relief package.'While the priority for our growers remains an end to the trade disputes, our cherry growers are estimating they will experience up to $86 million in damages from trade wars during the 2018 season,' the letter says. The federal aid package will include an initial $4.7 billion to producers of cotton, corn, dairy, pork, soybeans, sorghum and wheat. The USDA will also purchase another $1.2 billion 'in commodities unfairly targeted by unjustified retaliation,' the USDA press release says.The Pacific Northwest grows more sweet cherries than any other region in the country, the congressional members say. Their growing season is short, from May until August, and sweet cherries cannot be stored. That creates pressure for cherry growers to sell no matter what, even if that means they lose money, the letter states.'We urge you to implement the support our cherry growers are requesting,' says the letter from the congressional members.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Retaliatory tariffs imposed by China on seafood imports from the United States are likely to price some Alaska seafood out of China's domestic market, according to Alexa Tonkovich, executive director of the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute (ASMI).In September, China imposed its own retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion (â‚¬52 billion) worth of US goods following the Trump administration imposing tariffs on $200 billion (â‚¬170 billion) worth of imports from China.Tonkovich told members of the Northwest Fisheries Association (NWFA) at a meeting last week that China's retaliatory tariffs are keeping Alaska seafood from competing for China's coveted middle class consumers.China holds more free trade agreements than the United States with seafood powerhouses such as Iceland and Chile, giving the Asian powerhouse plenty of options for sourcing seafood.'There are plenty of other fish in the sea. Our Chinese customers will seek other suppliers,' she said.With $1 billion on the line, China tariffs will take toll on Alaska seafoodThanks to vocal opposition from Alaska and other seafood-centric states, any seafood exported from the United States to China that is strictly for reprocessing or re-export is not subject to additional tariffs from China.But any Alaska pollock or salmon sent from the United States to China that stays in the market for domestic Chinese consumption is subject to an additional 25 percent tariff on top of pre-existing tariffs.'A lot of Alaska seafood had a 20 percent tax on products already,' Tonkavich said of products going to China. 'Youâ€™re looking at a 45 percent tariff on a piece of black cod from Alaska sold into China.'She said China, in general, is a growing, hard-to-replace market for Alaska seafood and it's also key market for Alaska's high-end products such as black cod, king crab and geoduck.Other US seafood stars such as lobster are also being hit hard by the trade-war inspired tariffs imposed by China. US lobster sales to China in July declined by 64 percent from May and June levels, following China imposing a 25 percent import tariff on the product, reports the Press Herald.Getting off the listGetting a product removed from China's tariff list is still uncharted territory, with US producers and law firms struggling to understand what China is even taxing from the United States.Alaska lawmakers urge Trump to protect seafood trade with ChinaKen Hammer, an international trade attorney with Washington DC-based Trade Pacific, told IntraFish his firm had a list translated by a Chinese law firm it works with a few months ago. But he wasn't sure if the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) released a final list on US products subject to trade war tariffs.Tonkovich sent IntraFish a China tariff schedule put together by the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service from June as her reference list. She said the differences between product lists could be an issue of different translations.Things could go from bad to worseTrump has also threatened to expand his trade war to all Chinese imports as a further negotiating tactic.Tonkovich said things could get even worse for US seafood exports if China decides to review its own list of US products with tariffs and add more as further retaliation.China is Alaska's largest trading partner, with $988 million (â‚¬849.9 million) exported in 2017.'Weâ€™re at a price disadvantage and the gap is widening,' she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Trump Goes After China Again as Trade War EscalatesStock Markets Jun 26, 2018 09:03AM ETInvesting.com - President Donald Trump is making plans for a fresh crackdown on Chinese investment in the U.S.New rules, which could be announced within days, would block firms with at least 25% Chinese ownership from acquiring American companiesinvolved in â€˜industrially significant technologyâ€™, such as robotics and aerospace..Trump is also planning to restrict U.S. companies from selling certain technologies to China, according to the Wall Street Journal.Such a move would counter a Chinese initiative to be a global leader in technology and mark another escalation in the trade conflict between Washington and Beijing, following the threat of tit-for-tat tariffs.Investors are fearful that an all-out trade war could roil financial markets and dent global growth.Trump also fired a warning shot at U.S. trade partners over the weekend, tweeting that they must drop trade barriers and tariffs, even as he imposes them on U.S. imports.Trump Goes After China Again as Trade War EscalatesRelated Articles",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Trade conflict has a way of creating â€œzombieâ€? companies.Consider ZTE (OTC: ZTCOF). The China-based telecommunications equipment provider got a death row pardon from the U.S. government when trade sanctions were lifted, but the damage the company suffered in its three-month limbo could be too great to overcome.ZTEâ€™s fate might be a predictor of how industries awaiting permanent news on tariffs can experience life-threatening harm to their business models and bottom lines. Hereâ€™s a closer look at the ZTE story, with the lessons for investors.To be sure, investors donâ€™t seem greatly worried about the trade battle being waged by President Trump and the rest of the world. Theyâ€™ve chalked up the tariffs and harsh rhetoric to blustery negotiating tactics.Washington imposed the first wave of tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods on July 6, prompting an immediate retaliation from Beijing. Stocks dropped that day but have since recovered. Despite a few tariff-triggered sell-offs along the way, the S&P 500 is up almost 5% year to date:Investors certainly donâ€™t seem to be putting much weight on the possibility that tariffs will cause long-term harm to U.S. companies.But tell that to ZTE, the electronic component supplier that just barely escaped the jaws of death while U.S. legislators decided its fate. Despite the Commerce Department reaching a deal that opens supplies of critical components to ZTE, three months of uncertainty and idle factories have left the firm a fragile shell of its former self.And while ZTEâ€™s banishment and its ensuing freedom arenâ€™t part of the current trade war, the erosion of its fiscal health while waiting in the balance is a situation worth exploring. Itâ€™s a dilemma that threatens many industries awaiting the fate of tariffs, potentially decimating demand or hindering access to affordable supplies.Investor complacency?Investors might be burying their heads in the sand. The trade war already has exerted tangible harm, as reflected by ZTEâ€™s persistent woes.ZTE makes handsets and equipment for telecommunication networks. Itâ€™s been a serial transgressor of sanctions rules forbidding sales to North Korea and Iran. After months of ZTE continually making false statements regarding shipments, the Department of Justice threw down a severe penalty on ZTE, banning U.S. companies from exporting parts to the company.Because ZTE relies on U.S.-made parts to manufacture virtually all of its products, the stiff punishment effectively put the company out of business.Just after the April announcement, ZTEâ€™s stock plunged and investors and customers wondered how the company could maneuver a workaround allowing it to resume business. Like the surly teenager who is accustomed to lax discipline, ZTE assumed it could negotiate with the Commerce Department. Yet policymakers remained firm.In early May, reports of a likely bankruptcy started flying. In an exchange filing the company wrote:â€œAs a result of the Denial Order, the major operating activities of the company have ceased. As of now, the company maintains sufficient cash and strictly adheres to its commercial obligations subject in compliance with laws and regulations.â€?Fast forward a week and President Trump tweeted out a possible lifeline to the company, noting he hoped to â€œwork something outâ€? with the Chinese government.This week the Commerce Department agreed to allow the resumption of exports to ZTE by U.S. companies. In return, ZTE is required to place almost one half a billion dollars in an escrow account, pay a $1 billion fine, replace its board of directors and senior leadership and pay for a team of U.S.compliance officers who will monitor its business for the next 10 years.The jury is out on whether ZTE can resurrect itself.While few U.S. industries have such concentrated supply or demand economics, customers and suppliers to companies in tariffed groups may see permanent damage to their way of doing business, whether the tariffs are reversed or not.Smart investors should do their homework to determine the vulnerability of companies in their portfolio to swings in demand caused by tariffs. Anyone with an easily replaceable product could be at risk as well as any company with a concentrated customer or supplier base in China. Until the dust settles over tit-for-tat tariffs, limit your stakes in export-dependent companies with heavy overseas exposure.P.S. Iâ€™ve found an investment strategy that doesnâ€™t care about tariffs and trade wars. This system makes money in up or down markets, regardless of geopolitical risk or government policy.

"With trade tensions mounting, the latest bombshell out of Washington is a rumor that the Trump administration may prohibit U.S. companies from selling semiconductors to China, Barron's reports. The short-term fallout may include a retaliatory cutoff of key supplies and components that U.S. chipmakers source from China. The longer-term downside is that China is likely to accelerate its efforts to become a major semiconductor-producing nation, which ultimately will erode the worldwide market share enjoyed by U.S.-based manufacturers, Barron's notes.Even companies that suffer no direct effects from these actions are in danger of seeing their share prices plummet as investors dump chipmaking stocks. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) is up by 223% for the past 10 years, through the close on Monday, per Yahoo Finance. Its seven largest components by market capitalization are, also per Yahoo Finance: Intel Corp. (INTC), $241 billion; Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), $197 billion; NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), $137 billion; Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN), $100 billion; Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), $94 billion; Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM), $76 billion; and Micron Technology Inc. (MU), $53 billion. The combined market value of these companies is $898 billion.'Massive Expansion of Powers''Everything happening is what the business community was fearful aboutâ€”the massive expansion of powers,' is how Ed Mills, a Washington-based policy analyst with Raymond James Financial, described the Trump administration's moves to Barron's. 'The administration has extended the definition of national security to include economic security, of not letting our technology secrets out,' observed Mary Lovely, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in comments to Barron's.President Trump's rumored move against chip sales to China partly is an attempt to thwart theft of intellectual property. It also represents an area where the U.S. has ample leverage to pry general trade concessions from China, given China's heavy dependence on chips from U.S. manufacturers, Barron's indicates.NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) are leading producers of chips for applications in artificial intelligence (AI). Given the national security implications for the U.S. of maintaining AI leadership, Barron's suggests that these two manufacturers are especially likely to feel the pinch from any export ban. Already, back in 2015, the U.S. Department of Commerce blocked some sales of NVIDIA and Intel chips to the Chinese supercomputing industry, per Barron's.Recently, the Commerce Department barred sales of fiber-optic components to China, which was devastating to the share prices of U.S. manufacturers in this field, Barron's notes. This action was tied to allegations that the prospective Chinese buyers had violated U.S. sanctions against Iran.IEEPA and CFIUSThe International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA) was enacted during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979 and allows the U.S. president to restrict sales of goods to other countries on national security grounds. This would be the enabling legislation that Trump would use to limit or ban semiconductor sales to China, wrote Barron's.'IEEPA sanctions are often structured such that they preclude a U.S. business from being invested in a business of a third country that's producing goods or services for the targeted state,' as Matt Gold, a former U.S. trade representative, told Barron's. As a result, he added, U.S.-based chipmakers also may be constrained from sharing chip designs with other companies that do business with China. This may be a big problem for firms such as NVIDIA and Qualcomm, which outsource their production abroad, most notably to Taiwan Semiconductor, said Barron's. Intel, on the other hand, has its own factories, the Barron's article added.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), is a body in the executive branch of the U.S. government that reviews foreign investments in the U.S. in relation to national security concerns. This is the group that recommended blocking Broadcom's bid for Qualcomm, Barron's said. Since then, Broadcom shifted its corporate domicile to the U.S. from Singapore. Ed Mills told Barron's that Congress is moving toward expanding CFIUS rules, with the upshot that Chinese firms will find it more difficult to invest in U.S. companies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A U.S. and China trade war has been put on hold, but maybe not for long. For a few weeks this spring, President Trump's Make America Great Again and President Xi Jinping's Made in China 2025 seemed ready to collide. Then came word that China would buy more U.S. goods and the U.S. won't impose harsh new China tariffs.X'Be cool, it will all work out!' Trump tweeted about talks en route to a recent trade deal that China's state-run People's Daily hailed as a 'win-win' for both countries.Trump's throwback vision â€” stressing steel, agriculture, autos and oil â€” may coexist for a while with Xi's prescription for China's centrally planned high-tech, high-income future. But the harmony can't last long in the world's most important economic relationship.Already, Trump, under fire over the China trade truce, said on May 22 it's just a 'start' and then the following day said talks would likely need a 'different structure.' On Tuesday, the White House said it have tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods set up by June 15, though news reports suggesting that a China trade war was back on appeared premature.More broadly, the largely status quo deal won't alter China's grand plan to overtake America's technological leadership by nearly any means necessary. Ultimately, China and the U.S. could erect barriers in strategic sectors, creating an economic cold war that severs closely integrated global supply chains.Blue-chip giants Boeing (BA), Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC) all popped May 21 as Wall Street celebrated Trump's deal with China. While their near-term future in China may be more secure, the longer-term remains as uncertain as ever.Made In China Aims To Belt Foreign RivalsMade in China 2025, the 10-year plan set out three years ago, looks like anything but a win-win for the U.S. or any of Beijing's other major trading partners. Through state subsidies, acquisitions, market access rules and sometimes outright cybertheft, Xi is bent on closing the technological gap, dominating domestic markets and establishing global leadership in advanced sectors such as semiconductors, robotics and artificial intelligence.The official aim is to steadily displace foreign components, achieving 40% self-sufficiency by 2020 and 70% by 2025.Concerns over China's techno-military ambitions are only heightened by its One Belt, One Road trillion-dollar vision to command global trade by financing infrastructure across Asia and into the Middle East, Europe and Africa. China also created the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to rival the World Bank and the D.C. consensus on the global economy.Yet it's unclear if the U.S. has the appetite or strategy to thwart Beijing's ambitions. Just 10 weeks ago Trump tweeted that 'trade wars are good, and easy to win' and then demanded a $200 billion cut in the China trade gap. Yet rather than move beyond tariff skirmishes to a full-blown U.S. and China trade war, Trump gladly took Beijing's pledge to boost American energy and agricultural purchases somewhat. And that modest concession came after Trump pledged leniency for Chinese telecom equipment giant ZTE, which violated sanctions on Iran and North Korea. ZTE had ceased operations after the U.S. banned American companies from working with it.Why Trump Backed Off U.S. And China Trade WarWhy was Trump so quick to relent? He may have favored a unified approach to North Korean diplomacy. Beijing also called his bluff, judging that Trump would have no stomach for a U.S. and China trade war with American farmers in the cross hairs ahead of key midterm elections.Trump also may have realized he had a much weaker hand than he had imagined.His initial threat was a 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of high-tech Chinese imports. But Trump tariffs largely would have hit Chinese ventures of U.S. and other foreign multinationals, the Peterson Institute for International Economics found. The tariffs on mostly intermediate goods would have raised U.S. production costs, hurting competitiveness.'That the tariffs fail to hurt Chinese firms directly should not be a surprise,' wrote Peterson Institute researchers Mary Lovely and Yang Liang. Made in China 2025 is an aspiration, but current Chinese tech prowess still lags that of the U.S. and others, they noted. 'It is impossible to hit tomorrow's exports with today's tariffs.'Trump said something similar about his desire to go easy on ZTE, tweeting that it 'buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies.'A Friday report said that the Trump administration has reached a deal to lift ZTE sanctions in exchange for another financial penalty, restructure management and hire U.S. compliance officers.Still, the U.S.-China trade relationship remains uneasy.U.S. And China Trade War: National Security IssuesThe Trump administration's sudden shift from wielding a big stick to selling more carrots, so to speak, reflected a long-running split between businesses' short-term financial interests and national security concerns about long-term strategic goals, says American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Derek Scissors.Despite a consensus that America must confront China on trade, both sides 'keep fighting over how tough we should be,' he told IBD.Likewise, Scissors says, a growing consensus holds that the U.S. must act multilaterally to hold China to account. Even Trump had a change of heart about the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal cobbled together by President Obama to help counter China's influence in East Asia. Trump relentlessly criticized the 12-nation deal in the campaign. He dropped TPP, never ratified by the Senate, on his fourth day in office. But he recently told top economic advisor Larry Kudlow to explore getting back in.Yet saying we should act multilaterally is easier than doing it, says Scissors. He sees no realistic chance for a TPP revival. Instead, Trump is targeting allies with steel and aluminum tariffs and a new probe into auto imports.For now, America's strategic drift and Trump's status-quo trade deal are playing into China's hands. But Scissors says a cold U.S. and China trade war is coming.A Cold Trade War With 'Chinese Characteristics''We're heading into a cold war with Chinese characteristics,' Scissors said. 'They aren't the Soviets.'Unlike the USSR, China is a rival but not an enemy. And it's fully integrated with the global economy. 'I don't think it gets as bad,' Scissors said.Other nations have sought to climb the income ladder via unfair trade policies to build up national champions. Yet 'China now has the wealth, commercial sophistication and technical expertise to make its pursuit of technological leadership work,' warned James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a submission to the Trump administration's probe of China's technology and intellectual property practices.It boasts the world's fastest supercomputer, half as many tech unicorns as the U.S. (private companies sporting a $1 billion market cap) and wildly successful public companies such as Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY) that can give U.S. FANG stocks a run for their money.'The fundamental issue for the U.S. and other Western nations, and the IT sector, is how to respond to a managed economy with a well-financed strategy to create a domestic industry intended to displace foreign suppliers.'Yet there's also a clear military dimension to China's ambitions to become the leader in areas including artificial intelligence, robotics and aerospace.China Economy Takes A Different RoadThe premise behind allowing China to join the World Trade Organization in 2001 was that trade would force its state-run system to gradually converge with market economies. That opened the door for U.S. multinationals to outsource their assembly lines, capitalizing on China's huge pool of low-wage labor. More recently, Chinese companies have been moving up the value chain, aided by strategic deals but also by technology from foreign joint-venture partners as a price of market access.Many have questioned whether the liberal technology policies of the U.S. and other rich nations ever made sense. Yet now that Beijing is directing a $300 billion national 'self-sufficiency' campaign to minimize reliance on technology from the U.S., Germany, South Korea and others, its bid to buy technology has been met by a chill, if not paranoia.U.S. Blocks China Technology TakeoversIn 2015, when Beijing spelled out Made in China 2025, Chinese investments in U.S. tech startups surged to $9.9 billion from $2.3 billion a year earlier. The tide began to turn at the end of 2016 when President Obama, on the advice of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), blocked the sale of a German chipmaker's U.S. unit to Grand Chip Investment GMBH, owned by a Chinese company.Last year, President Trump nixed a bid by Chinese investors to buy Lattice Semiconductor. In March, Trump blocked a $117 billion Broadcom (AVGO) offer for Qualcomm (QCOM) on national security grounds. The apparent fear was that Broadcom, ready to move its headquarters to the U.S. from Singapore, would sandbag Qualcomm's 5G wireless R&D and give a leg up to China's Huawei. Facing pressure from U.S. lawmakers, AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) this year dropped plans to sell Huawei's new phone in America.Qualcomm has long been in Beijing's sights. China has threatened to derail Qualcomm's merger with Dutch chip firm NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). In 2015, Qualcomm ponied up $1 billion to get out from under a Chinese antitrust probe. Qualcomm seemed to have bought regulatory tolerance, in part by lending its technology to a joint venture with Guizhou Province to produce server chips.China has used such strong-arm tactics to gain proprietary technology, costing U.S. firms upward of $200 billion a year, according to some estimates.But if Beijing won't give up its tacit encouragement of technology transfer as a cost of doing business in China, the U.S. Congress could step into the breach.Congress is weighing legislation to beef up the CFIUS to let it oversee more transactions, including technology transfer agreements, bankruptcy sales and early-stage venture capital deals. The VC industry warns that banning Chinese funds from U.S. investments will push startups to migrate elsewhere.The Trump administration reportedly has mulled curbing Chinese citizens' participation in advanced research at U.S. universities. A Duke University researcher is believed to have transferred knowledge to develop China's new stealth fighter jet.If China continues to resist competitive market dynamics, 'Western nations will naturally turn from managed integration to something more self-protective,' Daniel Rosen, founding partner of the Rhodium Group research firm, wrote in Foreign Affairs.Trade War Costs: 'Trillions Of Dollars'While products such as toys, furniture and apparel could avoid national security scrutiny, Rosen sees a real risk of disengagement in strategic areas.Countries don't follow Econ 101 textbook examples with trade only in finished goods. Modern supply chains and investment links often involve a myriad of countries for a single product, especially for tech goods.The breakup could happen in stages, as China marches toward Xi's 2025 goals. Or the impact on technology supply chains could be more violent, like a major slow-moving earthquake.Consider the chip industry in which U.S. and China trade frictions are highest. China consumes about 60% of the $412 billion semiconductor market, but three-fourths of those chips are imported (even factoring in foreign multinational output in China). No Chinese firms rank in the top 20 producers. Those chips are then assembled into finished electronics like the Apple iPhone, the bulk of which are shipped overseas. High-tech exports in the first quarter totaled $138 billion.'The cost of disengagement will be severe for China, the United States, and third parties,' Rosen wrote. 'It is possible that when China and the United States stare these hard realities in the eye, with adjustment costs likely to run into the trillions of dollars over the next decade, they will seek an alternative.'But with Beijing working to 'hardwire its system not to converge,' a long-term U.S. and China trade war becomes increasingly likely, he said.China's leaders aren't willing to trust their country's future to the free market. Wages in China have leapt above those in Brazil and Mexico and can't compete with Vietnam or India. The working-age population is shrinking and will keep doing so for decades. To a large extent, if China is going to remain the world's manufacturing giant and join the ranks of rich nations, it will have to depend on robots and other technology, such as artificial intelligence.China's ascendancy is hardly a sure thing. 'Like many grandiose ambitions of central planning, the more spectacular elements will likely fall by the wayside,' Council on Foreign Relations research associate Lorand Laskai wrote of Beijing's AI roadmap. 'However, the plan might still succeed if only because China is committing resources to a societywide AI push' and reorienting the education system to train Chinese students to work with AI.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Gave Up His Best Leverage In China Trade Talks â€” For Beans?Alibaba Price-Target Raised On Continued China E-Commerce DominanceThese Stocks Rally After Trump Cancels North Korea SummitBest Chinese Stocks To Buy And WatchShould I Buy Stocks Now?

"Minister of Trade and Industry Dr Rob Davis speaks during the opening of the 10th BRICS Summit at the Sandton Convention Centre, Johannesburg. Picture: Itumeleng English/African News AgencyANAâ€œBRICS provides the only true counterweight to the potential global trade wars playing out,â€? Stavros Nicolaou, a senior executive at Aspen Pharmacare said to me this week at the BRICS Summit in Johannesburg. The BRICS formation is acting as a bulwark against US unilateralism and hegemony, and this theme has been woven through the fabric of discussions at the landmark Summit this week marking a decade of collaboration between Brazil, Russia, China, India and South Africa.The US has made it quite clear that South Africa will be penalised just as heavily as its other traditional trading partners through the imposition of new tariffs on aluminium and steel. Instead of the US administration putting things into perspective in that South Africa only accounts for 1% of US steel imports, but that 1% represents a significant amount of revenue and jobs for the South African economy, the US has refused to reconsider its decision when it comes to South Africa. There is absolutely no consideration given to supporting South Africaâ€™s development agenda or priority given to job creation in this country.Contrast that to Chinese President Xi Jinpingâ€™s remarks this week that China and South Africa are brothers, friends, partners and comrades. President Xi said China is committed to supporting South Africaâ€™s development agenda in terms of job creation, manufacturing, industrialisation and development financing. For China, it goes beyond words, as we witnessed with the announcement this week that China has committed US$14,7 billion of investment in our economy, US$2.5 billion of which is a lifeline for Eskom at a time when Eskom desperately needs to raise R72 billion this year.Consider also that the current Chinese Ambassador spent his weekends for months on end earlier this year visiting our Special Economic Zones in provinces throughout the country in order to study the strengths and challenges with a view to attracting Chinese investors to the zones, many of which are in desperate need of investors. He then brought 100 Chinese business executives to visit the Coega Industrial Development Zone last month in a push to bring investors to speed up the manufacturing sector in this country.Then there is the vision that the Chinese Ambassador has articulated to bring close to a million Chinese tourists to South Africa in the short term. This is surely more than doable considering there are around 120 million Chinese tourists travelling abroad, so attracting a million to South Africa shouldnâ€™t be too hard, and it represents a huge cash injection into our economy.It is difficult not to compare this genuine interest in our development with the fact that since President Donald Trump came to office he hasnâ€™t even bothered to appoint a US ambassador to South Africa.But as Minister for Trade and Industry Rob Davies alluded to this week, there will be pushback from South Africa to US intransigence on the trade front. South Africa had certain guarantees from the US with regards to trade access according to our benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and these new tariffs are in breach of agreed trade access.Davies has warned that the poultry industry in South Africa is preparing to launch a court challenge against the highly controversial concessions that South Africa made to the US in terms of allowing US chicken into our market. This was fiercely contested by our own poultry industry, and now the argument will be made that given the US breach of our AGOA benefits, why should we continue letting in cheap American chicken to undercut our own producers?I canâ€™t help mentioning that while the US has its own small-scale trade war on the go with South Africa, China has taken significant steps forward in terms of allowing access for South African beef into the Chinese market, presenting huge export opportunities for us. Add to this the fact that President Xi Jinping promised this week to ensure that more Chinese buying missions come to South Africa.The Chinese have given South Africa Special Guest Status at their landmark International Import Expo in November, the first of its kind, which will showcase an array of South African products that will be of interest to Chinese consumers. This is Chinaâ€™s way of showing that their economy is open to South African (and other) business and is seeking ways to bring value-added and manufactured products to the Chinese market, not only raw materials.When the US talks about rebalancing the global trading system, what it really means is rebalancing it in the interests of America, not in the interests of the majority in the international community, and certainly not in the interests of the developing south. That, my friends, is why BRICS is so relevant for our future â€“ it is a way for us to leverage development financing, especially for infrastructure, and without infrastructure, we cannot even begin to reverse the low levels of intra-African trade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Investor walks in front of private stock trading boards at a private stock market gallery in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Friday, Oct. 5, 2018. Asian markets were mostly lower on Friday after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence claimed China had meddled with its midterm elections to unsettle the Trump administration, which Beijing has denied.(AP Photo/Yam G-Jun)JOHANNESBURG - We have witnessed a long wave of increased global trade over the past 200 years, facilitated in part by ongoing advances in transportation and technology, such as the steel hulled ship, containerisation, refrigeration and jet travel. At the same time, economies of scale and scope have driven down relative trade costs, which have fallen by 85percent between the early 1800s and now, opening up a world of opportunity. However, this process has not all been smooth sailing (pun intended), with regular outbreaks of trade wars over the centuries. The most recent episode is the trade war that has broken out between the US and China.And with US President Donald Trump threatening to raise import duties on an additional $267billion (R4trillion) worth of Chinese products, it is worth pausing to reflect on what the trade wars of the past can teach us about the likely outcomes of the current dispute, especially as South Africa seems likely to get caught up in the crossfire.Despite Twitter claims to the contrary, lessons from the past reveal trade wars seldom produce winners and more often than not, the results leave both sides battle-bruised, scarred and worse off for the affair. In fact, the comic names of many of these trade tiffs - the Battle of the Bananas, the Pasta Spat, Chicken Friction - not only belie the animosity invariably surrounding these disputes, but also their damaging consequences.Instead, history teaches us that past trade disputes have led to heightened geopolitical tension and dampened global economic growth, which in turn have sparked social crises, wars and economic depressions. Take, for example, one of the most famous trade wars of the modern era, initiated under the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. In an eerie parallel to current events, this act was passed by US lawmakers with the promise of protecting American jobs, particularly in the agricultural sector.Attempting to ease the effects of the Great Depression, the act subsequently raised US import duties from 15percent to more than 40percent on nearly 1000 items ranging from eggs and sugar to oil drums. This strategy did not turn out as planned. US import and export volumes plunged 40percent over the next two years as trade partners retaliated by raising their own tariffs in a tit-for-tat trade war. The knock-on results saw prices of goods and services falling, unemployment surging, banks collapsing and world trade plunging.The decade following the Great Depression saw a halving in global trade. And as crop prices fell and exports dried up, the American farmers who were supposed to benefit from the trade protection policy instead suffered perhaps the most of all. Far from the heroic measure needed, the Smoot-Hawley Act is now widely blamed for amplifying the depression and, if not instigating, at least contributing to the eruption of World War II.There is a difference between the Smoot-Hawley Act and Trumpâ€™s trade proposals in that the Smoot-Hawley Act raised tariffs against everyone, whereas Trumpâ€™s focus has remained largely on Mexico and China.However, the outcome is likely to be the same, as world economies are even more interdependent now than they were in the 1930s.Tlotliso Phakisi is an investment analyst at Cannon Asset Managers.'PERSONAL FINANCE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Twenty-five leading retailersâ€”including Macyâ€™s, J.C. Penney, Kohlâ€™s, and Walmartâ€”have appealed to President Trump not to slap tariffs on Chinese products, saying the resulting increase in prices would hurt American consumers.â€œIn the U.S., those who can afford less pay more because the U.S. levies the highest tariffs on basic consumer goods,â€? the letter said. â€œFor example, families shopping in our stores pay higher prices because America already levies import taxes as much as 32 and 67 percent on basic clothes and shoes. Applying any additional broad-based tariff [would] punish American working families with higher prices on household basics like clothing, shoes, electronics, and home goods.â€?The letter was organized by the Retail Industry Leaders Association.The National Retail Federation has expressed similar doubts, calling the tariffs a â€œself-inflicted woundâ€? on the American economy.â€œA tariff is a tax, plain and simple,â€? said president and CEO Matthew Shay in a statement. â€œIn this case, itâ€™s an unnecessary tax on every American family.â€¦ The retail industry is extremely concerned by the administrationâ€™s apparent desire to ignite a trade war, where the net losers will be the very people the president wants to help.â€?On March 22, President Trump said he would direct the U.S. trade representative to levy 25 percent tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, in retaliation for what he called Chinaâ€™s lax enforcement of intellectual property laws.â€œWe have a trade deficit, depending on the way you calculate, of $504 billion,â€? the president said. â€œNow, some people would say itâ€™s really $375 billion. Many different ways of looking at it, but any way you look at it, it is the largest deficit of any country in the history of our world. Itâ€™s out of control. We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on, which likewise is hundreds of billions of dollars.â€?In response, China announced new tariffs effecting $3 billion in U.S. goods. They will reportedly include a 25 percent tariff on U.S. pork imports and recycled aluminum, as well as 15 percent tariffs on American steel pipes, fruit, and wine.â€œChina does not want a trade war with anyone,â€? said a statement from the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. â€œBut China is not afraid of and will not recoil from a trade warâ€¦. If a trade war were initiated by the US, China would fight to the end to defend its own legitimate interests with all necessary measures.â€?Regardless, the president said he was determined to go ahead, tweeting that trade wars are â€œgood, and easy to win.â€?(Image courtesy of the White House)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indonesian President Joko Widodo has likened global trade wars with the 'Infinity War' of the Avengers comic and film franchise at an economic forum in Hanoi. 'What is happening in the economy today is that we are heading to the Infinity War,' said Joko at the World Economic Forum on ASEAN. 'Not since the Great Depression of the 1930s have trade wars erupted with the intensity that they have today.' The US, the world's largest economy, is locked in a trade dispute with China, with President Donald Trump threatening increased tariffs on some $US200 billion ($A282 billion) of goods on top of $50 billion imposed this year. He has previously referred to trade wars as 'good' and 'easy to win.' Trump, who imposed tariffs on steel against Canada and Mexico earlier this year, has also threatened to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement. But Joko said trade wars would only hinder global economic progress and could reduce the living standards of billions of people. 'But rest assured, I and my fellow Avengers stand ready to prevent Thanos from wiping out half the world's population,' he added, referring to the franchise's villain. Joko, who was speaking to an assembled group of South-East Asian leaders including Singapore's Lee Hsien Loong and Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi, added that he did not intend to single out any particular person. 'Thanos is the mistaken belief that in order to succeed, others must surrender, he is the misperception that the rise of some means the decline of others,' he said.

"South Dakota AG Community: Critics of Trade War & Bailout PlanThe president announced Tuesday, July 25th, a $12 billion plan to pay farmers for their losses and find new global markets.However, some in South Dakotaâ€™s ag industry say a bailout wonâ€™t stop the damaging domino effect of the trade war with China.â€œItâ€™s kind of a poor bandaid to put on for the time being,â€? said Scott Stahl, a soybean and corn farmer in Emery, SD.Many farmers including Stahl see the $12 billion aid as a short term solution.â€œOverall farmers are not interested in receiving a check, what we want is trade, said Stahl.Scott VanderWal, Vice President of South Dakota Farm Bureau says the money will help some farmers financially.â€œItâ€™ll likely help keep some farmers and ranchers in business,â€? said VanderWal.However, a big concern for everyone is losing such an impactful overseas market like China, which accounts for over 40 percent of U.S. soybean exports or $1.1 billion.â€œIt doesnâ€™t help to overall heal a trade relationship thatâ€™s been damaged because of the policy, said Stahl.â€œItâ€™s hard to see because weâ€™ve worked hard to establish those relationships.â€?â€œIt takes a long time to get those overseas markets back once you lose them,â€? said VanderWal.Even with aid, long term the trade war could create a negative effect for everyone since South Dakotaâ€™s economy greatly depends on agriculture.Due to loss of money, some may not find it beneficial to stay in the business.â€œWe can see farmers going out of business on both ends of the age range and if farmers start going out of business that also takes with it the businesses in the small towns that cater to agriculture like seed and feed businesses, chemicals, fertilizer. And If those go away then our small towns die,â€? said VanderWal.Farmers understand something has to be done with China.â€œWe wouldnâ€™t dispute that thereâ€™s been a trade imbalance. Weâ€™re here to help solve that. Itâ€™s just disappointing to see farmers used as the pawn in helping settle that trade dispute,â€? said Stahl.In the end farmers say what they want is free trade and not aid moving forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Any trade war between the United States and China is worrisome, but if it escalated and tariffs are imposed, it will hit Washington particularly hard. Avoiding that possibility should be our primary goal.Our state is our nationâ€™s third largest exporter with more than half of the containers leaving the Puget Sound heading to China. The Port of Seattle estimated that China trade alone accounted for $18 billion last year and 40 percent of our stateâ€™s jobs are now tied to trade.President Trump has proposed tariffs as a bargaining chip to get better deal for American exporters and to punish the Chinese theft of intellectual property. He also wants to cut into our $50 billion trade deficit with China.The President frets that the â€œMade in China 2025,â€? the aggressive initiative designed to dominate strategic sectors, such as industrial robots, components for electric vehicles and semiconductors, will put our country at a significant commercial and military disadvantage.China retaliated with its own tariff plan consisting of a series of 25 and 15 percent charges.If a 25 percent tariff was levied on Boeing commercial aircraft, it could hurt Washington and impact the companyâ€™s orders, deliveries and production. After supplying more than a thousand 737s to China, Boeing recently listed 273 unfilled orders of 737s destined for China airlines.So far, only the 737-800 and 737-900ER were among the $50 billion in Chinese tariffs announced in early April; however, if the trade disputes widens, more Boeing aircraft may be added, former Washington Governor and Ambassador to China Gary Locke worries.â€œChinaâ€™s retaliation is best understood as an economic and political demonstration,â€? the Wall Street Journal editorialized, â€œhitting a small number of products to signal where future blows could fall if the Trump Administration imposes punitive tariffs on $60 billion in Chinese good to punish the theft of intellectual property.â€? Tariffs on Americaâ€™s biggest exports to China, such as soybeans and Boeing jets, are currently held in reserve.But for Washington the immediate threat is the 15 percent tariff which may be placed on cherries, apples and wine. With the cherry crop ripening in early summer, the impact would be the most noticeable.Keith Hu with the Northwest Cherry Growers Association told KOMO News: â€œEverybody is getting pretty nervous about it.â€? China is the top export market and last year, it bought 33,000 tons of premium cherries worth $140 million.Besides cherries, China purchased $50 million of apples and $1.2 million in Washington wines in 2017.In addition to airplanes and farm products, our state exported more than $1 billion in vehicles and parts, wood products, medical and surgical equipment and other goods.China has a couple of other leverage points we canâ€™t ignore. The Beijing government can pare back on its purchase of U.S. debt. It is our largest foreign debt holder pegged at $1.7 trillion.â€œChina has many ways it can make life exceedingly uncomfortable for a large number of American businesses, both those that hoping for access to Chinaâ€™s fast-expanding market and those that use China as an important part of their supply chains,â€? said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University professor of international trade, in the New York Times.Hopefully, President Trump is correct in his assurances that a trade war between the United States and China is not imminent and the stock markets here and abroad will settle down.Most importantly, a deal needs be worked out which will give us better protections for intellectual properties and a more even playing field for our products. The best approach would be to dial back the rhetoric and bring people to the bargaining table.Don Brunell is a business analyst, writer and columnist.

"KBJR via CNNNEW YORK (CNNMoney) - President Donald Trump's trade wars have reached Silicon Valley.The Trump administration is considering tariffs on networking equipment from China. That could spell trouble for companies that buy Chinese components for their global cloud computing operations, such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, analysts say.And chip makers such as Intel could face tariffs on computer chips. US companies often send mostly finished chips to China for assembly, testing and packaging. Those companies could pay a penalty when those chips are shipped back into the country.So far, US tech giants have largely stayed out of the trade fight. The threat of tariffs on tech products from China could force Silicon Valley leaders to be more vocal about their concerns.'[As you see] what types of products they're hitting, I think it becomes a lot more tangible, and a lot more real' for tech companies, said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research at GBH Insights.Modems and routers are on a list of Chinese goods worth $200 billion that could face 10% tariffs in the United States after August 30. A tariff on those products could also hurt the tech industry, which uses huge IT networks to deliver products and services around the globe.China accounted for almost half of the roughly $23 billion of IT network gear the United States imported in the 12 months through April, according to Panjiva, a global trade research company owned by S&P Global Market Intelligence.Companies will either need to find alternative suppliers from outside China, or cope with higher prices, said Chris Rogers, a Panjiva research analyst. Some suppliers could end up relocating from China to Vietnam or Malaysia, he added.Amazon, Facebook and Google can probably absorb small, temporary increases in cost, according to Ives. The bigger concern is that tariffs will disrupt their supply chains, causing delays and slowing product rollouts, he said.The Information Technology Industry Council, which represents major IT users like Google, Facebook and Microsoft, sounded the alarm when the list including modems and routers was released by the Trump administration on Tuesday.The president's decision to institute more tariffs 'without a clear objective or end in sight' would threaten both US jobs and investment, the group said.'We urge President Trump to delay this unnecessary escalation before more consumers and workers are harmed,' Dean Garfield, the president of the council, said in a statement.American chipmakers are also worried. Duties of 25% on roughly $3 billion in semiconductors, which were proposed in June, remain on the table.The Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents top US chipmakers such as Intel and Qualcomm, has called the planned tariffs 'counterproductive.''What's being imported from China are chips made by US companies that happen to pass through the China supply chain,' said Jimmy Goodrich, the group's vice president for global policy.In a report Thursday, Fitch Ratings listed both Intel and Texas Instruments as vulnerable to tariffs because they move product parts around the world.'Semiconductors are not on the Chinese tariff list as it stands now, but they could be included later if China takes a tougher line on tech imports,' Fitch said. 'Intel could also face higher component costs if US tech tariffs are imposed.'Intel declined comment. Google, Facebook and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Silicon Valley leaders have been critical of Trump's policies on immigration and the environment. But they've been more muted when it comes to trade.Most visible has been Apple CEO Tim Cook, who visited Trump to discuss trade in April. Cook told CNN last month that he was 'very optimistic' that the United States would not escalate its trade fight with other countries.'That's going to be a lose-lose, and when the facts are so clear like that, I believe both parties will see that,' he said.One issue: China's trade practices remain a touchy issue for much of the tech world. Many in Silicon Valley support government efforts to stop intellectual property theft and increase market access for US companies â€” even if they disagree on whether tariffs are the best way to change China's behavior.The growing likelihood of tariffs on tech parts, however, could cause executives to speak out more forcefully.'If this trade war continues to heat up with technology products and services front and center, I ultimately think you're going to see a lot more executives following the lead of Cook' and engaging with Washington, Ives said.-- CNNMoney's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SALT LAKE CITY â€” The expansion of import and export tariffs between the United States and its largest international trading partner will not serve either nation well in the long-term, a senior Chinese diplomat said during a visit with top Utah leaders Tuesday.'We do not think that imposing tariffs is a good choice to resolve trade disputes,' said Xu Xueyuan, minister of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the U.S.Speaking Tuesday to members of the media in the board room at the Utah State Capitol, she said that there is approximately $584 billion in trade between the two countries, with huge opportunities for increased commerce in many business sectors.Responding to President Donald Trump's administration last week imposing 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods, with another $16 billion on the horizon later this month, Xueyuan said conducting a trade war would hurt the economic interests of both countries.The Associated Press reported that the list of possible new tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese imports could escalate into a full-scale trade war. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative proposed 10 percent tariffs Tuesday on a list of 6,031 Chinese product lines. In response, China has imposed similar tariffs on American products.Speaking about America's $375 million trade deficit with China, Xueyuan offered an alternative to imposing more and more tariffs.'We think the best way to work out solutions is through negotiation and dialogue,' she said. '(A) better choice than imposing tariffs could be (for China) to import more from the United States.'She said creating a better balance of trade would help both countries prosper. Growing conflict of any kind between China and the United States will only work against the interests of each nation, she said.'If a war erupts, whether hot or cold, it will hurt everybody,' Xueyuan said. 'There won't be winners from war, there will only be losers.'Xueyuan led a delegation of Chinese diplomatic officials visiting Utah in an effort to further relations between the world's most populous nation and the Beehive State. The group met with various state and local leaders as well as members of the local Chinese community on Tuesday. The group is scheduled to meet with Gov. Gary Herbert on Wednesday.She said the delegation is interested in learning from the ideas of the people of Utah.'We're here to hear thoughts from people of all walks of life, not just government officials,' she said. '(We are interested in) your thoughts on the China-U.S. relationship and how the embassy can do a better job to help enhance this relationship.'Xueyuan said Utah has played a 'leading role' in language learning through implementation of dual immersion programs that teach young students a second language, with Chinese among the most popular.Related:'That's our livelihood': Will China's increased tariffs impact Utah's agriculture industry? The Beehive State exports millions of dollars worth of pork and fruit to China yearly. Some farmers and ranchers are concerned after China announced increased tariffs on these products Monday as part of an ongoing trade dispute.'When you learn a language, you will understand the culture and traditions behind this language,' she said. 'By learning the language, it brings the relationship between people closer to each other and also provides better job opportunities.'She said China is very interested in continuing to cultivate its ongoing relationship with Utah.Rep. Robert Spendlove, R-Sandy, was among the Utah lawmakers who met privately with the minister and the Chinese delegation. He said each side expressed a commitment to continue to work together for both countries' mutual benefit. He also said each side should work to resolve their trade issues.'There is valuable perspective from the (Trump) administration about some of the problems we've had in the past,' he said. 'But we need to be really careful about the way we address that, make sure that we have an appropriate response given those concerns.'He noted that the Chinese delegation was aware of the state's frustration regarding the trade war and showed a willingness to work together to address this ongoing issue.Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes, R-Draper, said he hopes Utah can play a leading role in showing officials in Washington how to strengthen diplomatic, cultural and economic relationships through implementing 'best practices' in the way the state handles its business with crucial trading partners like China.'We can be an example that other states can look at as well as our federal government. Conversations are better than not having them,' he said. 'We had a constructive and collaborative conversation. It's longer-range hope that we are lowering barriers to trade amongst our trading partners.'Ã—Related Stories",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many are paying more for imported supplies, enduring falling sales overseas, or both, forcing them to put hiring and investment plans on hold.Trump administration officials argue the tariffs are necessary to protect U.S. steel makers that have suffered as foreign producers dumped metals in this country at below-market prices. The taxes are also aimed at prodding China and other countries to reduce longstanding high tariffs on U.S. imports, potentially opening those markets to American companies.To be sure, the trade war has produced some winners, including American steel makers and washing machine manufacturers that have benefited from the tariffs placed on their foreign competitors' exports to the U.S.But their ranks are dwarfed by the losers.

And if President Donald Trump makes good on threats to levy duties on hundreds of billions of dollars more in imports, the pain for Main Street businesses will grow exponentially.Trump has slapped tariffs on about $50 billion of imported steel and aluminum and $34 billion on an array of technology and other goods from China. Another $16 billion in duties on Chinese imports took effect Thursday. China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union have responded with tit-for-tat tariffs on U.S. shipments to their countries, from motorcycles and blue jeans to whiskey and orange juice.If those taxes stay in place, it would shave a modest tenth of a percentage point off U.S. economic growth and reduce employment by 170,000 over the next year, says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moodyâ€™s Analytics. The economy is expected to grow a solid 3 percent this year.â€œItâ€™s having an impact, but itâ€™s not a big enough impact on the broader economy,â€? Zandi says, noting growth has been juiced by the sweeping Republican tax cuts.But, he says, if Trump follows through with all $800 billion of his threatened tariffs, largely against China, and other countries retaliate as expected, it would slice growth by 1.6 percentage points and employment by another 2.6 million, tipping the economy into recession.Already, thousands of businesses are feeling the effects. Hereâ€™s how some are coping.Struggling farmer takes another hitIllinois farmer Brian DuncanHandoutBrian Duncan, 53, a midsize corn, soybean and hog farmer with 4,000 acres in Polo, Illinois, already had been grappling with thinner profits. The culprit has been a surplus of global crop supplies fostered by favorable weather and the expectation of rising demand. Now, retaliatory tariffs by China and Mexico have crimped demand in those countries, reducing market prices for his products by 16 percent to 27 percent since April.If the tariffs remain, Duncan expects his sales over the next year to fall by $1.5 million in his hog business, about $400,000 in corn and $100,000 in soybeans. Duncan has 3,500 acres of corn and 500 acres of soybeans. And he raises 70,000 hogs a year that are sold to giant pork producers such as Tyson Foods and Smithfield Foods.â€œThe trade war has swung me from a half-million-dollar profit to a half-million-dollar loss,â€? the 35-year, third-generation farmer says.As a result, heâ€™s putting off plans to buy a new tractor and combine.â€œYouâ€™re always trying to expand and grow the business,â€? he says. But now, â€œthat doesnâ€™t seem like a wise thing to do.â€œI recognize thereâ€™s trade issues that need to be dealt with,â€? he says. â€œBut I think thereâ€™s a better way. â€¦ The way weâ€™re going about it is like a bull in a china shop.â€?Tariff is like anchor for boat makerbilly earginUSA todayCorrect Craft, the Florida boat maker, is getting hit by both sides of the trade skirmish.After current contracts with suppliers expire in a couple of months, it will pay 20 percent to 30 percent more for the aluminum that makes up the shell of some of its boats, and 5 percent to 15 percent more for aluminum parts that go in the boats, says CEO Yeargin.The company buys those supplies domestically, but the 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports is allowing U.S. makers to raise their prices as well, since they no longer have to compete aggressively with low-priced foreign rivals. And the tariffs are â€œgiving them coverâ€? to boost prices by even more than the 10 percent duty, Yeargin says.The extra taxes will increase the companyâ€™s costs by hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, he says.The bigger problem, Yeargin says, is that exports to 70 countries make up 30 percent of the companyâ€™s $500 million in annual sales. And Canada, Mexico and the European Union have slapped tariffs â€“ of 10 percent, 15 percent and 25 percent, respectively â€“ on all power boats from the U.S. Initially, he says, orders from overseas dealers came to a dead halt.Customers â€œdonâ€™t want to be the ones who bought a boat with a 25 percent tariff,â€? Yeargin says, especially if the duty is temporary.Then, the company decided to provide rebates to offset 20 percent to 50 percent of the tariffs. Now, Yeargin says, the hit to sales is modest, but â€œitâ€™s costing us millions of dollars.â€?Correct Craft has suspended plans to expand factories and hire dozens of workers in coming months. â€œWe're not approving any new growth initiatives,â€? he says.And the reduced sales and profits could crimp the annual bonuses of Craftâ€™s 1,300 employees.The strong economy has been a boon for U.S. boat makers, with Correctâ€™s sales rising more than 20 percent annually in recent years. Yet Yeargin worries that customers who put off a boat purchase may take up another hobby instead.â€œOnce they get out, they may never get back to boating,â€? he says.Beer-can costs add upOctopi Brewing CEO Isaac ShowakiMike GorskiEven seemingly trivial increases can have outsize effects.Octopi Brewing, a contractor in Waunakee, Wisconsin, that makes beer for other brewers, is paying 15 percent more for aluminum cans since the tariff took effect a few months ago. Its supplier has increased its price from 10.5 cents a can to 12 cents, says Isaac Showaki, president of the 3-year-old company.That doesnâ€™t sound like much, but it adds up to about $100,000 a year for a company that churns out a few million cans of beer annually. â€œWhen youâ€™re talking about millions of units, youâ€™re talking about real money,â€? says Showaki, 34.Initially, Octopi absorbed the added cost, but now itâ€™s passing it along to its brewing-company customers. Still, thereâ€™s a lag until Octopi can recover those extra costs â€“ about $30,000 so far â€“ from customers. Thatâ€™s reducing the companyâ€™s cash flow.â€œThatâ€™s money we could have spent on hiring people,â€? Showaki says, noting Octopi sales have been growing 50 percent a year and the company had planned to add two to three workers. â€œIt just puts a brake on everything. It just makes you slow down.â€?Auto parts maker fights for its lifeMary Buchzeiger, CEO, Lucerne International IncAnnistique PhotographyLucerne International, an auto parts supplier based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, already has absorbed one blow from the trade war, and itâ€™s bracing for a much bigger one.The company makes about $50 million in parts annually at eight plants in Asia, then ships them back to the U.S. for final production for large automakers.Its part sales to BMW have fallen 20 percent because China raised its tariff on cars it imports from the U.S. to 40 percent in retaliation for Trumpâ€™s higher duties on Chinese goods. BMW builds SUVs in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and exports them to 140 countries, including China. It has scaled back the number of cars it plans to sell in that country because of the levy. And so itâ€™s ordering fewer parts from Lucerne, says the company's CEO, Mary Buchzeiger.The bigger impact will come if Trump follows through on threats to slap a 25 percent tariff on all imported vehicles and auto parts based on national security concerns. Long-term contracts with customers prevent Lucerne from passing along higher material costs or tariffs. And Lucerneâ€™s profit margin is too thin to eat the added expense.â€œI canâ€™t sell the products for less than what it costs me to produce them, and thatâ€™s what would happen with the tariffs,â€? says Buchzeiger, who bought the 25-year-old company from her father in 2015. â€œWeâ€™d be out of business in three months.â€?Lucerneâ€™s revenue has been â€œgangbustersâ€? the past three years, she says, and revenue of nearly $50 million is expected to reach $1 billion in nine years. As a result, the company has considered opening a U.S. plant to reduce its reliance on Asian imports, an initiative that would create 125 jobs. But with the companyâ€™s future hanging in the balance, those plans are on hold, Buchzeiger says.Contributing: Jamie L LaReau of the Detroit Free PressCopyright 2017 USATODAY.com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Published: - Apr 03, 2018China has announced new tariffs on 128 American productsLeer en espaÃ±ol: Â¿Ha comenzado la guerra comercial?After President Trump decided to impose tariffs on aluminum and steel, Chinaâ€™s Commerce Ministry said the measure would â€œseriously impact the normal order of international tradeâ€?. Now, the Chinese government has announced tariffs of up to 25% on US imports, which would have a proportionate impact to that of US duties on Chinese steel and aluminum.In addition to tariffs against several countries, the US administration plans to implement protectionist measures specifically targeting China. As Bloomberg reported, â€œin a two-week span, President Donald Trump ordered up an array of tariffs against numerous countries, blocked Chinese takeovers of U.S. companies and sought new restrictions on future Chinese investmentâ€?.In response, China has decided to enforce new tariffs of 15% and 25% on 128 American goods. While the US is already preparing a second round of tariffs, the Chinese government is only focusing on its response to those that have already gone into effect.The list of items that will be subject to new import taxes upon entry to China include pork, wine, nuts, and certain fruits. â€œThose products make up just a tiny portion of the hundreds of billions of dollars of goods shipped between the two countries each year. But the tariffs are alarming news for the affected industriesâ€?, CNN explained.Trump has justified his tax measures against China by arguing that many jobs have been lost in the US due to unfair practices of the Asian country, such as intellectual property theft. While both countries have already consulted the World Trade Organization (WTO), it is very likely that they will continue using retaliation before the arbiter of international trade disputes makes any important decision.â€œForecasters said they expected the immediate impact of the current American and Chinese measures to be limitedâ€?, according to The Independent. â€œInvestors, however, worry that the global recovery might be set back if other governments respond by raising import barriersâ€?.The US imports more goods from China than any other country in the world. Last year, Americans imported around $505 billion USD worth of goods while only sending $130 USD to China, which means that there is a gap of $375 billion USD. President Donald Trump might be underestimating the economic power of China, and his administration will need to carefully consider their next move. As pointed out by Bloomberg, â€œthe US canÂ´t win a battle against China by itselfâ€?.Latin American Post | Paula BautistaCopy Edited by Susana Cicchetto",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON (AP) â€” If a trade war is coming, the cheesemakers of Wisconsin are standing in the line of fire. So are the farmers of the Great Plains and the distillers of Kentucky. And the employees of iconic American brands like Harley-Davidson and Levi Strauss.The likelihood of a trade conflagration leapt closer to reality this week after the United States imposed tariff on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Infuriated, the jilted U.S. allies vowed to retaliate with tariffs of their own. And in a separate dispute, China is poised to penalize $50 billion in U.S. goods â€” many of them produced by supporters of President Donald Trump in the Americaâ€™s agricultural heartland.â€œTheyâ€™re going to hit the farmers,â€? said Bryan Klabunde, a farmer in northwestern Minnesota. â€œWe want things fair for all industries, but weâ€™re going to take the brunt of the punishment if other countries retaliate.â€™â€?President Donald Trump, who entered office promising to rip up trade deals and crack down on unfair trading practices, is clashing with trading partners on all sides. To the north, heâ€™s battling Canada; to the south, Mexico; to the east, Europe; across the Pacific Ocean to the west, China and Japan.â€œThe president seems to be creating trade (and other) disputes with everyone â€” allies and adversaries alike â€” and itâ€™s difficult to discern any coherent strategy,â€? said Rod Hunter, a former National Security Council staffer under President George W. Bush. â€œThe impacts of the disputes have been limited so far, but the economic and political costs will go up as retaliation by trading partners begins in earnest.â€?Mexico, for instance, plans to retaliate against the steel and aluminum tariffs by targeting U.S. cheese, among other products.â€œItâ€™s our second-largest market,â€? Jeff Schwager, president of Sartori, a cheese company in Plymouth, Wisconsin, said of Mexico. Retaliatory tariffs â€œwill reduce sales â€” thereâ€™s no question.â€?â€œThe hard-earned sales weâ€™ve secured in Mexico could be at risk given the potential for retaliation,â€? the National Milk Producers Federation warned in a statement.The EU is threatening to penalize Kentucky bourbon and the motorcycles of Wisconsin-based Harley-Davidson. The potential tariffs pack a political punch: Theyâ€™d hurt constituents of House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican.On Friday, reporters in Louisville, Kentucky, asked McConnell if he thought the Europeans were trying to get his attention.â€œWell,â€? the Senate leader said, â€œthey got my attention. They didnâ€™t need to do that. These are our friends. These are not enemies. Canada and Mexico, Europe â€” these are our allies, and we need to work this out in a way thatâ€™s comforting to everyone.â€?Harley-Davidson has already absorbed higher steel and aluminum costs since Trump first announced the metals tariffs three months ago. Now, the threats of retaliatory tariffs from abroad raise the fear of higher prices for Harley motorcycles sold outside the U.S.In a statement, Harley-Davidson said retaliatory tariffs â€œwould have a significant impact on our salesâ€? in those countries. The Milwaukee-based company said it was evaluating options for controlling higher materials costs. In April, its chief financial officer warned that cost increases could be worse than the company forecast in January and might last for several quarters.The jeans maker Levi Strauss is also on the EUâ€™s target list.â€œAmerican brands, workers and consumers will ultimately suffer,â€? the San Francisco-based company said in a statement.Ben Steffen, a dairy farmer who also grows corn, soybeans, and wheat on 1,900 acres southeastern Nebraska near Humboldt, is angry about the U.S. tariffs being imposed on Americaâ€™s closest trade partners and allies.â€œIâ€™m upset because it hits me in my pocketbook from multiple angles,â€? he said. â€œI sell beef, I sell corn, I sell soybeans and I sell milk. All of those products are vulnerable because we export significant amounts in those markets.â€?The milk market has been depressed for about three years, and farmers have struggled to break even. About 14 percent of U.S. milk production is exported; the largest customer is Mexico.â€œThis is the worst possible thing to have for our milk market, and itâ€™s the same for every other commodity,â€? Steffen said. â€? These are important relationships.â€?In Stockton, California, Jeff Colombini is worried about the financial damage a trade war would bring to his 1,800-acre farm. His company, Lodi Farming, exports walnuts, cherries and apples to Mexico, Canada, the European Union and other countries.â€œWith these tariffs, itâ€™s going to make the product too expensive for the consumers in Mexico and in Canada and in the EU,â€? Colombini said. â€œWeâ€™re not going to be able to sell all of our crop. And so some of it is probably going to go unharvested or just dumped â€¦ I have 200 employees, and they depend on the success of this operation for their jobs to feed and clothe their families.â€?A trade fight with the Europe would also cause collateral damage across the Atlantic. Steelworkers in Port Talbot, Wales, who have struggled to protect their factory and 4,000 jobs, now face another threat.Union leader Mark Turner said workers are trying to sort out what the tariffs will mean for Port Talbot. But they feel â€œeverything is against us,â€? particularly given Britainâ€™s economic uncertainty as the country prepares to leave the European Union.â€œWe will keep fighting,â€? Turner said. â€œIf we canâ€™t go into the American market, then thereâ€™s other markets out there we will try and get into.An even higher-stakes trade dispute is playing out on the Pacific Rim. The United States and China are poised to impose tariffs on up to $200 billion worth of each otherâ€™s goods in a battle over Beijingâ€™s strong-arm efforts to overtake U.S. technological supremacy.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is traveling to Beijing this weekend for talks aimed at preventing an all-out trade war between the worldâ€™s two biggest economies. On the Chinese target list are American soybean farmers, who send about 60 percent of their exports to China.On Friday, Klabunde, who grows corn and soybeans on 3,000 acres near Waubun, Minnesota, spent two nerve-wracking hours with a hired hand, pulling a stuck tractor out of a drainage ditch. They finally got the machine free.â€œI think the tariffs and trade war scare me more than a stuck planter,â€? Klabunde said. â€œI can lose only so much money on a stuck planter. I can lose a lot more money in a trade war.â€?___Karnowski reported from Minneapolis___AP staffers Terry Chea in Stockton, California; Carrie Antlfinger in Plymouth, Wisconsin; Bruce Schreiner in Louisville, Kentucky; David Pitt in Des Moines, Iowa; Anne Dâ€™Innocenzio and Candice Choi in New York; David Koenig in Dallas; and Danica Kirka in London contributed to this report.Jeff Colombini looks over bing cherries in one of his orchards in Friday, June 1, 2018, in Stockton, Calif.

"Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma. Photo: BloombergHong Kong: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. co-founder Jack Ma said his promise to create 1 million jobs in the US is impossible to fulfill because of the US-China trade war, a setback in one high-profile effort for deeper cooperation between the worldâ€™s two largest economies.Ma, Chinaâ€™s richest man, made the remarks in an interview in the state-owned Xinhua news service, saying the pledge made to US President Donald Trump is no longer feasible because of the unstable trade situation.Ma and Trump met in January 2017 to discuss how adding small and medium-sized US businesses to Alibabaâ€™s platform would boost employment.Ma has grown increasingly critical of the trade battle between the US and China, warning that it will damage businesses around the world. On Tuesday, he cautioned Chinaâ€™s business and political leaders to prepare for the conflict to last 20 years, beyond the Trump presidency, as the two countries battle for economic supremacy.â€œThe promise was made based on China and the US having a collaborative and friendly relationship,â€? he said in the Xinhua interview. â€œThe situation now has completely destroyed our premise, so it can no longer be completed.â€?Ma also said in the interview that he will keep making efforts to push for the healthy development of bilateral trade ties. He said that trade is not a weapon and shouldnâ€™t be used for wars.On Thursday, Ma said weakness in the economic outlook is â€œproblematicâ€? for the company.â€œThe economic outlook is not perfect of course, and it will last longer than people expect,â€? Ma said at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin. â€œIf you look at the government conference papers, every year they say we have complex problems in the economy.â€?Tensions have escalated this week as China vowed to retaliate against U.S. plans to levy tariffs on about $200 billion in Chinese goods. China said it will impose retaliatory tariffs against $60 billion of U.S. goods, ranging from meat to wheat and textiles.â€œShort term, business communities in China, US, Europe will all be in trouble,â€? Ma said on Tuesday, during a speech at Alibabaâ€™s investor day in Hangzhou. â€œThis thing will last long.

"US National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow said they still have time work out their differences. Photo: ReutersWashington: The US and China indicated theyâ€™re willing to negotiate on escalating frictions, helping to ease fears among investors that a tit-for-tat trade dispute could derail the strongest global expansion in years.The White Houseâ€™s National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow spent much of the day Wednesday trying to calm markets after the two countries announced tariffs, and said they still have time work out their differences.â€œRemember, none of the tariffs have been put in place yet. These are all proposals,â€? he said in a brief interview, without specifying if talks are planned or how theyâ€™d take place. â€œWeâ€™re putting it out for comment. Thereâ€™s at least two months before any actions are taken. China by the way did not enact the tariffs.â€?Chinaâ€™s ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, also said his first choice would be to consult the US over trade. â€œNegotiations would still be our preference, but it takes two to tango,â€? he said. â€œWeâ€™ll always stand for consultation and negotiation, but if others do things in the wrong direction, weâ€™ll have to respond.â€?The comments came after China early on Wednesday said it would levy an additional 25% tariff on about $50 billion of US imports. The move matched the scale of proposed US tariffs announced the previous day. The US is allowing 60 days for public feedback and hasnâ€™t specified when the tariffs would take effect, leaving a window open for talks.US stocks opened sharply lower on Wednesday, but reversed course and ended the day higher as investors speculated the spat wouldnâ€™t spiral out of control.President Donald Trump also downplayed the skirmish, saying on Twitter that â€œwe are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the US.â€?Trump also tweeted that â€œwhen youâ€™re already $500 Billion DOWN, you canâ€™t lose,â€? in a possible reference to Americaâ€™s trade deficit with China. Figures from the US Commerce Department put last yearâ€™s trade gap with the Asian nation at $337 billion.The Trump administrationâ€™s latest offensive is a response to alleged infringements of intellectual property in China. The US is targeting high-tech sectors that Beijing sees as the future for its economy.While the China retaliation was more â€œbelligerentâ€? than expected, Beijing probably wants to de-escalate tensions by underscoring whatâ€™s at stake for both sides, Oxford Economics director of global macro strategy, Gaurav Saroliya, said in a research note. â€œNegotiations will probably lead to less disruptive outcomes for both sides,â€? Saroliya wrote.In a statement following the US release of details on its China tariffs, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration â€œwill continue to engage in discussions with China to address these issues of reciprocal trade.â€?Beijingâ€™s proposed targets strike at the core of commercial relations between the two countries, and at some of the most politically sensitive goods in core Trump constituencies. For example, China is the worldâ€™s largest soybean importer and biggest buyer of US soybeans in trade worth about $14 billion last year. Farming states were also among Trumpâ€™s staunchest supports in the election.The implementation of Chinaâ€™s tariffs depends on the outcome of bilateral negotiations, as well as US decisions, deputy finance minister Zhu Guangyao told reporters after a news conference in Beijing. â€œWe believe both countries have the ability and wisdom to address the problem,â€? Zhu said.Stocks to watch after Trump announces proposed China tariffsIndustries including aerospace, information and communications technology, robotics and machinery were among those targeted by the US Trade Representative on Tuesday. The agency said it chose products to minimize the impact on the US economy and consumers.In addition to advanced technologies such as communication satellites, the US list includes items ranging from various types of steel to television components, medical devices, dishwashers, snow blowers and even flame throwers. The 25% tariffs come on top of any existing levies.â€œThe US list suggests that the government is targeting the â€˜Made in China 2025â€™ initiative, while Chinaâ€™s retaliation intends to bring Americans back to the negotiation table,â€? Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore, said in an email.Chinaâ€™s Made in China 2025 plan was announced in 2015, and highlighted 10 sectors for support on the way to China becoming an advanced manufacturing power, from information technology to robotics and aerospace. China also has a separate development strategy for artificial intelligence, published last year.â€œThe current tariff measures from both parties are very unlikely to be implemented,â€? said Ren Qing, a partner at Global Law in Beijing who has advised the Chinese government on its response to the intellectual-property investigation. â€œPeople from American industries may exert pressure on the US government and influence final policy implementation.â€?

"Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump. Photo: ReutersGeneva: The Donald Trump administration is preparing grounds for an all-out trade war with China by slapping unilateral crowbar tariffs on more than $500 billion of Chinese goods despite mounting opposition from American companies, analysts said. US President Donald Trump on Friday signalled his intention to impose tariffs on additional $267 billion, in addition to the proposed 25% duty to be levied on $200 billion of Chinese goods. â€œThe $200 billion weâ€™re talking about could take place very soon, depending what happens with them. To a certain extent, itâ€™s going to be up to China,â€? President Trump told reporters on Air Force One.The US has already imposed additional tariffs of 25% on $50 billion of Chinese goods on 23 August under Section 301 on grounds of alleged theft of American intellectual property rights and forced transfer of technology from US companies by China. With additional tariffs on the proposed $200 billion Chinese goods, the total IPR (intellectual property rights)-related tariffs on Chinese goods will go up to $250 billion.The administration is currently struggling to finalize the list of Chinese goods of $200 billion that would be subjected with additional tariffs because of opposition from American businesses.Many US companies making bicycles to laptops and mobile phones, including Apple Inc., are seeking exemptions from the proposed tariffs on $200 billion Chinese goods, while cautioning that the tariffs will adversely hit Americaâ€™s economic interests.In a joint letter issued to the US Trade Representative ambassador Robert Lighthizer last week, many US business and industry lobby groups warned that â€œcontinuing the tit-for-tat tariff escalation with China only serves to expand the harm to more US economic interests, including farmers, families, business and workers.â€? â€œUnilaterally imposing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in goods invites retaliation and has not resulted in meaningful negotiations and concessions,â€? they warned, Financial Times reported on 7 September.But President Trump and China hawks in his administration such as Peter Kent Navarro, director of White House National Trade Council, and USTR ambassador Lighthizer reckon their actions against China are essential to stop China in its tracks from causing damage to the future of American high-tech industries. â€œI hate to say that (the proposed 25% tariffs on $200 billion Chinese goods), there is another $267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want. That totally changes the equation,â€? the President said on Friday. â€œIâ€™m being strong on China because I have to be,â€? Trump said.In response to American actions, China chose to retaliate against what it called the unilateral actions of the Trump administration on a balanced and measure-for-measure basis. Until now, China has hit back with retaliatory tariffs on a vast range of American products, including soybeans and beef, against each American action that began with solar panels and large residential washing machines followed by steel and aluminium and now IPR-related tariffs.Significantly, Trump left none of his close trade allies such as Mexico, Canada, the European Union (EU) and Japan in doubt that he is going to retaliate against them if they fail to satisfy US trade concerns. EU has not only provided additional market access for American agricultural products but is also willing to consider bringing its auto tariffs, particularly on cars, to zero.Canada is waging a grim rearguard battle in ongoing negotiations to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to ensure its core concerns for preserving Chapter 19 binding dispute resolution mechanism, the dairy management board, and existing intellectual property protections for new drugs called biologics. It remains to be seen whether Canadaâ€™s prime minister Justin Trudeau who said a no deal is better than a bad deal with the US in the NAFTA-revamp negotiations will be able to safeguard his countryâ€™s interests.Japan, which is hit with steel and aluminium duties, is watching what President Trump would do on auto tariffs under the Section 232 national security provisions. â€œIf the Trump administration goes ahead to impose additional tariffs on cars and other auto products, Japan will retaliate,â€? said a trade official from Japan, who asked not to be identified.Notwithstanding Trumpâ€™s trade war with China, the EU, Japan, Canada, and other western countries are eager to make a joint alliance with the US for crafting new trade disciplines and rules to stop China from providing subsidies and other supports to its industry even under legitimate World Trade Organization rules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The inside of a ZTE smart phone is pictured in this illustration taken April 17, 2018. ? Reuters picBEIJING, April 20 ? China has long pushed the development of top-end semiconductors as a key strategic objective.Now, as a trade war with the United States looms, a government decision to accelerate the development of the domestic chip industry underlines how far those goals have fallen short.Senior Chinese officials are increasingly concerned about stalling efforts to improve domestic chip design, seen as critical after a series of failed outbound deals, according to two industry insiders familiar with the matter.Closing the quality gap with US chipmakers has become a matter of urgency in Beijing.Senior government officials met this week to discuss how to speed up chip development in light of brewing trade tensions with the United States, Reuters reported yesterday.China has made chip development a key plank of its Made in China 2025 drive to bolster its strength in technology against more developed rivals in the United States, Japan and Europe. The government wants local chips to make up at least 40 per cent of China's semiconductor needs by the middle of the next decade.However, Chinese chipmakers are struggling to hit key targets, industry insiders say.Domestic chipmakers have been stymied by the blocking of a series of chip-related deals overseas, and are having trouble attracting talent and overcoming technical hurdles in developing higher-end domestic chips.A Chinese deal for the US semiconductor testing company Xcerra Corp was shot down by a US national security panel in February, while the US$1.3 billion (RM5.06 billion) acquisition of the US chipmaker Lattice Semiconductor Corp was blocked last year.â€œThere was earlier a belief that the technology would be easier to develop, or that it could be acquired from overseas,â€? said a supplier to one of China's top state-backed integrated circuit chip firms. â€œNow we're seeing that it's not the case.â€?â€œThe projects are efficient and there is a lot of funding support,â€? the person added, but â€œthere are more problems to solve than they initially thought.â€?These delays came into sharp relief this week after the United States imposed a seven-year ban on sales by American companies to the Chinese phone maker ZTE Corp ? a move that threatens to cut off its supply chain.ZTE, which relies heavily on US chips, said today the ban was unfair and threatened its survival.Interviews with half a dozen China chip suppliers, business groups, investors, and analysts suggest that despite heavy investment and rhetoric, China is behind schedule in developing high-end chips, or integrated circuits. China has made more progress on lower-end chips, people said.â€œThe reason why chip technology has experienced such limited progress despite years of advocacy is that the Chinese system has not yet formed a key driving force for it,â€? China's Global Times newspaper said in an editorial today.The country's leaders, rattled by the trade frictions with the United States and the ZTE case, are now looking to double down on investment into research and development of domestically-designed chips, the two people said.The state-backed National Integrated Circuit Investment Fund will step up spending on domestic chip design versus other areas such as financing overseas deals, the people added.The â€œBig Fundâ€?, which closed a new round of funding worth an estimated US$32 billion last month, will dedicate around a quarter of the new funds to integrated circuit design, they added.One design challenge faced by Chinese companies is catching up in a short timeframe with rivals who have been developing increasingly complex technology for decades.China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the National Integrated Circuit Investment Fund did not respond to faxed requests for comment today.US regulators have cracked down on acquisitions of overseas semiconductor assets by Chinese state-backed companies ? an effort spanning the Obama and Trump administrations ? over fears that Beijing's state-subsidized efforts would undermine US supremacy in semiconductor technology.China says the aggressive policy is needed to reduce dependence on foreign-made chips. China imported US$227 billion worth of integrated circuits in 2016, more than for imports of crude oil, iron ore and primary plastics combined.These chips go into smartphones, computers and other electronic devices, as well as high-end industrial and military products.Beijing is now seeking to relieve pressure on priority chip products by cutting corporate taxes for up to five years, officials said this month. Companies are also spending heavily to tap foreign resources as well as engineers from overseas competitors, analysts say.â€œIt's not uncommon for engineers to get a salary that is five times what they are paid in Korea or Taiwan if they work in China,â€? said a Korean chip engineer who now works in China with the domestic semiconductor industry.â€œThe bonuses are largeâ€? and if you can recruit others â€œthere are very big incentives,â€? the person said. He declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.Jeter Teo, Taipei-based research director at the tech analytics consultancy Trendforce, said China was aggressively looking to attract talent, though still had less than half the 700,000 semiconductor experts it needed to really compete.While China has managed to attract many experts in the semiconductor field, analysts say, others are deterred by clauses in some contracts limiting job mobility and the challenges of moving families to China.â€œThere is no doubt companies will catch up eventually,â€? the Chinese chip supplier source said, referring to Chinese firms.But â€œthey must develop at double the speed of overseas companies, otherwise they will always be a generation behind,â€? the source said. ?

"In China, concern has reached such a level that authorities on Monday unveiled a package of policies to boost domestic demand to cushion the economy from the fallout from the trade dispute. â€” Reuters picFRANKFURT, July 25 â€” Protectionism is slowly starting to weigh on the global economy.From demand at factories to company profits and prices consumers are paying, the tit-for-tat trade battle US President Donald Trump started with China and the European Union is starting to show up in numbers. And itâ€™s still early days, with Trump saying yesterday that â€œtariffs are the greatest,â€? a warning that he may not let up until he gets what he wants.The latest signs of the fallout came in activity reports from Japan, Europe and the US, as well as anxious words from companies facing an additional uncertainty and having to decide between taking a hit to their profit margins or jacking up prices. Many manufacturers are also facing higher raw-material costs, another squeeze on earnings.Harley-Davidson Inc yesterday cut its profit margin forecast, citing tariffs. The iconic motorcycle maker was caught in the crossfire of the trade war last month when it announced plans to shift some US production overseas, prompting attacks from Trump.Dutch electronics firm Royal Philips NV Chief Executive Frans van Houten says an escalation of tariffs may mean it has to pass on costs to customers, and Whirlpool Corp said rising raw material costs hurt results in some of its markets in the second quarter.For the global economy, which was enjoying its best spell in years, thereâ€™s a sense that the period of synchronised global growth is at an end. The US has got a temporary shot in the arm from tax cuts, but growth is cooling in China, a number of emerging markets are dealing with a currency sell-off, and Europe has been slow to recover from a winter-battered start to the year.According to Abby Joseph Cohen, advisory director at Goldman Sachs, global growth will continue into 2019, but itâ€™s moving into a slower phase. A trade war on top of that would be a further weight.â€˜Very uncomfortableâ€™â€œWhat is so hard to quantify is the impact not just on demand but on costs and on supply-chain disruption,â€? she said on Bloomberg Television. â€œWhat we have now are anecdotes more than anything but this is what we need to be watching. Clearly if there were an all-out trade war, it would be very difficult for investors to focus very directly just on the fundamentals, the geopolitical environment would be very uncomfortable.â€?In the 19-nation euro area, IHS Markitâ€™s monthly survey showed growth softened in July on weaker new orders and deteriorating confidence. Factory activity in Japan grew at the weakest pace since 2016 and, in the UK, where Brexit is another complication, manufacturing output expectations weakened, as have investment intentions.The Markit reports come just days after central bankers and finance ministers from the Group of 20 economies said that trade tensions are threatening global growth, echoing multiple warnings from around the world.In China, concern has reached such a level that authorities on Monday unveiled a package of policies to boost domestic demand to cushion the economy from the fallout from the trade dispute.The euro-area composite Purchasing Managers Index for manufacturing and services fell to 54.3 from 54.9 in June, a sharper drop than economists had forecast. A measure of expectations fell to a 20-month low.â€œGiven the waning growth of new business and further slide in business optimism, the outlook has also deteriorated,â€? said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at Markit. For manufacturers, the survey saw trade worries â€œintensify markedly,â€? he said.The pressure on the economy may only be beginning, and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is traveling to Washington this week in an effort to ease tensions. He wonâ€™t come unarmed. The EU has vowed to retaliate against any import duties, and China has also said it will match American sanctions on its exports.In the US, the PMI report showed continued growth in private-sector activity, but a second straight drop in goods export orders. There was also a record surge in prices charged and more supply-chain delays.â€œTrade frictions have clearly become a major cause of concern, especially among manufacturers,â€? Williamson said. â€œFirms have become increasingly worried about the impact of tariff and trade wars on demand, prices and supply chains. â€” Bloomberg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Volvo, which has been owned by Chinese construction giant Geely Holding Group Co. since 2010, had planned to go public by the end of this year. â€” Photo courtesy of Sisma AutoPARIS, Sept 11 â€” Auto giant Volvo has fallen prey to growing concerns over the USâ€™ rumbling trade war with China, and has had to postpone plans for a share sale, the groupâ€™s CEO told Bloomberg yesterday.Volvo, which has been owned by Chinese construction giant Geely Holding Group Co. since 2010, had planned to go public by the end of this year.However, the auto behemoth has had to backtrack on the plans, citing fears over mounting tensions sparked by the US-China trade conflict.â€œThe issues around trade are hard for us because they impact cars shipped between China and the US,â€? said chief executive Hakan Samuelsson of the Swedish company.â€œItâ€™s a huge drawback,â€? Samuelsson told Bloomberg News. â€œThe risk is that these headwinds will increase.â€?In 2017, Volvoâ€™s sales in China were 25.8 per cent higher than a year earlier, with over 114,000 vehicles sold.The company, which exports vehicles from units in China to the United States, had planned to do the reverse from a plant in South Carolina.However, because of the trade war, Volvo has had to backtrack on that plan, Bloomberg said.US President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to slap tariffs on all of the Chinese goods imported into the US, ramping up the already tense trade relations with Beijing amid ongoing talks with Canada and the EU.The United States already has punitive tariffs on US$50 billion (RM207.4 billion) in Chinese goods in place and another US$200 billion are â€œin the hopperâ€? and â€œcould take place very soon,â€? Trump said.He also told reporters that â€œbehind that, thereâ€™s another US$267 billion ready to go on short notice if I wantâ€?.That would cover virtually all the goods imported from the worldâ€™s second largest economy. â€” AFP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US-China trade war worsenshome/News/World/US-China trade war worsensOVER the weekend, the US-China trade war turned worse as President Donald Trump linked it directly to the continued North Korean nuclear development programâ€”despite the UN sanctions for violating the international reduction of nuclear armamentsâ€”and indirectly accused Beijing of using it as a weapon in their trade war.In international news service reports from Washington, Trumped stopped the scheduled fourth trip of US State Secretary Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang for another round of denuclearization and peace negotiations with his counterpart until the US-China â€œâ€¦trading relationship is resolved.â€?This latest geopolitical development came after the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna reported that the â€œcontinued and farther development of the Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Koreaâ€™s (DPRP) nuclear program and related statements by the DPRK are a cause for grave concern.â€?The Washington reports attributed to the White House spokesperson quoted Trump as saying â€œâ€¦additionally, because of our much tougher trading stance with China, I donâ€™t believe they (China) are helping the process of (North Korean) denuclearization as they once were (despite the UN sanctions which are in place).â€?Of course, and naturally, China denies this and claims in its domestic and international propaganda/â€œinformation campaignâ€? that its foreign policy is designed for global â€œcooperation and peace.â€? But it totally ignores world criticism of its military buildup in man-made atolls and reefs in the international waters of the disputed South China Sea region.Beijing has anchored its foreign policy on the One Belt One Road (OBOR) technical and financial assistance offered to the worldâ€™s developing economies. Its aim is to directly link Chinaâ€™s sources of raw materials to its factories to turnout cheapâ€”but inferior qualityâ€”products for its manufacturing-exporting hybrid economy.The reports appear to be the first open admission by the White House, though in not so many words, in published reports that China has been usingâ€”and assistingâ€”North Koreaâ€™s continued development of a miniature nuclear rocket capable of hitting American mainland cities, as a tool of Beijing in the ambition to be the worldâ€™s top superpower in his century.This can mean one sure immediate future development: the fallout of the trade war will be harsher on underdeveloped or developing economies of the world, including the Asean member nations, and close neighbors of China, especially when and if a currency crises follow.Researchers of government think-tanks and academic scholars can easily trace the consequences of the 1997 Asian financial crises, and the history of economic recessions since the late 1920s that led to World War 2 in 1939 through the geopolitical evolutions for lessons learned.Hopefully, last weekâ€™s Beijing visit of Malaysian Prime Minister Mohammad Mahathir and the warning statement of President Rodrigo Duterte on the West Philippine Sea explorations are the start of a unified Asean action on Chinaâ€™s OBOR projects.Mahathir scrapped the $22-billion OBOR project deal with China because it would drive Malaysia into a debt trap Kuala Lumpur could not pay. He was trying to renegotiate the agreement but President Xi Jinping obviously was not responsive that he had to cancel it. Mahathir said repaying Malaysiaâ€™s debts was his regimeâ€™s priority now, not the railway and pipeline projects.The Malaysian statement issued in Beijing at the end of his visit said 88 percent of the cost of the two oil pipelines in Sabah and Kedah had already been â€œpaid to the Chinese contractor despite only 13 percent [being] completed.â€?Duterte warned Chinaâ€”after repeated Chinese warnings against Philippine military supply ships and planes delivering provisions to small Filipino communities in the West Philippine Seaâ€”against exploring, and extracting, for oil and uranium in the area to avoid war. Besides, the Philippines does not pose a threat to China in any way.He said â€œthere will be trouble if China grabs for oil and uraniumâ€¦â€? in the area.These developments gain more importance because next month is the start of the negotiations to finalize the draft of the Code of Conduct (COC), in the South China Sea, the basis of a working agreement between China and the 10 individual Asean members as to how conflicts in the SCS will be resolved.China has been delaying the negotiation for the last 15 years and does not want to sign any agreement with Asean as a group but as individual sovereign nation-states.International geopolitical and economic analysts have warned against the OBOR offers of Beijing because of the danger of debt trap; huge financial and technical assistance could force the recipient economies into more national financial loans they can repay on the basis of a 50-year (or more) timeline only.Now that China is internationally recognized as an â€œeconomic miracleâ€? and a superpower, it is relevant for the Asean 10 to intensify their studies and research on how China uses all available instruments of diplomacyâ€”to win friends and influence peopleâ€”for its own national interest, aligned with or diametrically opposite ours.This is imperative now, world history shows us, because of the dynamics of evolution and in this the information communication technology age. And whatever happens to the superpowers will certainly affect us all.China is currently intensifying its drive to convince small countries still closely allied (and trading) with Taiwan although they recognize mainland China or the Peopleâ€™s Republic.Take the case of Palau, a small South Pacific Island state about 500 miles east of Mindanao. Beijing banned Chinese tourists to Palau claiming it is an â€œillegal destinationâ€? for â€œlack of diplomatic statusâ€? (it is not yet a fully independent sovereign member country of the UN). China wants Palau to accept mainland China tourists onlyâ€”a pressure it has been putting on Palau to formally acknowledge Taiwan as a province of China under Beijingâ€™s one-China policy.Palau is unmoved and sticks to Taiwan as a close traditional ally and trading partner.Or Sri Lanka, which reportedly agreed to its OBOR railway project with Beijing payable in 99 years. Now China wants a naval base instead and is reportedly putting pressure on Colombo to agree.Or Djibouti by the southeast entrance to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal from the Arabian Sea, where the Chinaâ€™s Peopleâ€™s Liberation Armyâ€”the worldâ€™s largest armed forcesâ€”now has its first naval base outside its sovereign territory.Beijing wants naval bases and roads to prevent rival economies â€“and this is primarily the US and its allies, which it believes are dedicated to prevent China from succeeding on her â€œpredestination in this centuryâ€?â€”from controlling choke points in the high seas to have sustained raw supplies for energy and the Chinese factories.Aseans must be always on the alert for any negative developments in the domestic politics of the superpowers to strategically anticipate and choose their individual and collective options to survive any backlash or war. Because while nobody wants a world war, it is not automatically erased as a possibility in the present environment.Comments and reactions to gilsmanilatimes@yahoo.com.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"news, nationalAustralia is fighting to keep global trade doors open as the protectionist battles between the United States and China push other countries to commit to free trade. The two superpowers are raising tariffs on each other, but Trade Minister Steve Ciobo is buoyed by the way other countries have re-committed to free trade. 'There's been a reaction to that in other quarters, that says 'we're going to double down in terms of liberalising market access',' he told ABC radio on Wednesday. 'That's presenting a rich vein for Australia.' Treasurer Scott Morrison says he will take up the push for more free trade at the G20 finance ministers meeting in Argentina this weekend. 'We have been fighting to keep the doors open to trade. That's good for Australia,' he told reporters in Tasmania. 'No-one wins from a trade war. And we need to ensure that we continue to provide the leadership and the advocacy for trade that prevents economic self-harm being done to the global economy.' Mr Ciobo, who is in London, also says Australia has to be 'realistic' about the kind of free trade deal it can do with the United Kingdom if it stays in the European Union's customs union. The UK is negotiating with European leaders about leaving the EU, but the finer details of how it happens have implications for Australia's plans for a deal. Australia will have to wait to see what gets decided before it can pursue a free trade agreement with the UK, the minister said. 'I think we need to be realistic. It is perfectly understandable that the UK is going to seek to do the best deal that they can with the EU,' he said. 'It's a massive market right on their door step, and realistically that is going to preoccupy their focus and attention. 'Once they work out ultimately what that shape will be, that is when Australia can engage in a substantive way.'

"The United States is â€œopening fireâ€? on the world with its threatened tariffs, China warned on Thursday, saying no one wants a trade war but it will respond the instant U.S. measures go into effect, as Beijing ramped up the rhetoric in the heated dispute.The Trump administrationâ€™s tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports are due to go into effect at 0401 GMT on Friday, which is just after midday in Beijing.U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to escalate the trade conflict with tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods if China retaliates, with the row roiling financial markets including stocks, currencies and the global trade of commodities from soybeans to coal.China has said it will not â€œfire the first shotâ€?, but its customs agency made clear on Thursday that Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods would take effect immediately after U.S. duties on Chinese goods kick in.via ReutersThis article is for general information purposes only.

"After $100 billion in taxes imposed on both sides this summer, Washington is preparing new measures on $200 billion in imports from China.However, the Trump administration has invited again Chinese officials to restart trade talks, the White House's top economic adviser said on Wednesday.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters today that China welcomed the invitation, and the two countries were discussing the details.'China has always held that an escalation of the trade conflict is not in anyone's interests. In fact, from last month's preliminary talks in Washington, the two sides' trade talk teams have maintained various forms of contact, and held discussions on the concerns of each side,' he said.A strategic antagonismBut progress towards an agreement remain to be seen. Behind the trade opposition, there is a deeper, strategic antagonism: that of two powers with a hegemonic ambition. It is very possible that the two sides won't agree in the end.In fact, Barclays has just amended its scenario on the consequences of the Sino-American trade war and is more pessimistic than average. Its basic assumption is that the United States will overtax all Chinese products by 20% and that Beijing will respond in identical terms.'The US has security concerns about China?s industrial policy, while China sees policies such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Made in China 2025 as necessary to avoid the ?middle income trap.? These conflicting goals could mean the relationship between the US and China becomes more confrontational over time,' the bank said in a report.However, Barclays said the permanent impact would only be 0.2 to 0.4% of GDP over time, and rather 0.2% for the United States. This is also one of the reasons why Barclays thinks that the U.S and China will keep their hard line.(Source : Barclays study 'China US tensions, when giants collide')(Source : Barclays study 'China US tensions, when giants collide')However it is also planning for a worst case scenario : ' In an alternative US isolationism scenario, where the US increases tariffs on all imports by 20pp and all trading partners respond in kind, we estimate permanent economic losses in the US at about 1.5% of GDP. Since the US is at the center of the protectionist regime shift, it may incur a greater decline in trade volume than its trading partners. We estimate losses in China of about 1.0% of GDP.'And in the end the bank believe that the consumer will end up paying the price. 'Losses to consumers, who end up paying higher prices for many goods, are likely to be several times larger than net economic costs to the economy as a whole. In our baseline US-China scenario, we estimate plausible losses to US consumers at about 0.6% of GDP, only some of which is transferred to the government and corporate sector in the form of tariff revenues and profitability.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"By Engen ThamSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese state media kept up their criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies, with a newspaper on Tuesday describing as 'wishful thinking' Trump's belief that a fall in Chinese stocks was a sign of his winning the trade war.As the world's two biggest economies remained locked in a heated tariff dispute, Beijing and Washington have kept up a blistering rhetoric with threats and counter-threats of more punitive trade measures.The editorial in the official China Daily underscored an increasingly aggressive stance adopted by Chinese state media against Trump, a shift from their previous approach of tempering any direct criticism against the U.S. president.On Monday, the overseas edition of the Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper singled out Trump, saying he was starring in his own 'street fighter-style deceitful drama of extortion and intimidation'.China proposed retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods ranging from liquefied natural gas (LNG) to some aircraft on Friday, following the Trump administration's plan for a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.The China Daily referred to a Saturday Tweet by Trump which said 'Tariffs are working far better than anyone anticipated. China market has dropped 27 percent in last four months.'China's stock market was performing poorly before the U.S. administration imposed tariffs, said the English-language newspaper, asserting that the downturn was partly due to Beijing's attempts to cut corporate debt.The paper said Trump's claim that 'tariffs are working big time' was undermined by data showing the U.S. trade deficit climbed $3 billion to $46.3 billion in June, the first increase in four months.The China Daily is often used by the government to communicate its message to an international audience.Trump has repeatedly criticized China for its trade deficit with the United States, saying it showed Beijing was engaging in unfair trade practices.Chinese state media has also been promoting the message that the country's economy is strong enough to ride out the trade war.In a separate commentary, in the People's Daily overseas edition, a researcher at the Commerce Ministry reiterated this stance, saying China was strong and resilient enough to weather the trade dispute.'We absolutely have reason to believe that during this complex trade friction, and relying on the domestic market, China can continue to enhance its leading position in the global economic and industrial system,' researcher Mei Xinyu wrote.Despite the U.S. tariffs, a Reuters poll of economists forecast China's exports to have grown in July, though many see a deteriorating outlook for shipments especially if Trump goes ahead with his threats to slap more punitive duties on Chinese importsRecent data showed growth in the world's second largest economy has already started to cool. The government has responded by releasing more liquidity into the banking system, encouraging lending and promising a more 'active' fiscal policy.(Reporting by Engen Tham; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in Beijing; Editing by Sam Holmes & Shri Navaratnam)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"click to enlarge Photo by Jeffrey Sauger for General MotorsGeneral Motors CEO Mary Barra.President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports could hurt a one-time Trump ally: General Motors.On Tuesday, Trump announced more tariffs on Chinese products, including a 25-percent tariff on Chinese-made automobiles. The move, however, wouldn't harm China's domestic auto companies because they don't sell very many cars in North America.General Motors, however, does produce two models it manufactures in China and imports to the U.S. â€” the Cadillac CT6 Plug-In Hybrid and the Buick Envision crossover.The moves prompted GM to issue a response on Wednesday that seemed to call on Trump to reconsider, at least as far as antiseptic corporate statements go.'We continue to believe both countries value a vibrant auto industry and understand the interdependence between the worldâ€™s two largest automotive markets,' the company said in a statement . 'We support a positive trade relationship between the US and China, and urge both countries to continue to engage in constructive dialogue and pursue sustainable trade policies.'Trump's tariffs on Chinese products join earlier tariffs announced in March on steel and aluminum imports â€” a move that others argued would harm the auto industry, which already saw slipping sales following a historic high in 2016. The tariffs on steel and aluminum alone could add $200 to $300 to the price of an American-made vehicle.'These proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports couldnâ€™t come at a worse time,' Cody Lusk, president of the American International Automobile Dealers Association, said in March . 'Auto sales have flattened in recent months, and manufacturers are not prepared to absorb a sharp increase in the cost to build cars and trucks in America.'In response, China said it would place retaliatory tariffs on $50 billion of American products, including automobiles. However, at least one business analyst thinks the Chinese tariffs would have a low impact on GM, since the company manufactures most of the cars it sells in China there. 'I don't see them as being susceptible to the tariffs,' Cox Automotive senior economist Charlie Chesbrough told. 'There will be no impact directly because [GM is] not doing volumes like Tesla or Ford.'Still, it's the latest in what has been a tumultuous relationship between GM and Trump. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly threatened to hit Detroit auto companies with a tariff on Mexican-made cars.'General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border,' Trump tweeted shortly before taking office in 2017. 'Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!' (The company responded that this was inaccurate â€” that the majority of its Cruze models are made in Ohio, and most of the Mexican-made Cruzes are sold outside of the U.S.)Once Trump took office, he appeared to promise an auspicious reset with the Big Three, inviting its CEOs to the White House on his first week on the job. Trump also invited GM CEO Mary Barra to join his Strategic and Policy Forum.The good vibes didn't last long, though. In June of 2017, Trump (figuratively) ripped up the Paris climate treaty. This happened to be on the same day GM released its annual sustainability report, in which Barra said, 'Environmental stewardship and sustainability are part of our business model and core to our operations.'That again caused the company to issue a statement in the general direction of Trump. 'GM will not waver from our commitment to the environment and our position on climate change has not changed,' the company said. 'International agreements aside, we remain committed to creating a better environment.'Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum was disbanded in August of that year, after a number of CEOs resigned in protest of Trump's response to the white supremacists in Charlottesville. It was unclear why the Forum disbanded, though Barra's statement at the time suggested the true cause:'General Motors is about unity and inclusion and so am I,' she said. 'Recent events, particularly those in Charlottesville, Virginia, and its aftermath, require that we come together as a country and reinforce values and ideals that unite us â€” tolerance, inclusion, and diversity â€” and speak against those which divide us â€” racism, bigotry, and any politics based on ethnicity.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is also the consensus of the BRICS countries,' Hua said.Beijing and Washington have slapped levies of $34 billion on each other's products, a move which was initiated by Trump whose administration accuses China of unfair trade practices.Trump has also slapped additional tariffs on products from the European Union, which he called a 'foe' last week.Catch up on all the latest Crime, National, International and Hatke news here.

In recent months, the $165 sale price Boerboom was getting for a pig has dropped to the $145 range, thanks in part to new tariffs China and Mexico have placed on pork products, in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on products like steel and aluminum.The falling price of pork is worrisome for pig farmers in Minnesota, one of the biggest swine-producing states in the U.S. And things are not looking up: Futures, prices predictions about where prices will go in the coming months, suggest a drop to around $120 per head by December, Boerboom said.New tariffsThe U.S. pork industry had been experiencing some fat years recently, with production ramping up. Pork producers had it good. Different markets have developed tastes for different cuts of meat: China takes pork belly and picnic (the lower shoulder), and Mexico takes the hams, Boerboom said. In the U.S., people are big eaters of pork shoulder and bacon, which comes from the belly.â€œEvery country and everybody wants something different when you break the pig down,â€? he said.Then came the tariffs, a response to President Donald Trumpâ€™s efforts to bolster homegrown industries. Last month, Mexico increased tariffs on U.S. pork imports to 20 percent, while Chinese taxes on pork imports from the U.S., increased in July, are now more than 70 percent.â€œThe last few years (have) been great. Weâ€™ve had some real good years, real profitable years and productive years,â€? Boerboom said. â€œRight now, theyâ€™re tough. The market has dropped dramatically in the last month or so.â€?The price of lean hog dropped about a third since early July, according to data from Business Insider. About 30 percent, or $717 million, of Minnesota pork was exported abroad in 2016, the most recent year of data available, according to the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.The U.S. Department of Agriculture is reporting higher volumes of some pork products, including pork belly and trimmings stockpiled in cold storage facilities. Pork industry watchers fear stockpiles will increase due to falling foreign demand.Boerboom says his farm hasnâ€™t adjusted the number of pigs it produces in response to the tariffs, but his family has dropped the weight of pigs ready for sale by about 15 pounds to save money on feed and ultimately send less meat to market. When pigs are close to maturation, they can eat up to 90 centsâ€™ worth of food per day, Boerboom said, cutting into profits.For now, theyâ€™ve also shelved some expansion ideas.Others watchingPork represents the most direct hit to Minnesota meat producers due to trade disputes so far, but others in the stateâ€™s ag industry have been hit, too.Trade disputes have also affected prices for corn and soybeans, Minnesotaâ€™s two biggest agricultural exports, and tariffs on dairy from China and Mexico are now in effect, too.Minnesota agricultural exports by commodity, 2016 Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, compiled by Minnesota Department of AgricultureOther Minnesota agricultural sectors havenâ€™t been hit hard, but are closely watching federal trade policy.Turkey, another big Minnesota industry, hasnâ€™t been hit with any new tariffs. U.S. poultry has been banned from China since the 2015 avian flu outbreak, so China is less of a concern for that industry at the moment.Turkey producers are, however, paying attention to North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations in the hopes that Mexico continues to be a major destination for Minnesota turkey. Of the 90 percent of Minnesota turkey sold out-of-state, about 15 percent goes abroad â€” much of it to Mexico â€” according to the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association.â€œOur turkey farmers are watching the trade news closely and we have been in contact with our leaders in Washington, D.C. to make sure they understand how important trade is to us,â€? the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association said in a statement to MinnPost.Despite new tariffs from Canada and China, the Minnesota Beef Council says beef has not seen the same effects soybeans and pork have.Long-termLast month, the Trump administration announced $12 billion in agriculture aid aimed at stabilizing some of the industries affected by foreign tariffs, such as soybean, corn and pork farmers. But Boerboom is concerned the bailout wonâ€™t really help pig farmers.â€œTheyâ€™ve announced the big agriculture package, but pork production has never had any government subsidies or government floor,â€? he said. â€œCorn, soybeans, milk â€” theyâ€™ve had some government program â€¦ they have no idea where the pork producers are because weâ€™ve never had a program.â€?These types of tariffs are painful for farmers, but, says Marin Bozic, a professor in the applied economics department at the University of Minnesota, the long-term concern is that the U.S.â€™s trade competitors are loosening trade restrictions, while the U.S. tightens them.â€œOur competitors are signing free trade agreements left and right: New Zealand, Australia, the European Union. All of them have in the past few years entered into new kinds of multilateral as well as bilateral trade agreements with our major markets,â€? Bozic said. â€œThat may not be the story of the day, because tariff retaliations and trade wars (steal) the limelight, but longer-term, without comprehensive market access that matches or exceeds what our competitors enjoy, we will struggle.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Trump administration contends China has deployed predatory tactics in a push to overtake U.S. technological dominance.In this July 4, 2018, photo, a robot from Chinese search company Baidu welcomes visitors to a developer event in Beijing, China. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)The United States and China launched what Beijing called the â€œbiggest trade war in economic historyâ€? Friday, imposing tariffs on billions of dollars of each otherâ€™s goods amid a spiraling dispute over technology.The Trump administration is confronting China over development tactics it says include stealing technology or pressuring foreign companies to hand it over. American officials worry U.S. industrial leadership will be eroded by Chinese plans to create tech champions in fields including robotics, biotech and artificial intelligence.Washington imposed 25 per cent duties on $34 billion of imports from China, the first in a series of possible increases that President Donald Trump says could affect up to $550 billion of Chinese goods, more than the total amount China exported to the U.S. last year.The first round targets Chinese industrial goods, not consumer products, in an attempt to limit the impact on U.S. households, but companies that rely on Chinese-made machinery or components may eventually have to pass along increased costs to customers.The Chinese Foreign Ministry said â€œretaliatory tariffsâ€? also took effect, but provided no other details. The Communist Party newspaper Peopleâ€™s Daily said tariffs were imposed on a list of goods issued last month that included soybeans, pork and electric vehicles. U.S. soybean farmers have been particularly concerned, and the price of soybeans has plunged 17 per cent over the past month on tariff fears.Washington has â€œignited the biggest trade war in economic history,â€? said a Commerce Ministry statement.Related: Trump complains about â€œSTUPID TRADEâ€? with ChinaRelated: Trudeau thanks Canadians for standing up for each otherDuring an official visit to Bulgaria, Chinaâ€™s No. 2 leader, Premier Li Keqiang, said â€œno one will win by fighting a trade war, yet China will take countermeasures in the face of unilateral moves.â€?Companies worry the dispute could chill global economic growth, but Asian financial markets took Fridayâ€™s developments in stride.Japanâ€™s main stock index, the Nikkei 225, gained 1.1 per cent while the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.5 per cent. Hong Kongâ€™s Hang Seng also rose 0.5 per cent.The conflict between the worldâ€™s two biggest economies reflects chronic tension in their relationship as customers, business partners, and increasingly competitors. It also is rooted in the clash between American notions of free trade and Beijingâ€™s state-led development model.Chinaâ€™s ruling Communist Party has insisted on making changes at its own pace while sticking to state-directed technology development seen as the path to prosperity and global influence. Beijing has announced reforms this year including ending limits on foreign ownership in its auto industry, but none directly addresses complaints that are fueling its conflict with Washington.On Thursday, Trump said higher tariffs on an additional $16 billion in Chinese goods were set to take effect in two weeks.After that, the hostilities could intensify: Trump said Washington is ready to target an additional $200 billion in Chinese imports â€” and then $300 billion more â€” if Beijing does not yield.That would bring the total of targeted Chinese goods to $550 billion â€” more than the $506 billion in goods that China shipped to the United States last year.Chinese officials reject accusations they steal or force foreign companies to hand over technology. But rules on auto manufacturing and other industries require companies to work through state-owned partners, obliging them to share know-how with potential competitors.Other governments express similar complaints toward Beijing, but Washington has alienated potential allies by raising import duties on steel, aluminum and autos from Europe, Canada, Mexico and Japan. Some have responded by hiking their own tariffs on U.S. goods.Trumpâ€™s confrontational outlook applies to other trading partners as well as China, said Tai Hui, chief strategist for JP Morgan Asset Management, in a report.â€œThis is a potential concern for the outlook of corporate investment and consumption around world,â€? Hui said.The official China Daily newspaper accused the Trump administration of â€œbehaving like a gang of hoodlums.â€? It said they would damage the global economy unless other countries stop them.â€œThere should be no doubting Beijingâ€™s resolve,â€? the newspaper said.Forecasters say global economic growth could be reduced by up to 0.5 percentage points in 2019-20 if both sides wind up raising tariffs on $250 billion of imports.The American Chamber of Commerce in China appealed to both sides to negotiate.â€œThere are no winners in a trade war,â€? the chamberâ€™s chairman, William Zarit, said in a statement. Companies want fairer treatment but will be hurt by U.S.-Chinese tensions, Zarit said. â€œWe urge the two governments to come back to the negotiation table.â€?___Wiseman and Superville reported from Washington.

"President Donald Trump pauses as he speaks at the North Side Gymnasium in Elkhart, Ind., Thursday, May 10, 2018, during a campaign rally.If a trade war is coming, the cheesemakers of Wisconsin are standing in the line of fire. So are the farmers of the Great Plains and the distillers of Kentucky. And the employees of iconic American brands like Harley-Davidson and Levi Strauss.The likelihood of a trade conflagration leaped closer to reality this week after the United States imposed a tariff on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union.Infuriated, the jilted U.S. allies vowed to retaliate with tariffs of their own. And in a separate dispute, China is poised to penalize $50 billion in U.S. goods â€” many of them produced by supporters of President Donald Trump in America's agricultural heartland.'They're going to hit the farmers,' said Bryan Klabunde, a farmer in northwestern Minnesota. 'We want things fair for all industries, but we're going to take the brunt of the punishment if other countries retaliate.'President Donald Trump, who entered office promising to rip up trade deals and crack down on unfair trading practices, is clashing with trading partners on all sides. To the north, he's battling Canada; to the south, Mexico; to the east, Europe; across the Pacific Ocean to the west, China and Japan.'The president seems to be creating trade (and other) disputes with everyone â€” allies and adversaries alike â€” and it's difficult to discern any coherent strategy,' said Rod Hunter, a former National Security Council staffer under President George W. Bush. 'The impacts of the disputes have been limited so far, but the economic and political costs will go up as retaliation by trading partners begins in earnest.'Mexico, for instance, plans to retaliate against the steel and aluminum tariffs by targeting U.S. cheese, among other products.'It's our second-largest market,' Jeff Schwager, president of Sartori, a cheese company in Plymouth, Wisconsin, said of Mexico. Retaliatory tariffs 'will reduce sales â€” there's no question.''The hard-earned sales we've secured in Mexico could be at risk given the potential for retaliation,' the National Milk Producers Federation warned in a statement.The EU is threatening to penalize Kentucky bourbon and the motorcycles of Wisconsin-based Harley-Davidson. The potential tariffs pack a political punch: They'd hurt constituents of House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican.On Friday, reporters in Louisville, Kentucky, asked McConnell if he thought the Europeans were trying to get his attention.'Well,' the Senate leader said, 'they got my attention. They didn't need to do that. These are our friends. These are not enemies. Canada and Mexico, Europe â€” these are our allies, and we need to work this out in a way that's comforting to everyone.'Harley-Davidson has already absorbed higher steel and aluminum costs since Trump first announced the metals tariffs three months ago. Now, the threats of retaliatory tariffs from abroad raise the fear of higher prices for Harley motorcycles sold outside the U.S.In a statement, Harley-Davidson said retaliatory tariffs 'would have a significant impact on our sales' in those countries. The Milwaukee-based company said it was evaluating options for controlling higher materials costs. In April, its chief financial officer warned that cost increases could be worse than the company forecast in January and might last for several quarters.The jeans maker Levi Strauss is also on the EU's target list.'American brands, workers and consumers will ultimately suffer,' the San Francisco-based company said in a statement.Ben Steffen, a dairy farmer who also grows corn, soybeans, and wheat on 1,900 acres southeastern Nebraska near Humboldt, is angry about the U.S. tariffs being imposed on America's closest trade partners and allies.'I'm upset because it hits me in my pocketbook from multiple angles,' he said. 'I sell beef, I sell corn, I sell soybeans and I sell milk. All of those products are vulnerable because we export significant amounts in those markets.'The milk market has been depressed for about three years, and farmers have struggled to break even. About 14 percent of U.S. milk production is exported; the largest customer is Mexico.'This is the worst possible thing to have for our milk market, and it's the same for every other commodity,' Steffen said. ' These are important relationships.'In Stockton, California, Jeff Colombini is worried about the financial damage a trade war would bring to his 1,800-acre farm. His company, Lodi Farming, exports walnuts, cherries and apples to Mexico, Canada, the European Union and other countries.'With these tariffs, it's going to make the product too expensive for the consumers in Mexico and in Canada and in the EU,' Colombini said. 'We're not going to be able to sell all of our crop. And so some of it is probably going to go unharvested or just dumped ... I have 200 employees, and they depend on the success of this operation for their jobs to feed and clothe their families.'A trade fight with Europe would also cause collateral damage across the Atlantic. Steelworkers in Port Talbot, Wales, who have struggled to protect their factory and 4,000 jobs, now face another threat.Union leader Mark Turner said workers are trying to sort out what the tariffs will mean for Port Talbot. But they feel 'everything is against us,' particularly given Britain's economic uncertainty as the country prepares to leave the European Union.'We will keep fighting,' Turner said. 'If we can't go into the American market, then there's other markets out there we will try and get into.An even higher-stakes trade dispute is playing out on the Pacific Rim. The United States and China are poised to impose tariffs on up to $200 billion worth of each other's goods in a battle over Beijing's strong-arm efforts to overtake U.S. technological supremacy.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is traveling to Beijing this weekend for talks aimed at preventing an all-out trade war between the world's two biggest economies. On the Chinese target list are American soybean farmers, who send about 60 percent of their exports to China.On Friday, Klabunde, who grows corn and soybeans on 3,000 acres near Waubun, Minnesota, spent two nerve-wracking hours with a hired hand, pulling a stuck tractor out of a drainage ditch. They finally got the machine free.'I think the tariffs and trade war scare me more than a stuck planter,' Klabunde said. 'I can lose only so much money on a stuck planter. I can lose a lot more money in a trade war.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Â© Andy Wong/Associated Press The U.S., which just fired the first shot in a trade war with China, is threatening up to $500 billion US in tariffs that would cover nearly all of the trade between the world's two largest economies.If one word could sum up how many Canadians feel about the Trump-shaped piano dangling over the country's economy, it would likely be 'disbelief.'Sure, we know all about America First, Rust Belt jobs and Canadian dairy subsidies, but certainly, even U.S. President Donald Trump knows how much trade has helped to make Americans rich, many Canadians say to themselves.The country's prosperity is so undeniable that it's easy, reasonable even, for Canadians to brush off Trump's anti-trade jeremiads as equal parts bluster, negotiating tactics and base-galvanizing political rhetoric.Even with trade barriers now going up between U.S. and China, it remains hard to imagine that Trump would blow up the global trading system given how much U.S. workers would suffer, right?Maybe not.The influence of Peter Navarro, China hawkThe national security reasoning the Trump administration initially used to justify steel and aluminum tariffs was widely seen as a pretext that allowed the White House to bypass Congress and use executive power to regulate trade and charge unilaterally down the path of protectionism.Even more troubling for Canada's economic fortunes, though, would be if that justification were sincere. In that light, Trump's reliance on Peter Navarro, an economist best known for his radical views on China, as one of his top trade advisers is an ominous sign.As much as it strains credulity that Navarro's theories on the dangers of China's economic rise could play a role in reshaping the global economic order, that becomes more likely with every step down the slippery slope of trade protectionism.Â© Andrew Harnik/Associated Press Peter Navarro's radical views on China are no longer on the fringes of economic thought now that he has the ear of the U.S. president.That's in part because Navarro is one of the few economic advisers who supports the protectionist trade policies Trump and his commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, are advocating, says Dan Ciuriak, a former deputy chief economist in Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs and now the head of his own consulting firm.'There's not a single trade economist who agrees that what they're saying even makes sense, apart from Peter Navarro,' Ciuriak said.A professor at the University of California, Irvine, the 68-year-old, Harvard-educated Navarro wasn't always fixated on China . Early in his career, he believed in free trade and ran for mayor of San Diego as a Democrat.But once his gaze turned to China around a decade ago, he found his 'muse,' as the New Yorker magazine once dubbed Navarro himself in relation to Trump.His three books on the subject paint a dark picture of a world in which the U.S. and China are hurtling toward a reckoning, and not just on trade.In the trailer for the documentary version of Navarro's second book, Death by China , a talking head opines, 'China is the only major nation in the world that is preparing to kill Americans.'Until recently, such anti-China sentiment only existed far beyond the periphery of policy discussions.In the U.S., trade policy has often taken a back seat to foreign policy . When viewed through Navarro's theories, moves such as saddling Canada and the European Union with auto tariffs , pulling out of NAFTA and the World Trade Organization, as Trump has threatened to do in the past, and opening up a trade war with China start to make sense.Fortress AmericaSimilarly, a president who sees China as a menace lurking around every corner wouldn't want the U.S. to rely on any foreign country for its economic or military needs.While economists see steel and aluminum tariffs as a tax on U.S. consumers that makes everything from beer cans to F-150s more expensive, but when imports are seen as a national security threat, that cost appears necessary in order to allow the industrial capabilities thought to be critical to the country's defence to be repatriated.'If you think in those terms, then Trump putting tariffs on production inputs makes sense, because you're forcing the supply chain to come back inside the U.S. borders,' said Ciuriak. 'What they're doing is breaking up the U.S. corporations' integration into global supply chains.'The blueprint for Trump's retreat into Fortress America is becoming more visible. Following through on his threats to hit China with $500 billion in tariffs would effectively erect a trade wall across the Pacific. Auto tariffs would do the same across the Atlantic while abandoning NAFTA would sever economic ties with the rest of North America.Â© Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press U.S. trade protectionism is already hitting exporters, such as Harley Davidson, which is moving a factory offshore to avoid retaliatory EU tariffs on U.S. goods.If the Trump administration keeps traveling this road, overseas markets are likely to dry up, and U.S. exporters will be the ones to take the early hits, as the case of Harley Davidson moving some of its production offshore has already shown.Big U.S. multinational companies are also likely to suffer . Apple, for one, must already be shuddering at the thought of losing access to China , the world's biggest smartphone market.U.S. less reliant on trade than someAn attempt to reshape the U.S. economy would run the risk of undoing the benefits of trade. That could result in a lower standard of living for Americans and potentially for Canadians, as well, given the integrated nature of our economies.'Maybe if you're willing to stick it out, it's doable over the very long term, but the medium term is miserable,' said Jacqueline Best, a political economist at the University of Ottawa.'The medium term is full of job losses and dislocation.'If Trump chooses to go full Navarro, he'll need to convince voters that the economic pain is worth it. The current strength of the U.S. economy could help him pull that off.A domestic market of 325 million people also makes an isolationist economic policy a more viable option than it would be for smaller nations. Trade just isn't as important to the U.S. as it is to most other countries. Exports account for only 12 per cent of U.S. gross domestic product compared to 31 per cent for Canada, according to World Bank data. Imports, similarly, comprise 15 per cent of U.S. GDP versus 33 per cent for Canada.Â© Jesco Denzel/German Federal Government via AP If the U.S. escalates its trade war, other world leaders will need to decide if their mutual interests run deep enough to try and save the current global trading order.The White House may well veer off its current course, but if it doesn't, Canada may need to work with other countries to blunt the damage. That strategy is already taking shape in the form of multilateral trade deals and a co-ordinated effort to hit vulnerable Republican congressional districts with retaliatory tariffs .Congress, which has the constitutional right to regulate trade, could potentially reclaim the trade file from the White House if November's midterm elections spur a renewed appetite to muster the veto-proof majority that is required to overturn the tariffs or revoke Trump's executive power to impose them.If that doesn't happen â€” and most analysts see the Congressional override option as unlikely â€” the international community will be left to reinvent a global trade order that's not anchored by the U.S.Beyond economic considerations, an increase in U.S. protectionism also puts into sharper relief the so-called trade-peace theory, a time-tested idea that says countries that trade together don't go to war.'One can hope the auto tariffs don't materialize, the steel tariffs are short term, that NAFTA gets back on its feet,' said Best. 'People have been hoping for the best for a long time, and it's pretty obvious now that was wishful thinking. If everyone is in a major recession or depression and we're fighting wars, is anyone winning?'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Â© XINHUAWith no sign of a let-up in the trade war with the United States, Chinaâ€™s top leaders are looking inward for new growth drivers in a move that could affect the nationâ€™s economic trajectory in the years ahead.While Beijing is keen to attract foreign investors by trumpeting its efforts at â€œopening upâ€?, it is also preparing for the possibility that growing international hostility might make it tougher to sell products to and acquire advanced technology from the US and other wealthy nations.In a white paper issued late last month, China said it planned to revitalise its domestic market by making its rust belt and vast countryside more self-sufficient.In his first public statement on what China should do to cope with growing hostility in the outside world, Chinese President Xi Jinping said last week that rising unilateralism and protectionism was forcing China to become more self-reliant, and â€œitâ€™s not a bad thingâ€?.Xi made the assessment during a visit to a state-owned factory in the rust-belt region of northeast China, which borders Russia and was once a base of the planned economy but is now the sick man of the economy.During his visit, Xi said the government would continue to back state-owned enterprises (SOE) to make them â€œbigger and strongerâ€?, despite complaints from Washington and Brussels that they distort market competition.According to Chinese government statements, academics and analysts, the message that China must â€œeventually rely on itselfâ€? suggests the emergence of a more inward-looking strategy, which in turn is a product of the perception that the US is trying to thwart Chinaâ€™s rise and that the trade war is just an element of that.Kong Dan, a â€œprincelingâ€? in the ruling Communist Party and former chairman of state-owned conglomerate Citic Group, said last month that the trade dispute between China and the US was â€œan argument about trade on the surfaceâ€? but ultimately about â€œpathsâ€?, as in Washingtonâ€™s market-led liberal democracy and Beijingâ€™s state-led model.â€œFor them [the US], if they donâ€™t contain us now, our development will set to threaten them,â€? he said in a speech at an academic conference. â€œSo they are attacking our path â€“ our model of development is seen as a serious threat to them.â€?Kong, who has close links to the leadership, said China had to develop a new mechanism to mobilise the countryâ€™s resources to cope with the new challenges.Ding Yifan, a senior researcher at Tsinghua Universityâ€™s National Strategy Institute, said China had no option but to seek â€œself-relianceâ€? if the US was unwilling to maintain the status quo on trade and economic interactions.Chinaâ€™s industrial value chain system, namely its ability to make everything â€œfrom a nail to a rocketâ€?, would help it to weather the confrontation, he said.Beijing made some preparations for the headwinds from the trade war in July when it told local governments to speed up infrastructure investment. But as the dispute has escalated, so Chinaâ€™s tactical responses have been accompanied by strategic blueprints.Days after the US imposed tariffs on US$200 billion worth of goods it imports from China, Beijing issued a plan to improve its rural economy in the 2018-22 period. It covered everything from garbage processing to â€œEngelâ€™s coefficientâ€? â€“ the ratio of spending on food in overall income.This rural development blueprint came just days after another state plan for â€œstimulating Chinese consumer spending potentialâ€?, aimed specifically at spending on tourism, health care and education. In one example, the National Development and Reform Commission is urging local authorities to cut admission fees at popular attractions to help boost domestic tourism.While Xi was touring the countryâ€™s northeast, Premier Li Keqiang was visiting the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, the cradle the countryâ€™s private economy, where he pledged equal government support for the private sector.According to official reports, Li told local governments to cut red tape and corporate burdens on private firms, and instructed banks not to favour state firms in lending.At a seminar with businesspeople in Taizhou, where the private economy has been thriving since the 1980s, Li vowed to continue economic restructuring and quicken the pace of building a â€œmarket and law-based international business environmentâ€?.Julian Evans-Pritchard, a senior economist for Capital Economics in Singapore, said the whole of the developed world was wary of Chinaâ€™s ambitions due to factors such as its â€œMade in China 2025â€? strategy for industrial upgrading, its â€œBelt and Road Initiativeâ€? to boost international trade and infrastructure links, and its traditional growth model.â€œThey [the Chinese authorities] are particularly concerned that the dispute with the US could be broadened towards the rest of the developed world,â€? he said. â€œIt is noticeable that the US, the European Union, Japan and South Korea in some respects have taken a joint stand on issues like intellectual property.â€œThe Chinese leadership are going to be more wary of the West as a result of recent experiences.â€?As a result, Beijing might have to rely more on its home market and domestic capabilities, he said.Some observers have said exports are no longer a deciding factor for Chinaâ€™s economic growth.Exports accounted for just 18 per cent of gross domestic product in the first half of 2018, of which about a fifth went to the United States.Former central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan and other economists said the trade war would have only a marginal impact on Chinaâ€™s GDP.According to official figures, Chinaâ€™s economy grew by 6.7 per cent in the second quarter, while exports in August grew 9.8 per cent from the same month of 2017. The official purchasing managersâ€™ also pointed to expansion.However, there are also signs of trouble in Chinaâ€™s US$12 trillion economy. Consumer spending growth has slowed to its lowest level in 15 years and other indicators suggest there are signs of weakness in Chinaâ€™s manufacturing base of Guangdong.Zhou Hao, a senior economist with Commerzbank, said there was no concrete evidence to show the trade war had had a substantial impact on Chinaâ€™s economy, but it had brought huge uncertainty and dampened domestic sentiment.Hu Xingdou, a Beijing-based economist, said Chinaâ€™s plan to increase self-reliance did not mean the country would reverse its economic reforms or opening up.â€œThe trend of economic reforms is irresistible and the opened door must not be shut,â€? he said. â€œOtherwise, it would lead to economic disaster and an all round retreat.â€?This article originally appeared on the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the leading news media reporting on China and Asia.

"Â© XinhuaThe current trade war between the United States and China is causing considerable stress to businesses in the line of fire. Even after the US midterm elections next month, the tension will not go away.Anti-China sentiment is growing in the US. Peter Navarro, one of US President Donald Trumpâ€™s top trade advisers, described 'death by Chinaâ€?.Manufacturers in China, both Chinese and non-Chinese, are reacting. Distribution centres for consumer products are shifting back to Hong Kong from China. Mainland electronics companies are relocating facilities to Taiwan so that final products exported to the US are not from China and therefore, subject to rules of origin, not liable to new US tariffs.As US Customs tightens compliance with rules of origin, trade diversion from China to Southeast Asia and other countries will be followed by investment diversion. China will instead supply components to countries exporting to the US. The trade war is accelerating a process already underway, which is the relocation of lower value-added manufacturing activities from China to Southeast and South Asia, and increasingly also to Africa.We can expect China to give greater emphasis to the Belt and Road Initiative as it girds itself for a prolonged trial of strength with the US. Chinese leaders do not want a fight with the US and are prepared to meet US demands more than halfway, but they cannot afford to be humiliated in the eyes of their own people. For decades to come, Chinaâ€™s growing economic, political and military weight is bound to create episodic instability in relations with the US, Europe, Russia, India and Japan.Asean as beneficiaryAs the world adjusts to a shifting geopolitical landscape, the greatest beneficiary is Asean. Asean is non-threatening to the major powers. The variable geometry of Asean enables it to adjust to regional stresses and strains by sometimes tilting in one direction, sometimes in the other. The current trade war has made Asean an attractive alternative or supplementary manufacturing base to China.Asean is perfectly positioned. Chinaâ€™s growing importance as an importer is a gradual sea change that has yet to be widely noticed. It will not be many years before China becomes the biggest market in the world, not only for raw materials and food, but also for manufactured products and services. This will have profound consequences for global trade, economics and politics.In November, Shanghai will host the first China International Import Expo. It will be on a massive scale and a signal to the world: Asean, which has a free-trade agreement with China, is becoming a major export manufacturing base not only for advanced economies but also China.The integration of the Chinese and Asean economies is well underway. When President Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative in Jakarta in October 2013, he expressed the hope that Chinaâ€™s bilateral trade with Asean would reach one trillion dollars by 2020. For this target to be reached, physical connectivity has to be improved, hence the importance of Belt and Road projects. Border procedures have to be further simplified. China-ASEAN logistics are nonetheless improving year by year, enabling a more complex division of labour. The 10 countries of Asean are seeing the benefits and vying with one another for Chinese trade and investment.VietnamVietnam has become Chinaâ€™s most important trading partner in Asean. This may come as a surprise to those who have only read about the tensions between the countries over their competing claims in the South China Sea. The Friendship Pass between Vietnam and China, once bitterly fought over, is now worthy of its name. Vietnamâ€™s costs are much lower than Chinaâ€™s; its workers no less hardworking or intelligent. It is also skilfully exploiting its geopolitical position as a counterweight to China in the eyes of competing powers.Before Donald Trumpâ€™s election as president, the US encouraged Vietnam to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership for precisely this reason. Institutionally, Vietnam hews close to the Chinese model. Like China, it is moving determinedly against rampant corruption. Despite similarities to China, however, Vietnam defines its own identity in contradistinction to China. Unlike the Chinese Communist Party, which has split many times in its history, the Vietnamese Communist Party, with as long a history, has never split. Vietnam is set to become an economic powerhouse in Asean.ThailandOn the surface, Thailandâ€™s political instability will persist. General elections in February next year will not restore the country to full democracy because the army remains dominant. Many Thais think this is a good thing. A new king is asserting a new position which will take time to clarify. Beneath the surface, however, Thai society is remarkably stable. Thailandâ€™s economic prospects are bright. It benefits from Chinaâ€™s rise without having a common border with China to complicate bilateral relations. A high-speed rail link connecting Bangkok, Vientiane and Kunming is due for completion in 2021. Thailand also maintains good relations with the US, with which it still has a security alliance. Japanese companies feel the most comfortable in Thailand. Thailandâ€™s location gives it a natural centrality in Southeast Asia.LaosThe Mekong, once a river dividing two worlds, now connects China to Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Between Vietnam and Thailand are Laos and Cambodia. Laos, which endured more bombing than all of Europe during the second world war, is making steady economic progress. Many bridges across the Mekong link it to Thailand.China is building fast rail from Yunnan to Vientiane at great speed. Laos, which is the origin of 60 per cent of the Mekong water flowing into the South China Sea, has abundant hydropower potential and is becoming a major exporter of electricity to its neighbours. From landlocked, it is now land-linked.CambodiaThe recent general elections in Cambodia were heavily loaded in favour of the incumbent. Notwithstanding, the voter turnout was high, and many Cambodians are relieved that there is political stability. From Year Zero not long ago, when much of the countryâ€™s elite was killed in a genocide, the country has made remarkable progress. The physical infrastructure is improving year by year. An economy that was mainly dependent on rice exports, apparel manufacturing and tourism is graduating to higher value-added manufacturing. China is an important source of investment but by no means not the only one. In the last few months, manufacturers seeking an alternative to China are showing sudden interest in Cambodia.MyanmarMyanmar has received much negative news coverage in recent years over the plight of Muslims in Rakhine state but that is far from the whole story. The humanitarian crisis demands urgent attention. Many outside Myanmar call them Rohingyas, including Pope Francis, but the name 'Rohingyaâ€? is pointedly not used by the Myanmar government and army because it was not an ethnic group identified among the 135 listed in the Constitution of the Union of Burma. That constitution was drawn up in 1947 under the leadership of Aung San (father of Aung San Suu Kyi) who founded the Burmese Army and led the struggle for independence. The complicated history of the Rohingya problem goes back to the British Raj in India (which included Burma) and, before that, to the kingdom of Arakan. It is important to separate the humanitarian issue, which cries out for urgent international attention, from the political issue of indigenous citizenship, which is principally a bilateral problem between Myanmar and Bangladesh.There is also the challenge of terrorism. In a recent lecture in Singapore, Aung San Suu Kyi reminded the audience that 'the danger of terrorist activities, which was the initial cause of events leading to the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine, remains real and present today.â€?However, despite the Rohingya problem, the Myanmar economy is gradually picking up speed. Because of her reluctance to use many capable senior officials from the previous military government, Aung San Suu Kyiâ€™s government lacks expertise and experience. Domestic and foreign investors are frustrated by the slow speed of decision-making. The physical infrastructure is still woeful. Chinaâ€™s Belt and Road Initiative is therefore a godsend. In September, a memorandum of understanding to establish a China-Myanmar economic corridor was signed. Across the river from Yangon, a Chinese state-owned enterprise (subject to a Swiss challenge on terms and conditions) will help to build a new city, like a Pudong to Shanghai, with the immediate objective of creating two million manufacturing jobs in five years.If Myanmar can quickly improve the efficiency of its public administration, it stands to benefit hugely from investment diversion caused by the trade war between China and the US. China is already Myanmarâ€™s number one investment partner.IndonesiaIndonesia, under President Jokowi, has made great strides in the last four years. Hundreds of infrastructure projects are being implemented across this vast archipelago. Jakarta, if not Java as a whole, has become a giant construction site. With better physical connectivity, logistics costs, which are presently high, will come down. Indonesia enjoys competitive advantage in resource-based industries because of abundant natural resources. Higher-value manufacturing investments are, however, not as forthcoming. Tightly-organised modern supply chains are intolerant of disruptions, especially those caused by natural disasters which seem to affect Indonesia disproportionately. Currently, many investors are a little jumpy because of uncertainty over the outcome of parliamentary and presidential elections next year.Longer term, however, with a young and expanding population, Indonesia is on track to become one of the worldâ€™s biggest economies after the US, China and India. It is a market which no multinational corporation can ignore.PhilippinesThe Philippines is another country in Asean which is prone to natural disasters. Every time a super typhoon hits, there is severe disruption to supply chains and life in general. This handicaps the ability of the Philippines to attract sophisticated manufacturing. Notwithstanding, the Philippine economy has been growing smartly. Its greatest resource is its people. However, it is a sad commentary on the overall system that many Filipinos are more valuable working outside the Philippines than in it. That the total number of Filipinos working in foreign countries has crested at 10 million is therefore a good sign. As infrastructure improves year by year, partly with Chinese help, the Philippines is becoming more attractive to manufacturing investments for fast-moving consumer goods, especially by American companies.President Duterte is an atypical leader who, despite being shunned by the Manila establishment, has done reasonably well for the economy and remains wildly popular among large segments of the population inside and outside the country. Whoever his successor may be in 2022 is unlikely to take on his firebrand style and may re-triangulate the countryâ€™s foreign policy vis-Ã -vis China and the US. Once the Philippine economy reaches a certain level of development, the global Philippine network that the country can tap gives it a unique advantage in Asean.MalaysiaMalaysia had an unbelievable stroke of good luck when the egregiously corrupt administration of Prime Minister Najib Razak was peacefully replaced in the general elections of May 2018. In the euphoria which followed, expectations rose to the sky. That has since subsided some. But there is no doubt that a new, happier chapter has opened in the history of Malaysia. The redoubtable Mahathir Mohamad, still sprightly at 93, appointed a Chinese as finance minister and an Indian as attorney general. There is a chance that a brain drain which went on for decades may now be reversed. Malaysia is a well-endowed country with good infrastructure and a relatively well-educated population. Higher oil prices will make it easier for the new government to mend its finances. Boondoggle belt and road projects are rightly being renegotiated (to Chinaâ€™s embarrassment). ButMalaysiaâ€™s close links with China will not be too badly affected, neither under Mahathir nor under a future Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Malaysia sees itself as the successor state to the old Malacca, which flourished on Chinese trade under the protection of Ming China.BruneiTucked between Malaysia and Indonesia, tiny Brunei floats along nicely, buoyed up by rising energy prices and a rising Asian tide. Asean provides an inner zone of stability and security. Strengthening relations with China provide the sultanate with additional insurance. Bruneiâ€™s EEZ in the South China Sea has abundant oil and gas reserves. China has never objected to Bruneiâ€™s EEZ claim which cuts deep into Chinaâ€™s nine-dash line.SingaporeSingaporeâ€™s nonpareil geographical and cultural position in maritime Asia is not an accident of history. Singapore was established 199 years ago by the British East India Company for 19th century Chinese trade. Chinese trade today is much bigger and will take Singapore far. Singapore is a traditional hub for goods, services, information, intellectual property and money. A pioneer leader of Singapore once remarked that Singapore should always welcome badly-treated people and badly-treated money. At its core, Singapore is a hub for people and cultures from different parts of the world. All of Asean, indeed much of the world, has its reflection in Singapore. Not surprisingly, Singapore is a strong proponent of free trade.When trade is not so free, Singapore helps to iron out distortions. Even if there was a breakdown of the World Trade Organisation, Singaporeâ€™s economic role in international trade and finance would not diminish. It might even be enhanced. Never taking a tranquil regional or international environment for granted, the Singaporean government has taken the precaution of negotiating a slew of free trade agreements, including bilateral pacts with the US, Japan, Korea, China, Australia, India, the Gulf Cooperation Council and Europe, and regional agreements like Asean and the CPTPP (the TPP without the US). In ASEANâ€™s variable geometry, Singapore is a pivot point. Singaporeâ€™s biggest challenge today is domestic. A sizeable segment of the population is reacting against rapid globalisation and growing income inequality. Since the general elections of 2011, the people and government have turned inward. But it is necessary for Singapore to re-establish its internal balance first before reopening itself to the many opportunities surrounding the city state.Asean neutralityThe integration of the Chinese and Asean economies is being hastened by trade and political tensions between China and the US. For every Asean country, China is already the largest trading partner. However, China knows that, whatever the degree of integration, Asean will not allow itself to be locked into Chinaâ€™s embrace. In 2002, when the framework agreement for the Asean-China FTA was signed in Phnom Penh, Premier Zhu Rongji assured Asean leaders that China did not seek for itself an exclusive position in Southeast Asia. In addition to signing FTAs with many countries, including China and India, Asean has been a strong advocate of a larger FTA involving China, Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and India, called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, negotiations for which may be concluded soon. RCEP encompasses half the worldâ€™s people. The more advanced Asean countries are also members of the CPTPP.As a neutral regional organisation friendly to all the major powers, Asean welcomes investments from all directions. The greater the dependence on China, the greater the wish for Asean countries to diversify away from China. Japan, the US, India and Europe compete â€“ healthily â€“ for Aseanâ€™s favour. Japan and India are also involved in building Aseanâ€™s physical infrastructure. A strong US presence is particularly welcome. To a point, the US military presence helps to maintain strategic balance in Southeast Asia. But if confrontation between the US and China becomes severe, as it threatens to be, it is better for Asean not to take sides. Understanding this dynamic, China has redoubled its efforts to work with Asean on a code of conduct in the South China Sea. There is a reasonable hope that the agreement will be signed before too long.George Yeo wrote this for the Brunswick Group based in Hong Kong and Singapore, where he serves as senior adviser for geopoliticsThis article originally appeared on the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the leading news media reporting on China and Asia.

"Â© Provided by South China Morning Post Publishers LimitedTrade talks aimed at averting a US-China trade war will resume in Washington next week, the White House announced on Monday.Chinaâ€™s Vice-Premier Liu He will visit the US capital â€œto continue the discussions with the presidentâ€™s economic teamâ€?, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.Word of the visit by Liu, Chinaâ€™s top economic adviser, came three days after a US delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin left Beijing after two days of talks that produced no apparent consensus, leaving open the possibility that punitive tariffs on US$50 billion worth of imports from China would take effect in the coming weeks.In last weekâ€™s talks, the United States demanded that China cut the trade deficit the US faced by at least US$200 billion by the end of 2020. The US said its trade deficit with China was US$375.2 billion last year.Additionally, the US called on China to halt state subsidies for industries under its â€œMade in China 2025â€? plan.In the meantime, Chinaâ€™s trade surplus with the US continues to expand, growing by US$6.76 billion â€“ or nearly 44 per cent month on month â€“ to US$28.78 billion in April, according to Chinese customs data released on Tuesday.The surplus with the US was US$22.19 billion in April, up from US$15.43 billion in March.In the first four months of this year, the surplus with the US amounted to US$80.4 billion. The figure for the same time last year was US$70.9 billion, according to calculations based on official data.Chinaâ€™s overall trade surplus was US$28.78 billion in April, a stronger rebound than expected after a surprise US$4.9 billion deficit in March.In US dollar terms, Chinaâ€™s exports grew 12.9 per cent last month, compared with the same time last year. At the same time, imports rose 21.5 per cent year on year, faster than the 14.4 per cent increase in March and 16 per cent growth forecast.Analysts said the opening round of talks in Beijing last week served only to communicate each sideâ€™s position.The Chinese government released a brief statement wrapping up the trade talks on Friday, calling the negotiations â€œcandid and efficientâ€?. A statement from the White House described the discussions as â€œfrankâ€?.China called on the US to cease its â€œsection 301â€? investigation into Chinaâ€™s trade and industrial policies, and to lift restrictions on high-technology exports to China. That investigation prompted the US Trade Representative office to announce its US$50 billion list of targeted Chinese products, mostly machinery and electronics.In retaliation, China announced tariffs on an equivalent amount of imports from the US.Sanders did not provide any further details about Vice-Premier Liuâ€™s visit.The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Reactions to last weekâ€™s meeting in Chinaâ€™s state media had suggested Beijing was open to continuing talks.A commentary in the ruling Communist Party mouthpiece Peopleâ€™s Daily on Saturday described the talks by saying the â€œclouds are starting to part and the fog begins to disperseâ€? after more than a month of â€œwind and rainâ€?.It said that the talks marked a change from the recent tit-for-tat exchanges between Beijing and Washington and sent a positive signal for the global economy, adding: â€œThere is hope that the two nations will move away from confrontation and towards consultation.â€?Chinaâ€™s Commerce Ministry was studying measures to further lower import tariffs on some food, pharmaceuticals and medical instruments, Economic Information Daily reported on Monday, citing unidentified sources. If enacted, such a move would at least partly address US demands for easier access to Chinaâ€™s markets.Additional reporting by Zhenhua Lu, Bloomberg and Orange WangThis article originally appeared on the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the leading news media reporting on China and Asia.

"Â© REUTERSÂ© REUTERSAmerican tariffs have cemented the United Statesâ€™ bargaining power in its trade war with China, US President Donald Trump said on Monday after Beijing again warned of retaliation for any further levies and reportedly considered cancelling trade talks.Trump said tariffs had put the US in a very strong bargaining position and â€œbillions of dollars, and jobsâ€? had flowed into the US.â€œIf countries will not make fair deals with us, they will be â€˜Tariffed!â€™â€? he said on Twitter.The statement came as expectations mounted that the White House would announce new tariffs on US$200 billion in Chinese goods as early as Monday.If the US did go ahead with the tariffs, they would be the biggest round since the first batch on Chinese exports in July.Tariffs have put the U.S. in a very strong bargaining position, with Billions of Dollars, and Jobs, flowing into our Country - and yet cost increases have thus far been almost unnoticeable. If countries will not make fair deals with us, they will be â€œTariffed!â€? â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2018With the tariffs looming, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang warned that China would hit back if any more went into effect.â€œIf the US launches any new round of tariffs against China, China will inevitably take necessary retaliation, to protect our legitimate rights,â€? Geng said.The US and China have already imposed tariffs on US$50 billion of each otherâ€™s goods and the prospect of more could scuttle talks meant to help end the trade war.Last week, the US Treasury Department invited senior Chinese officials, including Vice-Premier Liu He, to the United States for talks with US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, an invitation Beijing welcomed.But The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the Chinese government was considering declining the offer if the US went ahead with the new tariffs.One senior Chinese advisory official said China would not negotiate â€œwith a gun pointed to its headâ€?, according to the report.Geng said on Monday that all trade talks between the two nations should take place on an equal footing.Despite Mnuchinâ€™s approach, Trump was reported to have instructed aides to proceed with plans for new tariffs on US$200 billion in Chinese products, according to people familiar with the discussions.Zhang Zhexin, a specialist in China-US relations from the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, said China might not send a senior delegation to the US because the tariffs would invalidate the reason for going in the first place.â€œIf tariffs are to be announced before the trade talks, there will be no point for the talks to go on because the purpose of the talks is to prevent such sanctions from happening,â€? Zhang said.He said Washingtonâ€™s double-handed approach â€“ of proposing trade talks while threatening to launch more tariffs â€“ was not working for China.Tao Wenzhao, a researcher for the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, agreed that China was unlikely to go ahead with the talks if new tariffs came in.â€œIf the US genuinely wants to solve problems, they would halt any further actions until after the talks. China will not entertain this kind of two-way approach that the US seems to have adopted. On the one hand you say you want to talk, on the other you put more tariffs on us. How can [China] know how to solve this problem with you?â€? Tao said.On Sunday, former Chinese finance minister Lou Jiwei, now chairman of the National Council for Social Security Fund, told a forum in Beijing that China had a number of retaliatory tools at its disposal, including restrictions on exports of goods, raw materials and components core to US manufacturing supply chains. He said such restrictions could even apply to Appleâ€™s iPhones, which are assembled in China.This article originally appeared on the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the leading news media reporting on China and Asia.

"Â© Provided by South China Morning Post Publishers LimitedPresident Xi Jinping has told the British ambassador to China that the Communist Party has â€œthe levers and the country had the resilienceâ€? to come out of a trade war in better shape than the United States.The remarks, made at a dinner, were revealed by Barbara Woodward, Britainâ€™s ambassador to China, and come as Beijing and Washington have held a series of talks aimed at preventing a trade war.The disputes include US complaints about alleged theft of American intellectual property and Chinaâ€™s massive trade surplus with America, which the Trump administration says has been created by unfair trading practices.â€œI was at this small dinner with Xi Jinping earlier this year and he was in studied and quite thoughtful mode about the potential trade war,â€? Woodward said during a speech at the University of Oxford on Tuesday.â€œHe said everyone would lose out, but he felt that the party had the levers and the country had the resilience to come out the other side, in better shape than the US,â€? Woodward said.Â© Provided by South China Morning Post Publishers LimitedShe added that while Xi was â€œnaturallyâ€? seeking to influence as well as inform in his comments, her sense was that â€œhe believed what he was sayingâ€?.Xiâ€™s speech in April about achieving technological independence from the US, Woodward said, was â€œcut from similar clothâ€?.The UK envoy described China as politically, economically and globally confident, but added: â€œOverconfident, perhaps.â€?â€œI think China underestimated the level of frustration that their state capitalist model was building up in different developed markets and in developing markets before that,â€? she said.Chinaâ€™s confidence resulted in what Woodward said was the countryâ€™s first breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration over Hong Kong.She did not elaborate, but the British government strongly criticised Chinese law enforcement officers for â€œkidnappingâ€? booksellers in 2015 who were physically in Hong Kong but accused of offences on the mainland.She also questioned whether other countries would benefit from Beijingâ€™s Belt and Road Initiative aimed at developing trade and infrastructure ties between China, Central Asia and beyond.â€œThe proof of the pudding, of course, will be in the eating. And the pudding without recipe or ingredients like the â€˜community of common destinyâ€™ or â€˜a shared future of mankindâ€™ or â€˜a new model of international relationsâ€™ rightly gives us pause,â€? she said.Woodward said there were areas where China and Britain could cooperate as the UK negotiates its exit from the European Union. These include climate change, intellectual property and medicine.Woodward insisted, however, that Britain would not kowtow to China on all issues in the future, nor automatically side with the United States on international issues.â€œIn blunt terms, the UK is not simply going to subcontract its foreign policies to the United States or to China,â€? Woodward said. Â© Provided by South China Morning Post Publishers LimitedWoodward made no mention of human rights issues in her speech, including the case of Liu Xia, the widow of the rights activist and late Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo.She has been held under house arrest since 2010, but has never been charged with any offence. Germany has demanded the Beijing authorities release her.This article originally appeared on the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the leading news media reporting on China and Asia.

"Â© Photographer: iStock/Getty Imagesâ€œA wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy,â€? according to the Chinese general Sun Tzu. â€œOne cartload of the enemyâ€™s provisions is equivalent to 20 of oneâ€™s own.â€?The lesson of that maxim â€” that leaders need to pay close attention to the economics of conflict, and make sure that costs are imposed more on the enemy than the home front â€” holds as true today as it did two and a half millennia ago. Washington doesnâ€™t appear to be listening.The White Houseâ€™s promise to impose 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods on top of the existing $50 billion issued this week 1 â€” with an option to add a further $200 billion on top of that â€” would put almost the entirety of the U.S.â€™s $526 billion of imports from China in jeopardy.That may look like a strong move. China, with only $155 billion or so of imports from the U.S., simply doesnâ€™t have enough trade to respond in kind. In truth, however, the big numbers conceal some deep weaknesses.To see why, consider Sun Tzu. The initial lists put out by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer have been surgical in targeting only goods that can avoid a widespread popular backlash against President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade policies. Most of the 1,102 products on the latest tally are intermediate goods such as storage heaters and lubricating oils, whose raised costs are unlikely ever to directly hit consumersâ€™ hip pockets.The exceptions threatened to date have tended to be rarely purchased durable goods (such as the washing machines that have risen 17 percent in price since tariffs were imposed in a separate move in January), or products such as flat-screen televisions that have become dramatically cheaper over the past decade.In both cases, the products are ones where average Americans might be expected to initially miss the pain of rising costs â€” and even flat-screen TVs were removed from Lighthizerâ€™s most recent list after consultation with industry.In other words, Lighthizer has been ensuring that his trade armies forage on the enemy. The tariffs will hurt the revenues of Chinese exporters, as higher prices damp demand while U.S. wholesalers switch to other countries wherever substitution is possible. 2 By avoiding swathes of consumer products, meanwhile, heâ€™s limited the risk of popular discontent.The problem is that the U.S. is at a strategic disadvantage on this front. As weâ€™ve written before, Chinaâ€™s exports to the U.S. tend to be consumer goods, while trade in the opposite direction is weighted toward raw materials and intermediate parts. That means Lighthizer is already close to or past the limit where he can raise prices on Chinese products without American voters noticing.What are the next major categories of goods where the U.S. can impose further tariffs? Mobile phones, with $73 billion of imports from China in 2017, would be next on the list, followed by computers and accessories; furniture and mattresses; toys and games; clothing and shoes; and televisions. The six categories together amount to another $273 billion.Such action would smack Middle America between the eyes, and Washington could be expected to do its utmost to avoid it. But the wiggle room is limited, as the Council on Foreign Relationsâ€™ Brad Setser has pointed out. While itâ€™s possible in theory to compile the next $200 billion hit list by imposing levies on almost every traded item other than those big six consumer categories, thereâ€™s no way to reach Trumpâ€™s final total without doing so.Look at how the two commanders-in-chief are arraying their armies and you should be concerned about Americaâ€™s ability to withstand attack.The careful curation of Lighthizerâ€™s existing lists suggests a general aware of his weaknesses on the home front who is following orders from a commander oblivious to the risks. Should the trade war begin in earnest, Washington had better be ready with an explanation for the rising cost of living and decline in farm exports ahead of Novemberâ€™s midterm elections.Meanwhile, Chinaâ€™s domestic industrial machine â€” which managed to offset the wrenching export declines from the 2008 financial crisis without pushing economic growth below 6 percent â€” is roaring in readiness. Steel production in May rose 12 percent from a year earlier, the fastest pace in five years, while thermal electricity output climbed 10 percent. That stimulus may worsen Chinaâ€™s economic imbalances and harm the global climate, but â€” combined with the relative immunity from popular anger youâ€™d expect in an authoritarian state â€” should keep the nation strong as the trade battle heats up.It may well be that the White Houseâ€™s latest threat is no more than a gambit. Americaâ€™s consumers had better hope so. If not, the front line of this conflict is coming to their hip pockets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(Bloomberg) -- Oil had its worst week since late May as the U.S. considered tapping national crude reserves to quell rallying gasoline prices amid a restoration of key Libyan supplies that may throw worldwide supply and demand out of whack.Futures sank 3.8 percent this week in New York. The Trump administration may draw on the 660 million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase domestic supplies, according to two people familiar with the situation. Meanwhile, Libyaâ€™s state oil producer restarted output from a major field that had been shut for months. The price slump was truncated on Friday when Iran disputed Russian claims about OPECâ€™s agreement to lift production.â€œItâ€™s been an avalanche of bearish headlines since Wednesday,â€? said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. â€œLibyan crude oil came out of nowhere. Nobody saw that coming back so fast.â€?Â© Bloomberg Trade War RiskOil has retreated since hitting a three-year high at the start of the month. U.S. President Donald Trump threatened tariffs this week on nearly half of all American imports from China, and China vowed to retaliate. As crude clawed back some of those losses on Friday, analysts pointed to doubts that Trumpâ€™s aggressive levies will actually go into effect. Some also cited supportive momentum from bullish equity-market action.â€œThe market is realizing that this is more of a negotiating tactic on behalf of the president,â€? said Michael Loewen, director and commodities strategist for Scotiabank. â€œCooler heads will eventually prevail in these trade negotiations.â€?The U.S. on Friday rejected Franceâ€™s request for sanctions waivers that would allow French companies to continue doing business with Iran. The move may indicate the U.S. wonâ€™t be as flexible as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently suggested.â€œThereâ€™s a lot of people in the market who think thereâ€™s going to be a number of waivers granted to ease the supply crunch, and I just donâ€™t see that happening,â€? said John Kilduff, founding partner for Again Capital LLC. â€œI think the administration is going to be playing this hardcore.â€?Recovering PricesWest Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery rose 68 cents to settle at $71.01 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 20 percent below the 100-day average.Brent for September settlement added 88 cents to $75.33 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.

"(Bloomberg) -- Soybean futures, which had been plummeting over the past month as the U.S. inched closer to a trade war with China, posted a record move higher on Friday as the promised tariffs were finally imposed.While purchases have slowed from China, the worldâ€™s biggest importer, American soybeans got so cheap that other countries have started to increase purchases, U.S. government data show.Futures for November delivery climbed 4.5 percent to $8.945 a bushel on Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest gain since the contract began trading in late 2014.

Electronic integrated circuits accounted for 40 percent of Taiwan's total exports.Hungary, whose biggest trading partner outside the EU is the United States, enjoys large investment inflows thanks to a large manufacturing base, particularly in the auto sector.

"American companies in China are being hurt by tariffs in the growing trade war between Washington and Beijing, according to a survey of hundreds of firms, prompting the U.S. business lobbies behind the poll to urge the Trump administration to reconsider its approach.The United States and China have imposed tariffs on $50 billion of each other's goods since July as trade frictions between the world's two biggest economies worsened, despite several rounds of negotiations.President Donald Trump has criticized China's record trade surplus with the United States, and has demanded that Beijing cut it immediately, threatening further tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of goods - and possibly more.The negative impact of the tariffs on U.S. companies has been 'clear and far reaching', according to the joint survey by AmCham China and AmCham Shanghai published on Thursday.More than 60 percent of U.S. companies polled said the U.S. tariffs were already affecting their business operations, while a similar percentage said tariffs by China on U.S. goods were having an effect on business.Companies reported the tariffs were pressuring profits, reducing demand for their products and driving up production costs.Roughly three-in-four firms surveyed said duties on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would hurt business further, and close to 70 percent said additional retaliatory Chinese tariffs would be bad for business.'This survey affirms our concerns: tariffs are already negatively impacting U.S. companies and the imposition of a proposed $200 billion tranche will bring a lot more pain,' said Eric Zheng, chairman of AmCham Shanghai.'If almost a half of American companies anticipate a strong negative impact from the next round of U.S. tariffs, then the U.S. administration will be hurting the companies it should be helping,' he said.Â© REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo FILE PHOTO: A U.S. flag is seen during a welcoming ceremony in Beijing'We support President Trump's efforts to reset U.S.-China trade relations, address long-standing inequities and level the playing field. But we can do so through means other than blanket tariffs.'On Wednesday, Larry Kudlow, who heads the White House Economic Council, told Fox Business Network that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had sent an invitation to senior Chinese officials to restart trade talks.More than 430 companies responded to the survey between Aug. 29 and Sept. 5, which Ken Jarrett, president of AmCham Shanghai, said had been conducted in part to provide AmCham with data for meetings with members of congress later this month.China may not be able to match future U.S. tariffs dollar for dollar and has warned that it would take other measures.More than 52 percent of respondents to the survey reported already suffering the consequences of such measures, mainly through increased inspections, slower customs clearance and 'other complications from increased bureaucratic oversight or regulatory scrutiny'.Nearly two-thirds of the companies that responded have not relocated nor were they considering moving manufacturing facilities away from China. But of those that were, the top destinations were Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent.Only 6 percent said they were considering relocation back to the United States, the survey said.Meanwhile, nearly a third of companies said they were considering delaying or cancelling investments, underscoring the heightened uncertainty created by the trade tensions.About 30 percent said they were adjusting supply chains by seeking to source components and/or assembly outside the U.S., and about the same number were seeking to source components and/or assembly outside China.On Wednesday, more than 60 U.S. industry groups launched a coalition - Americans for Free Trade - to take the fight against the tariffs public.(This corrected version changes million to billion in paragraph three)(Reporting by John Ruwitch; Editing by Kim Coghill)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Itâ€™s been quite a ride for Tesla buyers in China for the past few months.In May, a price cut on Tesla cars looked likely after Beijing announced it would bring its 25% tariff on imported cars down to 15% (paywall) from July 1. Instead, the electric car maker is raising prices now that the US-China trade war has kicked off in earnest.Listed prices for Tesla cars on the companyâ€™s Chinese website increased 20% over the weekend (paywall). The increase came after Beijing slapped a 25% additional tariff on imported American cars, in response to the US tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods imposed Friday (July 6). That brings the total import tariff for US cars to 40% (link in Chinese).A basic Tesla Model S with a roughly 300-mile range now costs about 849,000 yuan ($129,000), including value-added tax and tariffs, according to Teslaâ€™s Chinese site (link in Chinese). Thatâ€™s an increase from 710,000 yuan ($107,300) (link in Chinese) earlier. A Model X SUV now costs $140,100 (paywall), about $23,000 more than earlier.Tesla didnâ€™t immediately respond to requests for comment about the cause of the price hikes. But a local salesperson in Shanghai attributed the rise to the trade war and added that the new prices will remain through the year, reports the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.Itâ€™s a setback for Tesla in China, which contributed to 17% (pdf, p.118) of the companyâ€™s revenue in 2017. Unlike most foreign car makers in China, Tesla sells its cars independently as imports rather than via a joint-venture partnership, where foreign auto firms team up with a local manufacturer, which has an equal or controlling stake, to make cars for the local market.â€œRaising prices is going to hurt sales, but money-losing Tesla has to raise prices because they canâ€™t afford to fully absorb to the higher costs of [the] tariff,â€? analyst Efraim Levy of research firm CFAR told Reuters.Tesla has taken steps in recent months to manufacture in China, including setting up a company for research and development in Shanghai in May. A manufacturing hub could allow for exemption from import taxes. Teslaâ€™s chief executive Elon Musk recently said Tesla could open a China plant within another three years.That will take a lot of bureaucratic goodwillâ€”which may be in short supply right now toward US firms. But it seems like Teslaâ€™s working on it. According to Bloomberg, Musk is attending an event in Shanghai today with the government, and will attend another one tomorrow in Beijingâ€”though no further details about the meetings have been made public.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(Bloomberg) -- Chinaâ€™s official factory gauge fell more than expected in June, just as the worldâ€™s two biggest economies head toward a trade war.The manufacturing purchasing managers index stood at 51.5 in June, versus 51.9 in May, and the forecast of 51.6 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The non-manufacturing PMI, covering services and construction, rose to 55, the statistics bureau said Saturday, compared with 54.9 in May. Levels above 50 indicate improvement.A weakening domestic economy is the last thing policy makers need amid an escalating trade conflict, with both the U.S. and China threatening tariffs on tens of billions of dollars in trade from July 6. Partly in response to the darkening outlook, the central bank on Thursday signaled a shift to focus more on supporting growth, and was more cautious on a campaign to drive down debt that has caused credit growth to slow.Read More: Everything You Need to Know About the Burgeoning Trade WarÂ© Bloomberg Dialing Backâ€œChinaâ€™s economy will slow down for the rest of the year, but we donâ€™t need to worry about any stall yet,â€? said Zhu Qibing, chief macroeconomy analyst at BOC International China Ltd. in Beijing. â€œThe key is how international trade and the dispute between China and the U.S. will evolve.â€?A sub-index of new export orders fell to 49.8 from 51.2, signaling weakening demand from other countries. Gauges for new orders and the backlog of orders also dropped.â€œAs the trade friction between United States and China escalates, exports start to ebb,â€? China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing, which conducts the PMI survey with the NBS, said in a statement released with the data. â€œIn previous months, the companies expedited exports because they had foreseen this complicated situation of international trade.â€?Â© Bloomberg Heading DownwardWhat our economists say... â€œA gauge of export orders tumbled, dropping from expansion into contraction -- a clear sign that trade-war concerns are starting to weigh on sentiment,â€? Bloomberg economist Fielding Chen wrote. â€œGovernment policy has started tilting toward buttressing the economy.â€?The expansion of services held up while that of the construction sector accelerated, according to the NBS statement on the non-manufacturing index. Still, tighter control on local government debt has eroded infrastructure investment, and may eventually hurt building activity.With the services sector an ever-more-important pillar for the economy and the trade war focusing attention on Beijingâ€™s grip over doing business, China is slowly following through on pledges to open up to foreigners. A personal income tax cut is also underway, potentially boosting consumer spending.Read More: China Inches Open its Economy Again as Trump Tariffs Approachâ€œThe domestic demand is crucial, but that will not pick up immediately,â€? said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore. â€œThe economy hasnâ€™t bottomed out yet and the trade situation is grim.â€?A vibrant-yet-fragile part of the economy is facing a tough plight. The small factoriesâ€™ PMI stood at 49.8, while that of the big manufacturers held at 52.9, a sign of the funding squeeze that smaller companies face amid slowing overall credit growth. Policy makers have repeatedly signaled support, and the central bank announced a cut in required reserve ratios partly aiming to ease such a funding strain.To step up the efforts, central bank Governor Yi Gang said on Friday that the nation will carry out planned measures to deepen financial services to small and micro enterprises, according to the Peopleâ€™s Bank of China website.â€œWith the trade dispute threatening external demand, the authoritiesâ€™ major task in the second half will be to boost domestic demand,â€? said Wen Bin, a researcher at China Minsheng Banking Corp. in Beijing. Wen expects policy makers will increase fiscal support and reduce reserve requirement once or twice for the rest of this year.â€œThe authorities hope that banksâ€™ funds can flow to the sectors the nation is encouraging and supporting, especially to the smaller firms,â€?

"The port of Baltimore is one of the largest ports in the world. According to economists, the proposed tariffs that President Trump is putting forth could pose some serious implications for day-to-day operations.The announcement rocked financial markets all over the world Thursday as President Trump imposed tariff hikes on imported steel and aluminum from China, as well as the possibility of additional tariffs up to $60 billion, after complaints that Beijing steals or forces companies to hand over intellectual property, threatening national security.At the Port of Baltimore, officials declined comment for this story, but they have to be watching this all very closely, economists say.'About $5.1 billion a year goes through the port (of Baltimore) from China, so any sort of change of that is going to have an adverse impact on the port's business,' said Daraius Irani, of Innovation and Applied Research.China is the Port of Baltimore's second largest customer. A lower volume from China could mean cuts in jobs at the port and higher prices for goods.'Firms will be able to pass on a large majority of that tariff on to consumers and, in some instances, they may not be able to pass on as much, but generally speaking we would expect to see some prices to go up because of the tariffs,' Irani said.To make matters worse, China is firing back, announcing its own $3 billion dollar tariff proposal on U.S. goods, including pork, apples and steel piping. But, China trade experts feel this back and forth could actually lead to a compromise.'China has made it very clear from the outset, they do not want a trade war. They want to engage constructively with the Trump Administration and, most importantly, they want to understand what the Trump Administration's priority is for China,' said Jacob Parker, vice president of China Operations, U.S. China Business Council.Â© Provided by Hearst Television, Inc.Click here for a closer look at the proposed tariffs.Click here to see the day-to-day operations at the Baltimore Port.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nebraska and Iowa farmers find themselves in the crossfire of the trade war with China.The Chinese government officially announced Monday it will start levying tariffs on roughly 128 different American products including pork.The 25 percent surcharge is in retaliation to U.S. sanctions on Chinese steel and aluminum.The escalation of a trade war has producers concerned.'We want to sell more product to China not less,' said Nebraska Pork Producer Association Executive Director Al Juhnke.He said the Nebraska exports about $16 million in pork to China every year.'If it goes on long term, it's going to affect our rural economies here in Nebraska and the upper mid-West,' Juhnke said.Â© Provided by Hearst Television, Inc.There is also a ripple affect according to Juhnke.There are three pork processing plants in the state and hogs consume a lot of soybeans.Soybean growers are also concerned they may be targeted next.'We have heard directly from the Chinese government that soybean imports are a prime target for retaliation,' said Nebraska Soybean Growers Association Executive Director Lori Luebbe.She said Nebraska exports $820 million of soybeans a year to ChinaThat is the equates to one in three rows planted every year in the state is sold to China.'We should be talking about actions that grow this important market not risk losing it,' Luebbe said.'The U.S. government and farmers have worked for decades to establish markets for U.S. soybeans in China, these steel tariffs put years of work in jeopardy.'Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts said Monday he has had phone conversations with U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross recently.'So we have been giving our feedback into the administration in regards to these tariffs and the potential retaliation and detrimental effects on agriculture in our state,' Ricketts said.Ricketts, who made a trade mission to China in November said be believes the Trump administration is continuing to talk with China.He believes some progress is being made with tariff exemptions for Canada, Mexico, and Japan and the announcement last week, that South Korea will open markets to U.S. companies.'We certainly want to make sure what ever we do we don't disrupt the trade relationship we do have, ' Rickett said.Other farm group organizations expressed concern, saying a trade war couldn't come at a worse time.Producers are heading into their fifth year of low commodity prices that don't cover operating costs.'A trade war could make our vulnerable position substantially worse and so does that make us nervous? Yes,' said Nebraska Farmers Union President John Hansen.Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson said the tariffs will impact the state's already hurting ag economy.'China's response is what we had feared all along and we are extremely concerned about this turn of events,' Nelson said.Juhnke said Nebraska and many farm-belt states overwhelming supported Trump for president in the November election.He said they plan to head to Washington D.C. in the two weeks to make sure not only Nebraska's congressional delegation but others remember that.'What can we do together to coerce the administration to hopefully settle this in the next few weeks,' Juhnke said.'We hope and want to make sure that he is listening to his core base of supporters.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Â© Jae C. Hong, AP Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin speaks during a discussion at the Milken Institute Global Conference Monday, April 30, 2018, in Beverly Hills, Calif.WASHINGTON â€” President Trumpâ€™s treasury secretary said Sunday the U.S. will not impose $150 billion in threatened tariffs on China while the two countries negotiate a deal to reduce Americaâ€™s trade deficit with its economic rival.â€œWeâ€™re putting the trade war on hold,â€? Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Fox News Sunday. â€œWe have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to executeâ€? an agreement under which China would increase its purchases of U.S. goods.Mnuchin and other Trump administration officials held talks last week with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, focused on trying to resolve the trade dispute.The Trump administration had threatened to impose up to $150 billion in tariffs on Chinese products, part of an effort to address the U.S.-China trade imbalance and to penalize China for forcing American companies to turn over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market. China responded by targeting $50 billion in U.S. products.But Mnuchin said Sunday that last weekâ€™s talks resulted in â€œvery meaningful progress,â€? including an agreement from Chinese leaders to increase their purchase of American goods. He would not confirm reports that China had offered to increase its purchases by $200 billion.â€œWe have specific targets, Iâ€™m not going to disclose what they are,â€? Mnuchin told Fox Newsâ€™ Chris Wallace.Mnuchin said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will be traveling to China to follow up on â€œhard commitmentsâ€? from the Chinese to increase purchases in the U.S. energy and agriculture sectors.Mnuchin denied that the Chinese concessions were a result of Trumpâ€™s promise to help ZTE, a Chinese telecom giant, wiggle out of U.S. sanctions after it was found to be illegally selling equipment to Iran and North Korea.The U.S. Commerce Department has accused ZTE of violating a March 2017 settlement, in which the firm agreed to pay $1.19 billion for illegally shipping telecommunications equipment to Iran and North Korea.Last weekend, Trump suggested he wanted the U.S. to go easy on ZTE, tweeting that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping â€œto give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast.â€? In the tweet, Trump said he had instructed the Commerce Department to help ZTE because â€œtoo many jobsâ€? were being lost in China.â€œWe didnâ€™t agree to any quid pro quo,â€? Mnuchin said. â€œThat was completely independent of our trade negotiations.â€?The Treasury chief said all Trump did was ask Ross to look into the ZTE matter, and any changes made to that settlement will about â€œprotecting American technologyâ€? and American jobs.â€œThis is an enforcement issue,â€? Mnuchin said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And I say to everybody on this, the problem here is China. It is not President Trump. China has been getting away with this for decades.â€™â€™Â© OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP/Getty Images President Trump.Kudlow said a â€˜â€˜coalition of the willingâ€™â€™ was being formed to pressure President Xi Jinping, including by taking the issue to the World Trade Organization, to crack down on Chinaâ€™s trade practices. Kudlow declined to release a full list of countries involved during an interview on â€˜â€˜Fox News Sunday,â€™â€™ but he said Australia, Canada and much of Europe were among them.Administration officials tried to tamp down growing concerns about the impact of a trade war on farmers. They suggested the trade dispute may be resolved through negotiations and that the â€˜â€˜process may turn out to be very benign,â€™â€™ according to Kudlow.But they said they plan on moving forward on new tariffs on China.â€˜â€˜Weâ€™re listening to the Chinese. Weâ€™re willing to work with them,â€™â€™ Peter Navarro, director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, said on NBCâ€™s â€˜â€˜Meet the Press.â€™â€™â€˜â€˜But weâ€™re clear-eyed about this. Weâ€™re moving forward on a measured way with tariffs, with investment restrictions,â€™â€™ Navarro added. â€˜â€˜What we want from China is very clear. We want fair and reciprocal trade.â€™â€™Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declined to comment on the substance of trade talks with China during an interview on CBSâ€™ â€˜â€˜Face The Nation.â€™â€™ And he sought to head off concerns that protectionist trade policies would disrupt the growth of the U.S. economy.â€˜â€˜Whatever happens in trade, I donâ€™t expect it to have a meaningful impact on our economy. And the president has said - sectors like agriculture, heâ€™s prepared to defend,â€™â€™ Mnuchin said.Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., warned that new tariffs on American products could cripple farmers in his state, which relies heavily on exporting soybeans - the stateâ€™s second-largest crop.â€˜â€˜Weâ€™re talking about a lot of money that goes down, just on the speculation of having a tariff put in place,â€™â€™ Rounds said on â€˜â€˜Meet the Press.â€™â€™Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., acknowledged that U.S. industries may take a short-term hit in the trade dispute, saying, â€˜â€˜There is no way for us to address China without absorbing some pain here.â€™â€™ But he defended Trumpâ€™s plans as a sound long-term strategy.â€˜â€˜At the end of the day, the president promised if he got to be president he would push back against China,â€™â€™ Graham said in an interview on ABC Newsâ€™ â€˜â€˜This Week.â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜Thatâ€™s exactly what heâ€™s doing. Theyâ€™re pushing back against us. I like our chances of prevailing if we stick with it.â€™â€™Sen.

"But with only days left before the exemptions expire and punitive tariffs take effect, itâ€™s dawning on foreign leaders that decades of warm relations with the United States carry little weight with a president dismissive of diplomatic norms and hostile toward the ground rules of international trade.What began as a way to protect American steel and aluminum jobs has since become a cudgel that the Trump administration is using to extract concessions in other areas, including car exports to Europe or negotiations to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada.As a May 1 deadline looms, the decision on whether to grant permanent exemptions to the steel and aluminum tariffs, and to whom, appears likely to come down to the whims of President Donald Trump, who has been influenced by brief interactions with foreign leaders and has seesawed between scrapping and rejoining global trade deals.The European Union, the United Statesâ€™ biggest trading partner, indicated over the weekend that it was losing hope of reaching an agreement in the face of what many of the regionâ€™s political leaders regard as unreasonable demands. While a last-minute extension of the deadline is possible, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor who met last week with Trump in Washington, said on Sunday that Europe was ready to retaliate if Trump did not grant an exemption.The German government said in a statement that Merkel, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain agreed after speaking on the phone that if the tariffs go into force, â€œThe European Union should be ready to decisively defend its interests within the framework of multilateral trade rules.â€?The uncertainty is sowing chaos in international supply networks. Car companies and other manufacturers do not know whether ships carrying steel may suddenly be barred from U.S. ports.Some countries are confident they will avoid the tariffs. Australia is treating an exemption as if itâ€™s a done deal. Brazil, which primarily exports slab steel to U.S. manufacturers, is hoping to escape by agreeing on limited quotas for more sophisticated products. Argentina is counting on the good relationship between its president, Mauricio Macri, and Trump.â€œIn the conversations that we have on the issue, the positive relationships between our governments â€” and our presidentsâ€” certainly comes up,â€? Miguel Braun, Argentinaâ€™s trade secretary, said in an interview.But itâ€™s unclear whether the confidence is justified. The White House has not confirmed that Australia, Brazil or Argentina will receive exemptions.In terms of the potential disruption to the global economy, the dispute with Europe may be the most critical. The United States and European Union account for about one-third of world trade.Only a few years ago the United States and Europe were discussing the possibility of eliminating almost all trans-Atlantic trade barriers. Now they are stymied by fundamentally different worldviews. As the Europeans see it, Trump is demanding concessions that would make them accomplices in dismantling a postwar trade framework they hold sacred.The Europeans want to play by the rules of the World Trade Organization; the Americans are making demands that would force the Europeans to break them.â€œIf we stick to the rules,â€? said Thiess Petersen, an analyst at the Bertelsmann Foundation in Germany, â€œthere is no chance for concessions.â€?German cars, a particular target of presidential ire, are one of the major sticking points.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has been handling talks with the European Union, has been pushing the 28-nation bloc to reduce its tariffs on imported American cars as one way of cutting its trade surplus with the United States. In a recent interview with CNBC, Larry Kudlow, the chief economic adviser, said that the United States wanted more concessions before it granted a permanent exclusion.But if the European Union accepted the demand for lower car tariffs, international treaties would require it to apply similar terms to automobiles from all other members of the World Trade Organization.The biggest beneficiary might be China. A member of the WTO, China is keen to become an auto exporter and would be thrilled to get easier access to Europe without giving up anything in return.The Europeans are offended that they are being asked to negotiate in the first place. Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, said last week that the union would discuss terms of trade with the United States only after it had received a permanent and unconditional exemption to the steel and aluminum tariffs.â€œWhen that is confirmed by the president,â€? Malmstrom told reporters in Strasbourg, France, â€œwe are willing as always to discuss anything. But we are not negotiating anything under threat.â€?In an extension of the disconnect between the two NATO allies, the president has expressed annoyance that he canâ€™t just bypass the European Union apparatus altogether and work out deals with favored leaders like Macron. That approach would be illegal under the EU treaty and undermine one of the blocâ€™s fundamental principles â€” that all members act in unison on trade matters.â€œI would rather deal just with France,â€? Trump said at the White House on April 24, before a visit by Macron. â€œThe Union is very tough for us. They have trade barriers that are unacceptable.â€?David Oâ€™Sullivan, the European Union ambassador to the United States, said that if tariffs go into effect, â€œwe are back to the need to pursue this with the World Trade Organization, including the possibility of imposing rebalancing counter-tariffs on equivalent U.S. exports.â€?The EU has already drawn up a list of products targeted for retaliation. They are meant to inflict maximum pain on the Republican heartland, including recreational power boats made in Tennessee, digital flight recorders made in Arizona and playing cards made in Kentucky.But the strategy may not be effective. Business leaders who have visited Washington recently said that the president had been unmoved by protests from members of his own party.Together, the countries seeking to extend temporary exemptions account for about half of American steel imports. The United States has already granted South Korea a permanent exemption as part of negotiations over a revised trade deal.Other countries have already been denied exemptions and started paying tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. They include China and Russia as well as Japan, a close ally.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan refused to be coerced into one-on-one negotiations, instead trying to coax the United States back into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multicountry trade deal Trump left last year.â€œThe United States is interested in a bilateral deal,â€? Abe said during a news conference after a meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida in mid-April. â€œOur countryâ€™s position is that TPP is best for both of the countries, and based on that position we will be approaching the talks.â€?Trump was not persuaded. After briefly considering rejoining the trade agreement, he reversed course, writing on Twitter that the deal had â€œtoo many contingencies.â€?American negotiators appear to be trying to persuade countries to restrain their own metal shipments voluntarily â€” without retaliating against the United States or suing the country in international courts. But few countries appear eager to play along.For Canada and Mexico, among the largest exporters of steel and aluminum to the United States, the Trump administration has tied their exemptions to NAFTA talks. Negotiators from the three countries are scheduled to meet again on May 7 as they push to work through the major remaining disagreements and announce a revised pact.Canadian and Mexican negotiators played down the risk of the tariffs on Friday, suggesting that applying trade penalties in the meantime could sink the talks. Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign minister, said that the steel and aluminum tariffs were a â€œcompletely separate issueâ€? from the trade deal and that there was â€œno justification whatsoeverâ€? for trade barriers against Canada.The direct impact of the tariffs on world trade, assuming they take effect, will be minimal, economists say. Though steel plays a big role in the public imagination, it accounts for a sliver of global commerce.Economists are more worried that a trade war will escalate, disrupting international supply chains and sending shock waves around the world. Many of the effects will be difficult to predict.â€œWhen two elephants fight,â€? said Miguel Ponce, head of Argentinaâ€™s Center for the Study of Foreign Trade in the 21st Century, â€œit is the grass that suffers the most.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But Jim Hagedorn, a former GOP congressional aide and Treasury official running for an open House seat, says they should keep their faith in Trump.'He understands just how important it is to these rural areas that we have these markets,' Hagedorn said in an interview at his campaign office. 'Do I understand that the president has the prerogative to go out and negotiate? Of course I do. But I trust that in the end, he's going to do everything possible to make sure that we help everyone in the United States, including our farmers.'Trump's aggressive, lurching attacks on China over trade are putting Republicans like Hagedorn in a difficult spot - torn between siding with Trump while acknowledging the economic peril to many of their constituents. The issue presents yet another challenge to the GOP in a tough midterm election year even in the rural areas across the upper Midwest that swept Trump to victory - and where control of the Senate could be decided.When China threatened a 25 percent tariff on soybeans, Mike Petefish, who grows the crop over 2,000 acres, feared the worst. Soybeans are a $2 billion business in Minnesota.'A 40-cent drop in soybeans, like we saw on Wednesday, meant $50,000 of value evaporating out of my bottom line,' said Petefish, the 33-year-old president of the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association. 'The last time I talked to our banker, he told me that of all his clients â€” these are all farmers â€” only four made money last year. We kind of broke even. But this year was looking tough even before the tariffs.'In Minnesota's 1st congressional District, six-term Democratic Rep. Tim Walz is retiring to run for governor, opening up a seat Trump won by 15 points. Hagedorn, 65, is considered the best GOP candidate to turn a blue seat red.A third of the state's soybean crop comes from the district. It also is home to Martin County, the top hog-producing county in the state and one that has been dubbed the 'Bacon Capital of the World.' China's tariffs on pork will hit hard too.Trump's March 1announcement of new tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum had been popular, especially after the quiet carve-outs for Mexico and Canada. Democrats in Minnesota's 8th district, where thousands of iron miners live and work, had embraced the tariffs; they'd done the same in Illinois' 12th district, where U.S. Steel reacted to Trump by reopening a plant.The second wave of the trade war has complicated the political outlook for Republican candidates in rural races. Last year, after Wisconsin's 3rd district swung from a 11-point Obama seat to a 5-point Trump seat, the National Republican Congressional Committee added Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., to their targets for 2018.But the party's candidate, Steve Toft, raised just $66,015 in 2017, compared with $1,163,935 for Kind. The seat, which borders Minnesota's 1st district, had been moving away from Republicans even before the tariffs - which Toft did not support.'That's not really free markets. I think the president intends to strengthen the steel industry â€” and we probably need to do that â€” but it's probably not going to help the people in this district,' Toft said.Officially, Trump's party is giving candidates a pass on the trade war. 'Candidates and members will support policies based on what's best for their districts,' said National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Jesse Hunt.For much of 2017, Republicans sought to portray Democrats as unhinged by the president, obsessed with scandal. The trade war has allowed rural Democrats to pivot, advocating stability against a backdrop of threats and confusion.In the midst of the latest tariff announcements, Kind held three town hall meetings, where farmers from the dairy, corn, and soybean industries pleaded for relief.'It's going to hurt American farmers, no doubt about it,' said Jarous Valenec, a 43-year old dairy farmer who attended one town hall. 'We were already looking at depressed prices for corn and soybeans, before this. There's no sector that's showing good numbers.'Joseph Zenz, 52, a cash crop farmer in southwest Wisconsin, said the panic over prices might have been 'a knee-jerk reaction' to something that negotiations could settle.'China still needs our product. China still needs soybeans,' said Zenz. 'But every year seems to get more challenging. More competition. Prices keep getting higher. Farmland keeps getting more expensive.'But like many farmers, Valence and Zenz had supported Trump for president. Clinton, explained Zenz, had 'nothing to offer' to people who had struggled in the final years of Obama's presidency.Weeks into the trade war, Trump's alternative seemed to be chaos.'Yeah, China has been cheating,' said Kind in an interview. 'Now's the time to build an international coalition to stand up to them, not to go it alone. That's just going to invite the kind of retaliation that we saw this week.'Republicans in agricultural states were sounding the same notes as Kind, and openly questioning the administration's handling of the fallout. Several asked what Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue had meant last month when he suggested 'mitigation' on behalf of farmers if a trade war broke out.On Wednesday, Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., whom the president had personally recruited to run for Senate this year, urged Perdue to use every tool 'to protect ag producers from effects resulting in potential trade actions against China.'In Wisconsin, where two Republicans are fighting for the nomination against Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., candidate Kevin Nicholson delighted Democrats by telling a local news channel that farmers might have to put up with 'risk.''We've made so many mistakes to get to this point that it's going to involve some amount of risk to undo it,' said Nicholson. 'The president's objective is clearly a world without tariffs.'Unlike Republicans, who risk alienating their base when criticizing the president, Democrats have plunged into the fray. In the 1st district, where five Democrats are competing to replace Walz, each candidate quickly condemned the administration for launching a trade war on TV instead of using the low-key â€” but less disruptive â€” tools available in the World Trade Organization.'There's such uncertainty in ag in the first place,' said Dan Feehan, an Army veteran who served in the Obama administration and led the field in fundraising. 'Negotiating tactics, in my view, are done in the form of a negotiation. When you're making policy, you start with everyone at the table talking through their concerns. Otherwise, you don't know what the other side is thinking, and it turns into a very dark situation.'Joe Sullivan, a green energy advocate running to Feehan's left, called the trade war 'a completely self-inflicted wound.'Republicans, who had convinced farmers to abandon the Democrats, said that they could win the argument before November. Hagedorn argued that any Democratic victory could restore the policies of the Obama era, including regulations on water use and pollution that many farmers had despised.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Americaâ€™s government declares â€œwarâ€? promiscuously â€” on poverty, on drugs, on cancer, etc. â€” except when actually going to war, which the nation has done often since it last declared war (on June 5, 1942, on Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary). But the incipient war du jour is being postponed. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says the Trump administration is â€œputting the trade war on hold.â€? The one with China, that is. Others can continue.The armistice-before-the-war is good news for farmers, who could use some. USA Today reports that the net income of U.S. farmers has fallen by more than half since 2013, to its lowest point since 2006, the steepest decline since the Depression. For this, blame productive farming around the world (supply outpacing demand), rotten weather in America, and perverse government in Washington. China and Mexico, responding to uncertainties caused by U.S. indignation (about China selling too much to consenting American adults, and about NAFTA enabling mighty Mexico to exploit America), are finding alternative sources of soybeans, pork and beef.There is nothing like a calamity for taking oneâ€™s mind off oneâ€™s troubles, and anti-immigration Republicans have another affliction for American farmers. The Wall Street Journal reports that about half of agriculture workers are undocumented immigrants. Because more Mexicans have left than entered the United States between 2009 and 2014, the immigrant agriculture labor force is aging â€” and moving to higher-paying construction jobs. The Journal: â€œAs farmers struggle to find workers, more production has moved abroad. Avocado imports have doubled over the last eight years while U.S. production (measured by acreage) has declined by about a quarter. Since 1999, domestic production has fallen for oranges (by 36 percent), grapefruits (61 percent) and asparagus (69 percent). Imports of fresh fruits and vegetables have swelled. â€¦ This hurts workers in related industries like transportation and food processing.â€? This is the Republicansâ€™ approach to succoring â€œvictims of globalization.â€?Simultaneously, the administrationâ€™s protectionism is further increasing the cost of homeownership with tariffs on imported Canadian lumber (framing lumber is about 18 percent of the average new homeâ€™s selling price). Bloomberg Businessweek says this adds an average of $1,360 to the cost of building a single-family home, the price of which has risen $6,388 since January 2017.Not content with bossing around Americans, the administrationâ€™s protectionists have demanded that Mexico, as part of a renegotiated NAFTA, institute a $16 minimum wage for Mexican factory workers. So, a Republican administration purports to know more than Mexicoâ€™s labor market knows about the proper price of Mexican labor.All this dictating and renegotiating is supposed to protect American jobs from the menace of NAFTA, which according to one of its ardent critics destroyed 1 million U.S. jobs in its first 20 years (1994-2014). An academic study argues that trade with China destroyed 2.4 million jobs between 1999 and 2011. But Don Boudreaux of George Mason Universityâ€™s Mercatus Center says this means it took NAFTA two decades to destroy as many jobs as are erased by the normal churning of the American job market on average every 18 days. And the so-called â€œChina shockâ€? eliminated in 13 years as many jobs as are eliminated by the U.S. economyâ€™s process of creative destruction, on average, every 41 days. So, if there are to be trade â€œwarsâ€? with China and Mexico, they will be launched to avenge job â€œcasualtiesâ€? that are far fewer than those routinely inflicted by the domestic processes that produce American prosperity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"DailyFX.com -Talking Points:The protectionist threats escalated over the weekend as Trump and the EU traded next steps, while NAFTA was used as further leverageAn uncertain but notably anti-EU lean to the Italian elections hasn't led to a 'de-risking' of the Euro with the ECB still aheadIf you aren't already, keep tabs on the British Pound, Canadian and Australian Dollars as event risk, themes and cross winds buildWhat makes for a 'great' trader? Strategy is important but there are many ways we can analyze to good trades. The most important limitations and advances are found in our own psychology. Download the DailyFX Building Confidence in Trading and Traits of Successful Traders guides to learn how to set your course from the beginning.Trade War Threats GrowLast week, we ended with trade wars as the most pressing threat to global financial stability. And, if we were to go by market activity, it would seem that that pressure had eased over the weekend. Looking to US equity indices, the S&P 500 and Dow led a notably robust rebound on the day with other risk-sensitive assets following in in tow. Yet, if we took stock of the rhetoric surrounding these troubling theme; the risks have actually grown since last week. Not only has US President Donald Trump not backed down from his threats to implement a 25 percent tariff on all imported steel and 10 percent on all aluminum, but he has further moved on to stake out the response to certain retaliations taken against the United States for such action. In particular, the European Union - one of the largest economies in the world - has said it is ready to respond with various taxes on US goods that it imports. If taken though, President Trump said his next target could be European autos. This is not a situation that seems to be cooling off. Quite the opposite.Markets Continue to Dance Along the EdgeSo, if the fundamental backdrop has grown increasingly precarious, why are assets attuned to speculative bearings not sliding in a de-escalation of risk exposure? We could have said the same as concerns of moderating growth rose, as global monetary policy started turned towards normalization and previous protectionist shifts were made. This is caught up in the same complacency with which speculators have fallen back on repeatedly over the past months and years. These are not conditions for which maintaining - much less expanding - an excessive risk exposure is wise. Is this evidence to the depths of complacency, confidence that the President will not follow through with his threats, or an assumption that 'trade really doesn't matter that much'? Whether this or another basis, these are exceptionally unrealistic and complacent means of justification for dangerous risk exposure. Traders (and particularly investors) should beware.Euro Kicks off Another Protectionist FrontAnother key headline and remarkable market restraint to start off the new trading week was the Italian election results and the response from the Euro. As expected, the outcome was inconclusive and ultimately ominous. There was no clear leader among the parties and the mix of possible coalitions were not particularly comforting for European or global markets. The top showing was for EU-skeptic Five-Star Movement with a projected 32 percent of the vote while the ruling Democratic Party lost traction. A former PM Berlusconi brokered center-right coalition comprised of Forza Italia, the far-right League and neo-fascist Brothers of Italy has the biggest share at 35.5 percent. Most of the working governing coalition formations seem to have at least a moderate degree of anti-EU sentiment behind them. Under certain conditions, the sentiment could be extreme. This is a systemic threat to the Euro, and yet the currency remained eerily calm. Perhaps this is in anticipation of the ECB, but that would be very risky hold out for bulls in an already over-optimistic position for the Euro.Other Themes and Other VictimsEquities, Dollar and Euro aren't the only assets facing heady fundamental winds. There are equally remarkable themes, events and even more impressive market moves in the global markets. Where tariffs and protectionism seems to be drawing a shrug from many of the assets at the center of the headlines, the Canadian Dollar seems under no illusion that it will be unaffected. With USD/CAD charging through 1.2900 and other Loonie crosses pushing to more remarkable extremes, it is clear to see the market appreciates it is the unfortunate victim to much of these developments. For the Pound, the Brexit uncertainties continue to churn, though conditions are not as positive as the GBP/USD or EUR/GBP seem to insinuate. And, in a week rife in high profile event risk, we continue the run with the RBA rate decision ahead. No change or clear guidance is a decision that stands out in our present backdrop.

Rao GuiheChina is aiming to boost domestic production of soybeans by calling on its vast army of farmers to expand soybean acreage and offering greater subsidies to growers such as Rao. It is also diversifying imports away from America.Since China opened up its economy to global trade in 2001, it has taken advantage of cheap imports of soybeans from the U.S. and other countries.But after the U.S. hiked tariffs on an initial batch of $34 billion of Chinese goods on Friday, China retaliated with matching tariffs on an equal amount of U.S. imports â€” including soybeans.Analysts say the crop was chosen because of the political pain it can cause Trump supporters in his political heartland.China recently also announced zero tariffs on soybeans from India, Bangladesh and other Asian countries.Beijing is the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, importing some $14 billion last year â€” or about two-thirds of American farm exports to China.Bottles are filled with soybean oil made from the U.S. imported soybeans on a production line at a plant in Qufu, China, on July 4. Jason Lee / Reuters'Take a day without meat, but not a day without beans' is a well-known Chinese saying, and cheap U.S. soybeans are processed into products from cooking oil to pig feed. China is home to half of the worldâ€™s pigs.â€œSometimes, I think a trade war with the U.S. is a mistake, but it will be nice if the government is willing to subsidize us â€” the more, the better,â€? Rao, 46, told NBC News.His cooperative of seven farmers has shifted most of its 2,400 acres of land to soybeans in response to the government's appeal.â€œOur farmers really hope that China will import less soybeans so that domestic soybean production and soybean-related businesses will flourish,â€? said Yang Guiyun, the sales manager of an agricultural company in Bayan County in Heilongjiang Province, an area that is Chinaâ€™s largest soybean producer.A key part of Chinaâ€™s new â€œgreat food strategy,â€? as analyst Zhengyuan Bo described it, is to boost domestic production.Beijing is the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, importing some $14 billion last year. Tom Gannam / Reuters fileAs part of the plan, China aims to add 1.6 million acres to its existing soybean acreage of 21 million. The government is also offering subsidies ranging from $190 to $320 per acre, compared to $150 previously. Local media reports have described the drive as a â€œpolitical priority.â€?Harbin-based agricultural manager Cao Guangxing said that the market price of soybeans has been kept low by imports, meaning many farmers have focused on other crops. â€œWithout subsidy, we wonâ€™t grow soybeans,' Cao added.Rao, the farmer, singled out American produce. â€œItâ€™s the genetically modified U.S. soybeans that are depressing prices,' he said.Wang Erda, a professor at the Dalian University of Technology who has researched agricultural economics in U.S. farming states, said that it was important for China to boost its 'self-reliance and develop other sources of imports.''China has no choice but to play hard ball, too,' he added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings./ Updated By Associated PressBEIJING â€” China slammed the U.S. threat to expand tariff hikes to imports including apples, fish sticks and French doors as a 'totally unacceptable' escalation of their trade battle on Wednesday and vowed to protect its 'core interests.'The Trump administration raised the stakes in the growing trade dispute, threatening 10 percent tariffs on a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, sending stocks lower and prompting Beijing to warn it would be forced to respond.China's commerce ministry said it was 'shocked' and would complain to the World Trade Organisation, but did not immediately say how it would retaliate.Beijing has said it would hit back against Washington's escalating tariff measures, including through 'qualitative measures,' a threat that U.S. businesses in China fear could mean anything from stepped-up inspections to delays in investment approvals and even consumer boycotts.The spiraling conflict over Chinese technology policy threatens to chill global economic growth. It stems from Washington's belief that Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology and worries that plans for state-led development of Chinese champions in robots and other fields might erode American industrial leadership.The U.S. Trade Representative announced the possible second round of tariff hikes on Tuesday targeting a $200 billion list of Chinese goods ranging from burglar alarms to mackerel. That came four days after Washington added 25 percent duties on $34 billion of Chinese goods and Beijing responded by increasing its own taxes on the same amount of American imports.'For over a year, the Trump administration has patiently urged China to stop its unfair practices, open its market, and engage in true market competition,' Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in announcing the proposed tariffs.'Rather than address our legitimate concerns, China has begun to retaliate against U.S. products ... There is no justification for such action,' he said in a statement.Some U.S. business groups and lawmakers from Trump's own Republican Party were critical of the escalating tariffs.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said the announcement 'appears reckless and is not a targeted approach.'Beijing's lopsided trade balance with the United States means it will quickly run out of imports for retaliation. China imported U.S. goods worth $130 billion last year and Friday's tariff hike hit $34 billion of that, with another $16 billion cited for a possible increase.China 'cannot match fresh U.S. tariffs,' Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank said in a report.Instead, its heavily regulated economy gives Beijing tools to disrupt operations for American automakers, restaurant chains and other companies that are looking to China to drive revenue growth. Regulators can deny or cancel licenses or tie up companies by launching tax, environmental or anti-monopoly investigations.China's exports have mushroomed since it joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001, making it the world's second-largest economy and prompting widening criticism in recent years from trading partners that it has unfairly used global trade rules to its advantage.As its dispute with Washington deepened, Beijing has been calling on other countries to support global free trade and has talked up efforts to ease investment rules. During a visit to Germany this week by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, the countries signed business deals worth more than $23 billion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings./ Updated By Associated PressTORONTO â€” Canada announced billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. on Friday in a tit-for-tat response to the Trump administration's duties on Canadian steel and aluminum.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government released the final list of items that will be targeted beginning July 1. Some items will be subject to taxes of 10 or 25 percent.Trudeau and President Donald Trump spoke late Friday, in what may have been their first direct conversation since Trump tweeted that Trudeau was 'weak' and 'dishonest' after leaving the G-7 meetings in Quebec earlier this month.'As he has said in past conversations and in public, the Prime Minister conveyed that Canada has had no choice but to announce reciprocal countermeasures to the steel and aluminum tariffs that the United States imposed on June 1, 2018,' Trudeau's office said in a statement.'The two leaders agreed to stay in close touch on a way forward.'Trudeau also spoke to Mexican President Enrique Pena Neito and updated him on Canada's response to the U.S. tariffs.The taxes on items including ketchup, lawn mowers and motor boats amount to $12.6 billion.'We will not escalate and we will not back down,' Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said.Freeland said they had no other choice and called the tariffs regrettable.Many of the U.S. products were chosen for their political rather than economic impact. For example, Canada imports just $3 million worth of yogurt from the U.S. annually and most of it comes from one plant in Wisconsin, the home state of House Speaker Paul Ryan. The product will now be hit with a 10 percent duty.'This is a perfectly reciprocal action,' Freeland said. 'It is a dollar for dollar response.'Another product on the list is whiskey, which comes from Tennessee and Kentucky, the latter of which is the home state of Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell.Freeland also said they are prepared if Trump escalates the trade war.'It is absolutely imperative that common sense should prevail,' she said. 'Having said that our approach from day one of the NAFTA negotiations has been to hope for the best but prepare for the worst.'Trump has explained the steel and aluminum tariffs by saying imported metals threatened the United States' national security â€” a justification that countries rarely use because it can be so easily abused. He is also threatening to impose another national security-based tariff on imported cars, trucks and auto parts. That threat could be a negotiating ploy to restart talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement.Freeland said there are no grounds for further U.S. tariffs in response to Canada's actions.Canadians are particularly worried about auto tariffs because the industry is critical to Canada's economy. Freeland said such tariffs would be 'absurd' because the North American auto industry is highly integrated and parts made in Canada often go to cars manufactured in the U.S. and then sold back to Canadians. 'Any trade action is disruptive on both sides of the border,' Freeland said.Freeland said an 'intensive phase' of NAFTA renegotiations will resume quickly after Sunday's elections in Mexico.'I don't think we'll see any reaction from the Trump administration. They are prepared for this,' said Dan Ujczo, a trade lawyer in Columbus, Ohio. 'Candidly, the Canadian retaliation is a drop in the bucket compared to the retaliation that we're going to see from China and elsewhere.'Ujczo doubts Trump will announce auto tariffs because that would be a 'red line for the U.S. Congress' before the midterm election.The U.S. Department of Commerce is holding hearings on auto tariffs in late July and will subsequently release an investigative report about whether they threaten national security.'I don't think Congress right now is expected to get engaged until after the midterm election. They've given the president a long leash and will continue to do so. The auto tariffs would disrupt that. It would change the calculus,' Ujczo said.The Canadian government also announced $1.5 billion in subsidies for Canada's steel and aluminum industries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings./ Updated By Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie DannWASHINGTON â€” Out of all the news from Thursday â€” President Trumpâ€™s controversial pardon of conservative provocateur Dinesh Dâ€™Souza, the possible upcoming pardons of Martha Stewart and Rod Blagojevich, and the ongoing preparations for a summit with North Korea â€” was an even bigger story: Trumpâ€™s trade war with U.S. allies.Citing protecting national security interests, the United States slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union, and those nations said they would retaliate in kind. â€œCanadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland announced $12.8 billion in retaliatory tariffs, which she called â€˜the strongest trade action Canada has taken in the post-war era,â€™â€? per NBC News. â€œWithin minutes of the American action, Mexico had detailed a list of goods to target for retaliation, including steel, pork, apples, cranberries and cheeses,â€? the New York Times adds. â€œCecilia MalmstrÃ¶m, the EU trade commissioner, is also expected to announce retaliatory tariffs on classic American products, such as Leviâ€™s jeans, bourbon whiskey, cranberries and peanut butter, at a press conference later on Friday,â€? the Guardian reports.And Trumpâ€™s trade war â€” ostensibly to give him leverage in the NAFTA renegotiations with Canada and Mexico â€” represents a gigantic gamble for the president. Right now, the state of the U.S. economy (3.9 percent unemployment rate, steady overall job growth) has politically been the best thing going for Trump.But does the uncertainty from a trade war â€” plus higher overall prices for manufacturers and consumers â€” endanger the state of the U.S. economy, at least in the medium to long term?â€œOverall, the idea of imposing tariffs to help the steel and aluminum industries is really misguided,â€? Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America, told NBC News. â€œThis will lead to a decline in overall economic activity.â€?North adds that the roughly 150,000 jobs that could potentially be saved in those industries is dwarfed by the nearly 2 million jobs at risk in industries that use imported steel and aluminum. â€œThose expenses will not only destroy jobs, but flow through to consumers.â€?Canadaâ€™s Trudeau says Pence demand blew up NAFTA negotiationsMeanwhile, â€œCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said months of intense negotiations between his country, the United States and Mexico imploded Tuesday when Vice President Pence demanded that any deal expire automatically in five years,â€? the Washington Post writes. â€œTrudeau said he was prepared to travel to Washington this week to try to finalize a rework of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but Pence, in the phone call, said a meeting would occur only if the â€œsunsetâ€? provision was agreed to in advance.â€?â€œâ€˜I had to highlight that there was no possibility of any Canadian prime minister signing a NAFTA deal that included a five-year sunset clause, and obviously the visit didnâ€™t happen,â€™ Trudeau said Thursday.â€?Kushner friend now under scrutiny from MuellerNBCâ€™s Carol Lee and Julia Ainsley: â€œA close friend of Jared Kushner has come under scrutiny by Special Counsel Robert Mueller for his proximity to some key meetings between Trump associates and foreign officials, according to five people familiar with the matter. Richard Gerson, a hedge-fund manager in New York, was in the Seychelles in January 2017, less than two weeks before President Donald Trump's inauguration and around the time Trump associate Erik Prince secretly met with Russian and United Arab Emirates officials, including Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, four of the people said.â€?More: While in the remote Indian Ocean island nation, Gerson met with Prince Mohammed â€” also known by his initials as MBZ â€” and communicated with a Lebanese-American businessman with close ties to the UAE, George Nader, who had organized the Erik Prince meeting, according to text messages Gerson sent at the time and a person familiar with the meeting. Gerson had met Nader just weeks earlier when Trump officials, including Kushner, gathered for a secret meeting with MBZ at a Four Seasons hotel in New York, four people familiar with the meeting said. Trump's incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn and chief political adviser Steve Bannon, as well as the UAE's ambassador to the U.S., Yousef Otaiba, also attended the meeting. Gerson's presence in the Seychelles and at the Four Seasons meeting has not been previously reported.Pompeo cites progress in talks with North Koreaâ€œSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday that progress had been made toward salvaging a historic summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, calling it a â€˜once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change the course for the world,â€™â€? the Washington Post says. â€œAfter more than two hours of formal talks with Kimâ€™s right-hand aide, Vice Chairman Kim Yong Chol, Pompeo spoke as though the summit Trump canceled last week was likely to be reinstated, though he still framed it as an â€˜expectedâ€™ first meeting.â€?More: â€œKim Yong Chol will travel to Washington on Friday to deliver a â€˜personal letterâ€™ from the North Korean leader, Pompeo said, adding that he does not know whether that means a formal announcement is likely that the summit is back on.â€?In addition to Californiaâ€™s â€œTop 2â€? contests, here are the other primary races to watch on TuesdayWhile the marquee June 5 primaries weâ€™ll be watching are all in California â€” CA-GOV, CA-SEN, CA-39, CA-48, CA-49 â€” there are other contests that will be worth paying attention to on Tuesday when eight states hold their primaries.

"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings./ Updated / Source: ReutersWASHINGTON â€” The U.S. trade war with China is 'on hold' after the world's largest economies agreed to drop their tariff threats while they work on a wider trade agreement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday.Mnuchin and U.S. President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the agreement reached by Chinese and American negotiators on Saturday set up a framework for addressing trade imbalances in the future.'We are putting the trade war on hold. Right now, we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework,' Mnuchin said in a television interview on 'Fox News Sunday.'On Saturday, Beijing and Washington said they would keep talking about measures under which China would import more energy and agricultural commodities from the United States to close the $335 billion annual U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China.During an initial round of talks this month in Beijing, Washington demanded that China reduce its trade surplus by $200 billion. No dollar figure was cited in the countries' joint statement on Saturday.The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return a request for comment on Mnuchin's statement.Kudlow told CBS 'Face the Nation' it was too soon to lock in the $200 billion figure. 'The details will be down the road. These things are not so precise,' he said.Beijing agreed to take measures to substantially reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China and offered to make structural reforms, such as lowering tariffs and non-tariff barriers, that will allow the United States to export goods worth billions of dollars more, Kudlow said earlier on ABC's 'This Week.'Trump was in a 'very positive mood about this,' Kudlow said.However, he said there was no trade deal reached.'There's no agreement for a deal,' Kudlow told ABC. 'We never anticipated one. There's a communique between the two great countries, that's all. And in that communique, you can see where we're going next.'One next step will be dispatching Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to China to look at areas where there will be significant increases, including energy, liquefied natural gas, agriculture and manufacturing, Mnuchin and Kudlow said.Mnuchin said the United States expects to see a big increase of between 35 percent and 40 percent in agricultural exports to China this year alone and a doubling of energy purchases over the next three to five years.'We have specific targets. I am not going to publicly disclose what they are. They go industry by industry,' Mnuchin said.Saturday's statement made no mention of whether there would be a relaxation of paralyzing restrictions on Chinese telecommunications equipment maker ZTE Corp imposed last month by the U.S. Commerce Department.The action was related to violation of U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea and banned American companies from selling semiconductors and other components to ZTE, causing the Shenzhen-based company to cease operations.Trump said last week he had directed Ross to put ZTE back in business, but Kudlow said any changes would be minimal.'If any of the remedies are altered they are still going to be very, very, tough, including big fines, compliance measures, new management, new boards,' he said. 'Do not expect ZTE to get off scot-free. Ain't going to happen.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings./ Updated By Benjy SarlinWASHINGTON â€” President Donald Trump signed proclamations Thursday imposing new tariffs on imported steel and imported aluminum as he made good on years of fiery threats to confront allies and rivals alike on trade policy.Trump's plan has unsettled stock markets and scrambled political alliances, with Republican leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin criticizing the tariffs and Democrats like Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio talking them up. Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, who reportedly opposed the tariffs, resigned over the issue.The large tariffs, which take effect March 23 and include exceptions for Canada and Mexico, will impact the American economy and could touch off a trade war, with other countries already threatening to respond in kind. The European Union has already prepared a list of U.S. goods that will see higher tariffs in Europe.Here's what you need to know.What is Trump doing?The president is imposing a tariff of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports.The president's tariff initiative comes after the Commerce Department, led by Secretary Wilbur Ross, released a report declaring that current levels of steel and aluminum imports threatened national security and recommending tariffs and quotas on imports to protect the industries at home. Under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, the White House can take action to confront such threats, but it's been invoked only rarely to confront oil crises in the 1970s and '80s.Who do tariffs help?The immediate beneficiaries are likely steel and aluminum companies, which will now be able to sell their product at cheaper prices in the U.S. relative to foreign competitors. U.S. Steel announced it would send 500 idled workers to an Illinois plant in response to Trump's plan.The industry has long complained that it's been undermined by overproduction of steel in China, which the Commerce Department says is 'by far' the largest contributor toward 700 million tons of excess steel capacity worldwide. While China represents only a small fraction of steel imports to America, critics say it and other countries distort the global market by subsidizing cheap steel in order to build up their industry at home and muscle out rivals abroad.'We put those duties in place and we can help industries recover,' Robert Scott, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute who is broadly supportive of the tariffs, told NBC News. 'It leads to more investment, it leads to increasing employment.'Who gets hurt?Companies that rely on steel and aluminum to make their products, from auto manufacturers to construction firms, will face higher costs that could cause them to raise prices or cut jobs. Beer companies, which use aluminum in their cans, are livid.Since there are vastly more businesses that use steel and aluminum rather than produce it (the American Iron and Steel Institute estimates there are 140,000 jobs in the industry), most economists expect the tariffs to hurt growth, if only modestly.But the bigger fear for the economy isn't the tariffs â€” it's what other countries might do in response and whether it leads to a broader trade war.What's a 'trade war'?Trade is based on reciprocity.

Trump, who said recently that 'trade wars are good' on Twitter, has already threatened Europe with a tax on imported autos in response.'If it does get out of hand to some degree, where there's tit-for-tat with a lot of countries, it will have some impact on the economy,' said Claude Barfield, a trade policy scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.In addition to affecting goods that are hit with tariffs, the uncertainty created by a trade war could spook investors, who worry about fallout.

"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings./ Updated By Benjy SarlinWASHINGTON â€” President Donald Trump signed proclamations Thursday imposing new tariffs on imported steel and imported aluminum as he made good on years of fiery threats to confront allies and rivals alike on trade policy.Trump's plan has unsettled stock markets and scrambled political alliances, with Republican leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin criticizing the tariffs and Democrats like Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio talking them up. Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, who reportedly opposed the tariffs, resigned over the issue.The large tariffs, which take effect March 23 and include exceptions for Canada and Mexico, will impact the American economy and could touch off a trade war, with other countries already threatening to respond in kind.

"Take the case of Appleâ€™s muted decision in 2017 to comply with a sweeping new Chinese data security regulation. The regulation required any company holding data on Chinese citizens to localize a data center in China in partnership with a Chinese technology firm and be subject to security reviews by the local authorities. The rule was clearly a violation of Chinese citizens' autonomy, and yet the powerful creator of iPhones, MacBooks and iPads complied quickly â€” presumably because Apple has a tremendously large share of the local consumer market and a massive manufacturing base in China.Apple is not alone, however, in making policy determinations driven largely by considerations involving foreign actors. Consider, for example, the U.S. governmentâ€™s continued concern about the ability of terrorists like ISIS to recruit and radicalize via social media. One step that would make those platforms less hospitable for terrorists would be to prohibit use via virtual private networks (VPNs). VPNs mask a userâ€™s computer and thus provide anonymity to users who want to cover their tracks.Itâ€™s hard to imagine U.S.-based users of, say Twitter, really suffering if they couldnâ€™t post on Twitter via VPNs, even if some might bemoan the loss of additional privacy. But social media companies are not merely concerned with the experience for U.S.-based users; Companies want users living abroad, including dissidents living under authoritarian regimes, to be able to Tweet, message and upload freely as well. These users argue that they need VPNs, making anonymity possible for terrorists, too. Some think thatâ€™s the right balance and some donâ€™t, but either way it represents a policy call with repercussions for national security that is being based in significant part on non-American considerations.Will companies be able to produce U.S. jobs and boost U.S. economic growth, even as they respond to the economic and development demands of their increasingly foreign user base?The broader theme here is the powerful tension that exists between commercial and other interests of Silicon Valleyâ€™s leading firms â€” all of which are in pursuit of greater global reach, both for profit and for sheer ambition â€” and the protection of U.S. security.We canâ€™t cover all of the potential threats to U.S. national security in this piece, but itâ€™s worth noting a few others. One is intelligence collection: Will companies be able to provide communications that U.S. law enforcement and the intelligence officials need to keep Americans safe? This is a complex question that implicates encryption (a passion of many foreign-based users of WhatsApp and similar services), data localization and a host of related issues.A second, at times countervailing consideration is privacy: Will companies respect the privacy interests of users abroad when foreign governments expect a level of intrusion that would never fly with American users?A third aspect involves long-term American economic security: Will companies be able to produce U.S. jobs and boost U.S. economic growth, even as they respond to the economic and development demands of their increasingly foreign user base?Comparing the U.S. governmentâ€™s approach to Silicon Valley with the approach of foreign governments reveals that those foreign governments are often, in key respects, more directly engaged than Washington is.Comparing the U.S. governmentâ€™s approach to Silicon Valley with the approach of foreign governments reveals that those foreign governments are often, in key respects, more directly engaged than Washington is. Foreign governments are more attentive to the negative externalities the firms leading this industry have generated, as well as their implications for public policy.That doesnâ€™t mean, of course, that their approach to handling new technologies is superior; cases like Franceâ€™s Minitel demonstrate that a heavy-handed approach to industrial policy can fail quite dramatically. But the fact that other governments are more deliberate and more coordinated in their strategies for mass democratization of the internet â€” often through multinational entities such as the European Union â€” seems to call for increased attention by Washington to protect American national security interests.Ultimately, this means we need better U.S. global leadership â€” something which we fear President Donald Trump's administration is abdicating. Europe, not the United States, has at least tried to take a significant step toward tackling key technology-related challenges through the Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that went into effect in May.So far, Facebook seems committed to applying voluntarily at least certain GDPR principles in the United States â€” because the U.S. government has been unable to figure out what it wants. That's a good step, presumably. But, without better leadership broadly, Silicon Valley will drift away and the United States will suffer.Joshua A.

"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn +China and the US entered into a new stage in their ongoing import tax tit-for-tat on April 4 when Beijing announced that it would impose a stiff 25% tariff on over 100 US products in retaliation for US President Donald J. Trumpâ€˜s decision to single China out as the main target of his self-declared trade war.The new regulatory tax will target soybean and sorghum products, cotton, several types of wheat, orange juice, chemicals, corn products, whiskey, cigars, tobacco, beef, lubricants, propane, plastics, cars, and certain types of aircraft.Chinaâ€™s Commerce Ministry estimates the tariffs will affect â‚¬41 billion worth of imports from the US.Soybeans are the biggest agricultural export to China. The highly lucrative commodity is mostly used as animal feed and biofuel, of which the US controls 37% of the global production; 62% of which is exported to China.By singling out US soybean production, China has opted to strategically target agricultural regions controlled by Republicans as part of their response to Trumpâ€™s initial move to heavily tax Chinese products.Airplanes tariffs are also expected to politically damage the Trump administration as Boeing exports one in four of its planes to China. Airbus is expected to move in to fill the vacuum and gain the market share formally occupied by the USâ€™ aerospace industry.China is the worldâ€™s largest air travel market the biggest market for aircraft. Chinaâ€™s Eastern Airlines is Boeingâ€™s fifth biggest customer.The tariff on cars is likely to deliver a significant blow to General Motors, which sells 10% of its production to China, while the Ford Motor Company will also be affected as cars shipped to China account for 4% of its total exports.Washington initially listed 1,300 Chinese products to be hit by a 25% tariff. The isolationist and protectionist ideologues in the Trump administration claim the move was a coordinated response to the â€œunfairâ€? intellectual property rights practices, most prominently, pressure on US companies to share technology.The escalation of the trade dispute has shaken stock markets in the EU, UK, US, and China, while Beijing has opted to refer the US to the World Trade Organization for violating its rules.The US has an 18% share of Chinese exports.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Trading placesThis much is clear. On Friday, Donald Trump tweeted that â€œtrade wars are good, and easy to win.â€? On Monday, the president said, â€œI donâ€™t think youâ€™ll have a trade war.â€?Trump insisted he is â€œnot backing downâ€? on his plan to impose stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. He said that includes Canada and Mexico, unless they see things more Trumpâ€™s way on renegotiating NAFTA.But the White House is buying time â€” two weeks before the tariffs become official. Could the plan change? â€œWe havenâ€™t actually fully rolled out all of the details, so therefore it would be hard for me to say,â€? said press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Free-trade advocates remain worried. Through a spokeswoman, the usually Trump-pliant House Speaker Paul Ryan said, â€œWe are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan.â€?GOP leaders are even talking vaguely of finding a way to thwart Trump through legislation, though it would be difficult to put together veto-proof two-thirds majorities.But the stock market closed higher Monday, suggesting a steadying of nerves after last weekâ€™s freakout over trade war fears.

The transaction went through 12 days before the 2016 election. After Trumpâ€™s victory, Cohen complained to friends that he had yet to be reimbursed, the report said.Whether Trump knew of the Daniels deal and reimbursed Cohen could affect a Federal Election Commission review of whether the arrangement violated campaign-finance law.Janison: Tunnel in a holeTrumpâ€™s move to block federal funding for the Gateway rail tunnel is the latest obstacle for the project, but hardly the first, writes Newsdayâ€™s Dan Janison.Even before Trump decided it would be a good way to punish Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the administration had scaled back its planned support.

An Associated Press fact-check found much that was â€œproblematicâ€? in Trumpâ€™s tweet.Wonâ€™t talk, wonâ€™t stop talkingItâ€™s fair to call Sam Nunberg disgruntled â€” with Trump, who fired him from a senior campaign post in the summer of 2015, and now with Robert Mueller. The special counsel, Nunberg says, has subpoenaed him for emails and to appear before a grand jury, but he wonâ€™t go.â€œLet him arrest me,â€? Nunberg said during a bizarre blitz of media interviews Monday. He said, without clear explanation, that based on questions he has received, he suspects Mueller has concluded Trump â€œmay have done somethingâ€? but â€œI could be wrong.â€?He said the special counsel wanted him to testify against his mentor, outside Trump adviser Roger Stone, who is â€œlike my father.â€? When a CNN anchor said she smelled alcohol on his breath, Nunberg said no, he was on antidepressants. Still later, he told The Associated Press he probably would cooperate with Mueller.POTUS: No chaos... you're chaos.This very orderly presidential tweet was issued at 7:55 a.m. Tuesday:'The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection).

"The Trump administration seems to think Jean-Claude Juncker will turn up for talks in Washington on Wednesday waving a white flag, handing an early victory to America in the trade war it launched against the European Union (E.U.).If so, officials are in for disappointment.President Trump wants the E.U. to fully open its market to American firms, removing all tariffs, barriers, and subsidies in a reciprocal deal. He believes the E.U. is â€œripping offâ€? America and cites the large goods trade deficit as evidence.Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council and one of Trumpâ€™s most senior advisers, said he understood the European Commission president will be â€œbringing a very important free trade offer,' CNBC reported.But European officials are angry. They accuse Trump of using tariffs that are illegal under World Trade Organization rules to bully it on trade and cannot understand why he would harm relations with such an important ally like this.Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesThe E.U., which tried to open up trade with America through the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a tricky deal scrapped by Trump, faces numerous political obstacles to doing what the president wants. Many interest groups and industries inside the E.U. fight opening its market to greater competition, demanding protectionist measures.â€œFew people expect major breakthroughs, myself included,â€? Barbara C. Matthews, nonresident senior fellow on the Atlantic Councilâ€™s global business and economics program, told Newsweek. â€œWe are very far away from the days when increased trade liberalization was on the table.â€?And, according to the European Commission, the E.U.â€™s bureaucratic arm, thereâ€™s nothing on the table at all. Margaritis Schinas, a Commission spokeswoman, told a news conference Monday that â€œthere are no offersâ€? and that the Trump-Juncker meeting â€œis a discussion, it is a dialogue,â€? Reuters reported. Kudlow apparently had bad information.Signs are that discussions will be fractious at best. In a speech to veterans in Kansas, Missouri, just a day before his meeting with Juncker, Trump mockingly suggested his threat of automobile tariffs had the E.U. eager for a meeting.â€œThey sound nice, but they're rough,â€? he said, calling the E.U. a â€œbig abuserâ€? on trade. â€œThey're all coming in to see me tomorrow. They're all coming to the White House. I said you have to change. They said they didn't want to change. I said OK, good, we're going to tariff your cars. They send millions of cars. Mercedes, all of them. BMW. So many cars.â€œI said we're going to have to tariff your cars. They said, 'When can we show up? When can we be there? Would tomorrow be OK?'. Oh folks. Stick with us, stick with us.â€?Matthews said the most possible material outcome of the Juncker-Trump meeting is a concession by the E.U. on its own automobile import tariffs. For example, the U.S. only imposes a 2.5 percent tariff on passenger cars from the E.U. Yet the E.U. charges a 10 percent tariff in the other direction. Trumpâ€™s plan is to address that imbalance.â€œSince so many European car vehicles are already manufactured inside the United States, and since the White House has already received so much heat for its recent treatment of European allies, the best that can be hoped for at this stage is that the two leaders agree on a much narrower application of the proposed tariffs,â€? Matthews said.â€œI would look for how the administration chooses to treat European Foreign Direct Investment and vehicles made by European companies inside the U.S. such as the BMW plant in South Carolina or the Mercedes plant in Alabama.â€œBut letâ€™s not confuse any such an outcome as a material expansion in free trade or trade liberalization.â€?The immediate deadlock is the issue on automobile tariffs. But Matthews said â€œthe more important strategic deadlockâ€? is on the services sector â€œwhere the U.S. and the E.U. have more shared interests.â€?According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the U.S. had a $147 billion deficit in goods trade with the E.U. during 2016. But in services, the U.S. had a $55 billion surplus.Services account for the bulk of both Americaâ€™s and the E.U.â€™s economies. Greater access to the European market for American service firms would boost the trade surplus that already exists.â€œThere is no indication from public statements that policymakers on either side currently seek to address services trade at this weekâ€™s meetings,â€? Matthews said, a missed opportunity to unlock potential economic growth.The context in which this trade war is being fought is Americaâ€™s domestic politics.Trump came to power on a campaign promising to put â€œAmerica firstâ€? and fight these battles on global trade, replacing the manufacturing jobs that disappeared in recent years and reviving the working class communities that died when the work went away.But Trumpâ€™s presidency is unpopular and weak. He has a tough battle to keep Republican control of Congress in the November midterms and could even face impeachment if he were to lose.His trade wars are most painful for his own voters, as retaliatory tariffs are targeted at products manufactured in states where support for him is strongest, such as whiskey, peanut butter, and motorcycles.In his Kansas speech, Trump urged supporters to be â€œpatientâ€? with his aggressive trade policy, aware that they are feeling its pinch. â€œWe're opening up markets, you watch what's going on. Just be a little patient,â€? Trump said.â€œThey're all aiming at anybody that likes me. And they have lobbyists like nobody has ever seen. They have the best lobbyists ever put together...These countries have been ripping us off for decades. It doesn't take a week. It takes a little longer. But we're going to get it done.â€?Trump is all-in with his trade policy and he is playing it up to his base. Anything less than total victory against the E.U. is not an option for him. And in any case, he faces little domestic pushback on his trade policy.â€œJuncker faces a very considerable uphill battle,â€? Dr. Leslie Vinjamuri, head of the U.S. and the Americas programme at Chatham House, a foreign affairs think-tank in London, told Newsweek.â€œTrump is very narrowly focused on the midterm elections and unwilling to invest much in a trade deal. He faces little effective domestic constraint or oppositionâ€”instead, Trump has support for his tariffs among Republican voters.â€œEven on Capitol Hill, few Republican senators have been willing to push back. The Republican Party is ceding the ground, creating a vacuum for those who support free trade to emerge and fill. But nobody is.â€œDemocrats are not the party of free trade. Businesses have been focused on tax cuts and regulatory issues, not trade. There is no natural constituency for free trade in U.S. politics.â€?Whatâ€™s more, targeting Trumpâ€™s base with tariffs may actually backfire on the E.U.â€œTrumpâ€™s base of supporters will likely read this as evidence that Trumpâ€™s core message is correct: Europe is not treating Americans fairly, that Europe is taking advantage of America,â€? Vinjamuri said. â€œOf course, if you see Trump as Americaâ€™s bully, then not standing up to tariffs is equally problematic.â€?If things go badly when Juncker meets Trump, and the trade war is set to intensify, how can we tell? Aside from a characteristic Twitter outburst by Trump, Matthews said a sign of escalation would be Europeans talking publicly after the meeting about Americaâ€™s 25 percent tariff on light trucks.â€œFew of these are produced in Europe for export to the U.S. market compared to cars,â€? she said. â€œBut increased public rhetoric on the protectionist treatment of light trucks is a sure indication that the trade talks are heading towards increased conflict.â€?Vinjamuri described Junckerâ€™s trip as â€œan exercise in diplomacy,â€? but the prospects arenâ€™t looking good for a resolution. â€œIt is important to keep talking, but the tariff wars seem likely to continue for now,â€? she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Trumpâ€™s trade war will add $3000 to the sticker-cost of Toyotaâ€™s best selling vehicles, especially pickup trucks and minivans, the company said.â€œA 25 percent tariff on automotive imports, which is just a tax on consumers, would increase the cost of every vehicle sold in the country,â€? Toyota said in a statement CNBC reported on Friday.Toyota reported record profits on Friday. Global net income at Toyota rose from $5.52 billion to $5.91 billion during its first quarter, but executives said on Friday that the increased tariffs could harm Toyotaâ€™s bottom line and negatively affect jobs.For example, CNBC notes, a Toyota Camry sedan, assembled in Kentucky, would cost an extra $1,800 if a 25 percent tariff took effect. A similar cost increase would be seen on the Tundra pickup and the Sienna minivan with an additional $2,800 and $3,000 added to the prices respectively. Fleet customers such as taxi companies, Uber, or Lyft would be affected by these increases as well.The Trump Administration has started a trade war with China and also has 25 percent tariffs on imports from Russia and Brazil. The initial tariffs the President imposed, on steel and aluminum, have now begun to affect the automobile industry.The administration has, in total, imposed several billion dollars worth of import taxes, according to Forbes. As other nations retaliate, to the tune of up to $105 billion in their own punitive trade measures, the total hit to the U.S. economy could reach $210 billion.KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP/Getty ImagesThe White House has justified the tariffs using the Section 232 of Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which authorizes the President to adjust the imports of products from other countries through tariffs if those imports may threaten national security.Toyota employs 137,000 people across its ten factories and dealerships in the U.S.â€œThey are not a national security threat,â€? a Toyota representative said in a statement, according to CNBC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By AFPTHE European Union has â€œa card to playâ€? if it offers a united front in its response to the trade war pitting the United States against China, International Monetary Fund director Christine Lagarde said Saturday.â€œIn the show of force we see coming to bearâ€¦ between the United States on the one hand and China on the other, who represent two totally different forms of capitalist impetus, Europe can play a very particular card,â€? Lagarde told an economic forum in the southern French city of Aix-en-Provence.â€œEurope is strategic for the one as for the other (the United States and China)â€? when it comes to trade, said Lagarde a week ahead of a bilateral EU-China summit which the latter will host July 16 and 17 in Beijing.She added Europe had the power to balance out the commercial powerplay between Washington and Beijing with neither enjoying sufficient leverage to swing it to either camp.â€œThe Europeans together are a force, a power. When they are united they have a true voiceâ€? which can count, said Lagarde, adding that the EU could be a â€œsource of inspiration for many other countries in the world.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Donâ€™t start a trade war over sales taxesPost-Wayfair, is the welfare of our state really in jeopardy?By Andru VolinskyIn calling for a special legislative session to address the U.S. Supreme Courtâ€™s Wayfair decision, the governor appears ready to pick a fight with every state that has legally adopted a sales tax.No state is seeking to force New Hampshire to adopt its own sales tax and, to be clear, it shouldnâ€™t. However, now that the Supreme Court has ruled, it is disingenuous to lead New Hampshire businesses to believe that our state can prevent other states from enforcing their tax laws.The proposed special session may actually be worse than just a waste of state taxpayer money. Businesses that rely on hastily enacted legislation may find themselves subjected to fines and interest for not timely remitting sales taxes.The court in Wayfair dispensed with the requirement of a physical presence to impose a tax. The decision was authored by Justice Kennedy and crossed ideological lines. Before the decision, a business had to have a physical presence in a state to be subject to its sales taxes. A physical presence is a storefront or warehouse located in the taxing state.The requirement for a physical presence created an advantage for online companies over brick-and-mortar stores because only the brick-and-mortar stores had to collect taxes. A state that imposes sales taxes can now tax sales conducted entirely online once the seller meets a threshold of sales to residents of the taxing state.The tax decision will have no effect on businesses that do not sell online. Nor will Wayfair affect small or occasional online sellers because their sales will fall below required thresholds.South Dakotaâ€™s threshold is 200 sales or $100,000 in goods or services that were sold online in the prior year to South Dakota residents. Most states will adopt similar approaches.No one will like the process and there will be confusion, but online companies will adapt. Our rooms and meals tax that is paid by restaurants is a form of sales tax. Businesses in New Hampshire have adapted to it.Sales tax software is already available to automate the payment of rooms and meals taxes and will become readily available for other sales taxes.The governorâ€™s public statements focus on how heâ€™ll use the attorney general to personally make it difficult for other states to collect their taxes. He claims the welfare of our state is in jeopardy. Really? It appears the governor hasnâ€™t learned anything about starting trade wars and how they often backfire. New Hampshire businesses are not clamoring for the governorâ€™s protectionism. Indeed, the state doesnâ€™t yet know how many businesses will be subject to other statesâ€™ sales taxes.New interstate trade barriers will invite litigation and wonâ€™t likely be effective. States will impose hefty licensing fees to circumvent our efforts to thwart collection and compliance. Online marketplaces such as Amazon and Etsy already require compliance as a condition of use.This much is true, businesses and consumers will adapt once the framework for collecting the taxes is clear. The state of New Hampshire could help by working with smaller businesses to get them up to speed and could make compliance software available for free. Introducing more uncertainty will not be helpful.Other than the politics, there is little point to an emergency legislative session. In my opinion, we need to make New Hampshire a more inviting place to open or expand a business. The call for an emergency session isnâ€™t the kind of thoughtful leadership that will accomplish that goal.Democrat Andru Volinsky of Concord is executive councilor for District Two.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Small Business Owner Fears U.S.-China Trade War Will Destroy Her CompanyEnlarge this image toggle caption John Ydstie/NPR John Ydstie/NPRUpdate: On June 15, Lucerne International CEO Mary Buchzeiger said she had been notified that the auto door hinges manufactured by her company had been removed from the Trump administration's list of goods that would be subject to a 25 percent tariff.The last time Mary Buchzeiger was in Washington, D.C., she was a 13-year-old on an eighth-grade trip.This week, as the head of a small company that supplies parts to automakers, she joined other business leaders in the nation's capital to talk about President Trump's proposed tariffs aimed at China.'I'm not a political person,' she says as sips coffee in a cafe a couple of blocks from the U.S. Capitol. But she says she fears the tariffs could destroy her company.During hearings before trade officials, leaders of U.S. companies, large and small, voiced both concern and support for the president's strategy. Buchzeiger pleaded her case, hoping to save her company.She owns and runs a business founded by her father, Lucerne International in Auburn Hills, Mich. It's a small-parts supplier. But it's a big supplier to Chrysler's Jeep brand.Lucerne International provides all the hinges for the Jeep Wrangler. 'They're all class A forgings,' she says proudly. 'Our company is actually one of the only ones in the world that can produce class A forgings,' which are parts visible on a vehicle's exterior.'It's polished jewelry on the outside of a vehicle,' she says, 'It can't have defects in it; nicks, scratches, dents, dings, anything like that. ... It's gotta look pretty.' Check out the door hinges on the next Jeep Wrangler you see. They came from Buchzeiger's company.Enlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesThose hinges and about 90 percent of the parts Lucerne International supplies to U.S. automakers would be hit by a 25 percent tax under Trump's tariffs. The tariffs are supposed to protect U.S. businesses, but Buchzeiger doesn't see it that way.'They're attacks on U.S. companies that are using Chinese goods,' she says.And that's the rub. Buchzeiger's company produces most of its parts in China. 'I would love to be able to manufacture these parts in the U.S.,' she says.She says she's tried several times to find American factories to fill her orders. But she hasn't found 'one company that can handle even half the volume of one part' Lucerne International produces.'There's no capacity left for manufacturing here,' she says. Currently, Buchzeiger is investigating the possibility of putting a plant in Flint, Mich., where she was born. But if the tariffs hit now, she fears she'll be out of business before that could even happen.A couple hours after the conversation over coffee, Buchzeiger sat down in a stuffy and crowded government hearing room to tell her story. She had five minutes to make the case for an exemption before a panel of trade officials.Enlarge this image toggle caption Lucerne International Lucerne InternationalShe read forcefully from a prepared statement: 'The tariffs proposed by President Trump would cripple my business and many like it in the Midwest,' Buchzeiger told the panel of trade bureaucrats. 'I'm fighting for the life of my company and for the livelihood of my employees. And I'm fighting to protect an intricate auto supply chain that creates hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs.'Buchzeiger answered some brief questions from the trade panel, and waited while other business people made their cases, for and against the tariffs.'I think it went well,' she said as she left the hearing. 'I got the message across and it was exactly what I expected. I'm hopeful that they heard our message.'Buchzeiger is a Republican. She says she hopes Trump will get the message that his tariffs could harm many businesses and workers in the upper Midwest â€” 'Trump country.'If or when those tariffs take effect remains unclear. So, for now, Buchzeiger can only wait and hope.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON â€” Chinaâ€™s top economic adviser arrived in Washington this week in an attempt to defuse rapidly escalating tensions with the United States as the prospect of a trade war between the worldâ€™s two largest economies looms.But Liu He, the American-educated technocrat who is now President Xi Jinpingâ€™s top economic adviser, may face an insurmountable task. The Trump administration appears less predisposed to engage with China than perhaps any other White House in decades â€” a dramatic turn given the United Statesâ€™ long campaign to persuade China to open its markets to American products and investment.President Trump and his top trade advisers share a widespread view that China cannot be trusted to negotiate in good faith and believe that past administrations spent fruitless years pushing the Chinese to make minor changes to their economy that arrived too late, and were too often reversed.News that Mr. Xi has moved to abolish term limits for himself and his vice president has only increased suspicion in recent weeks that China has no intention of shifting toward a more market-oriented economic model and plans to have a state-dominated economy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON â€” The Trump administration escalated its trade dispute with China on Tuesday, saying it would impose tariffs on roughly $200 billion worth of Chinese fish, petroleum, chemicals, handbags, textiles and other products if Beijing does not change its trade practices.The threat comes just days after President Trump imposed levies on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, including robotics, airplane parts and ball bearings. Mr. Trump has said he is prepared to tax as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese products.On Tuesday, his administration detailed the next list of products that would face Mr. Trumpâ€™s wrath unless Beijing folds to Washingtonâ€™s demands. The White House is pushing China to reduce its trade surplus with the United States, halt intellectual property theft and open its markets to American companies.Neither side appears eager to blink first. China has responded to Mr. Trumpâ€™s initial tariffs with its own equal amount of levies on American goods like pork, steel, cars and fiber optic cable and has said that it is prepared to continue retaliating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To inflict more pain on China, the Trump administration last week raised the ante in its trade war. It now promises that the next round of tariffs, on $200 billion in imports from China, will be 25 percent instead of the 10 percent announced earlier. President Trump exhorts his supporters that tariffs â€œmean jobs and great wealth.â€?If jobs and wealth are the metric for â€œwinning the trade war,â€? China, not America, will emerge the victor. China will win not because of one-party rule, although it certainly helps President Xi Jinping weather difficulties caused by trade tensions. Rather, China will win because it is playing this game more skillfully. The tariffs imposed by the United States will mostly be paid by American companies and consumers, while China is retaliating with moves that soften the blow for companies in China, including those that are foreign-owned.To â€œwinâ€? a trade war on these terms, the United States would have to impose tariffs that somehow hurt the Chinese economy so badly that its leaders improve their treatment of American intellectual property, a longtime demand by American trade negotiators. The health of Chinaâ€™s economy depends on exporting to the United States, so, the thinking goes, the Chinese government will capitulate to American demands.This strategy is certain to backfire.First, about 60 percent of Chinaâ€™s exports to the United States are produced at factories owned by non-Chinese companies. Many of them produce customized inputs for American manufacturers, such as computer routers, LED fixtures and boat motors. That means the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration that are directed at China actually affect many American (and European) companies that own factories in China.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"HONG KONG â€” China is signaling that it is worried about its economy.Troubled by slowing growth, persistent debt problems and President Trumpâ€™s trade war, the Chinese government has taken steps in recent months to shore up its economy. It has pared back a high-profile campaign to tackle debt. It has restarted big infrastructure projects, a traditional economic engine. It has even censored bad economic news.On Sunday, Beijing went one step further.The Peopleâ€™s Bank of China, the central bank, pulled a financial lever that will effectively pump $175 billion into the economy. The government is aiming to help small and midsize businesses in particular, which have had trouble obtaining loans and face other rising pressures.The move signals that Chinaâ€™s economy â€œis really not doing well,â€? Chen Shouhong, the founder of the investment information platform Gelonghui, wrote on WeChat, a popular Chinese social media service.The growing trade war with the United States has been the most visible threat. In September, the United States imposed tariffs on $200 billion in goods from China.

"163 SHARES 3.4k VIEWS Facebook TwitterOilseed and vegetable oil prices fell last month as soybeans came into the crosshairs of a steadily increasing U.S.-China trade conflict.Oilseed prices fell by eight percent to reach a 17-month low and vegetable oil prices suffered a fifth consecutive fall, decreasing by three percent, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO).â€œThe Chinese governmentâ€™s announcement of an additional 25 percent import tariff on U.S. soybeans [â€¦] has weighed heavily on the soybean market, with strong spillover effects on soymeal as well as on the oilseed complex as a whole,â€? last monthâ€™s FAO commodity report stated.â€œWith respect to vegetable oils, the drop in FAOâ€™s price index mainly reflects lower quotations for palm, soybean and sunflower oil.â€?China is the worldâ€™s largest importer of soybeans, accounting for 60 percent of global trade in the commodity. As a result of these counter tariffs, global markets were rattled and soybean futures have slumped to a level at which U.S. farmers will begin to lose money without federal subsidies.â€œThere is a close connection between soybeans and soy oil and therefore other [vegetable] oils that compete very closely with soybeans too,â€? Dan Sumner, the director of the UC Agricultural Issues Center at the University of California, Davis, told Olive Oil Times.He said that retaliatory tariffs imposed by China on U.S. soybeans will have a larger effect on oilseed prices in the short run, but depending on where else U.S. farmers sell their soybeans, may have longer lasting effects too.â€œChina is a huge importer of U.S. and Brazilian soy. The effect on the price of American soy is larger in the short run, but may be long-lasting as the U.S. finds new buyers,â€? Sumner said. â€œThe U.S. also has a big soybean crop coming this year.â€?As a result of all this extra soy and slumping prices, many U.S. farmers have decided they will not sell. Marcel Smits, the chief financial officer of the worldâ€™s largest agricultural trader â€“ Cargill, told the Financial Times that it now makes more sense for farmers to â€œoptimize their flowsâ€? relative to tariffs and prices.â€œSales of the remaining 2017 volume has significantly slowed as U.S. farmers hold back,â€? he said.Meanwhile, global olive oil prices have remained steady, overall, according to the most recent data from both the St Louis Federal Reserve and European Commission. According to the research of the UC Agricultural Issues Center, olive oil prices are not usually affected by vegetable oil or oilseed prices.â€œOur data and detailed statistical analysis has shown little linkage between the broader vegetable oil market and that of olive oil based on U.S. olive oil import price data,â€? Sumner said. â€œOlive oil prices are very high compared to soy oil or canola oil, for example. Our data show that the other oil prices tend to move together and olive oil follows its own path.â€?Olive oil consumption also appears to be unaffected by oilseed and vegetable oil price changes. Studies in the U.S. have found that even when the prices of these competitors decrease, olive oil demand does not change.â€œWe found that in the U.S., the quantity of olive oil consumed fell when olive oil prices rose and quantity of olive oil used rose when olive oil prices fell,â€? Sumner said. â€œBut, there was no response of olive oil consumption to the prices of other vegetable oil.â€?â€œThat is, there is the expected demand relationship between olive oil consumption and its own price and no relationship between the other oil prices and olive oil consumption,â€? he added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Amid the escalating trade war with the US, the Chinese state media on Friday, April 6, said US President Donald Trump's threat of undertaking more trade sanctions against China was 'ridiculous'. It said so after Trump sought an additional $100 billion of tariffs on Chinese products, worsening an already tense situation over the dispute more.Global Times, which is run by the ruling Communist Party of China's official People's Daily, said in an editorial that the latest intimidation showed the 'deep arrogance of some American elites in their attitudes towards China'.On Thursday, April 5, the US president who has focused all his energy in 2018 to penalise China in an 'unfair' trade relation asked his trade officials to consider additional tariffs on Chinese products worth $100 billion after already imposing steep tariffs on two occasions in March and April.China also returned the 'favour' by imposing sanctions on US exports, escalating a trade war which has started sending a message of global repercussion.The Chinese news publication said Trump went on with his decision caring little about whether the tariffs are actually executed or what could be their impact.The Trump administration has targeted China for it alleges the latter of stealing its intellectual property and forcing the transfer of technology from the American firms.'US is climbing tree to catch fish'Earlier on Friday, the People's Daily also described the USA's action against China was akin to 'climbing a tree to catch fish'. It said by engaging in a trade war to reduce its trade deficit with Beijing, Washington was 'compounding its mistakes'.Washington's attempts at reducing its trade deficit by engaging in a trade war were compounding its mistakes, it added.'History and reality have repeatedly proved that economic globalisation has provided a strong impetus for the development of international trade and economics,' the newspaper said. It also added that the United States was 'one of the biggest beneficiaries' of this arrangement.It also advised the US to increase its own exports instead of targeting Chinese imports.A number of American firms, however, have not agreed to Trump's trade belligerence, saying it would harm its own people's interests in many ways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Beijing, Sep 18: China on Tuesday (Sep 18) threatened to retaliate with 'synchronised counter measures' against President Donald Trump's third round of tariffs on USD 200 billion worth of Chinese imports, saying the US' move will add 'new uncertainties' for future talks between the world's top two economies.President Trump on Tuesday slapped 10 per cent tariffs on USD 200 billion worth of Chinese imports and the duties will rise to whopping 25 per cent at the end of the year, escalating the trade war with the world's second largest economy. He alleged that China had been unwilling to change its unfair trade practices and the new additional tariff structure would give fair and reciprocal treatment to American firms.China's Ministry of Commerce said it would be forced to take 'synchronised counter measures' against the new tariffs. In a statement, the ministry also said that the tariffs announced by Trump had 'added new uncertainties' to trade talks between the two sides.Trump also warned China against any retaliation, saying if Beijing retaliated this time, the US would impose further tariffs on another USD 267 billion worth of products virtually covering almost all Chinese exports to the US totalling about USD 522.9 billion.According to official figures, US goods and services trade with China totalled an estimated USD 710.4 billion in 2017 of which US exports were USD 187.5 billion and imports were USD 522.9 billion. Trump has been pressuring China to reduce the trade deficit with the US, totalling to USD 335.4 billion in 2017. Last month, both sides resumed trade talks but at a lower level. Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen held talks in Washington but without much results.Trump, who has been demanding that China should reduce trade deficit immediately by USD 100 billion, recently called for talks to resolve the issue. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang gave no inkling about how China's plans to retaliate Trump's new round of tariffs and said it brought more uncertainties to future round of talks. 'I want to say that China has to respond to uphold our legitimate rights and interests, the order of free trade,' Geng told reporters. 'This measure by US side added more uncertainties to the talks between the two sides,' he said.Asked how the two sides plan to end the trade war, Geng said 'We have been stressing that talks need to happen on the basis of equality and good faith so as to resolve the issues between the two sides. What the US has done shows no sincerity, no good faith at all,' he said. To another question on whether China viewed escalation of tariff war by the US as an attempt to contain Beijing's rise, Geng said, 'Regarding containment, I have never heard of that from any US official. We have been repeating that sound and steady development of China-US ties serves the fundamental interest of the two sides and what the international community wishes to see'.Geng said China would like to work with the US to achieve that, adding that 'however the protectionist and unilateral measures taken by US were not acceptable to us'. He also declined to go into specific measures on whether Beijing would contemplate non-trade measures like containing visas to US citizens. 'In the light of the latest round of tariffs, China has to counter act but what kind of counter measures would the Chinese side take will be released in time. You made assumption (about not granting visas), I have no comment on that,' Geng said.Hong Kong-based 'South China Morning Post' reported on Tuesday that China is likely to cancel its tentative plans to send President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser Liu He to Washington after Trump's new tariff announcement. According to the source, who declined to be identified , as the plans have not been made public, China is reviewing its earlier plans to send a delegation, headed by vice-premier Liu He to Washington next week, the report said.Also read:China says tit-for-tat tariffs will 'destroy' US-China tradeOne precondition for the talks was that the Americans would show sufficient goodwill but Trump's latest decision to escalate the trade war by slapping new tariffs on almost half of all Chinese exports may have scuppered the talks, it quoted the sources as saying. 'If the vice-premier does go to the US, we can reasonably suspect he has a reasonable offer, but at this point, I would think the likelihood is low,' the representative said. China had earlier retaliated twice by imposing additional tariffs on imported products from the US.PTI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How Will Trumpâ€™s Trade War Impact American Politics?If President Trump's trade war continues, it could have a serious impact on the political fortunes of President Trump and his party.Doug Mataconis Â· Â· 43 commentsWith the President threatening to up the ante in his ongoing trade war, market analysts and other experts are warning that the effects of that trade war could end up hurting the President and his party at the ballot box:President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade wars could become a major political drag for Republicans, with job losses and price increases piling up just as voters head to the polls in November. Trump jolted markets once again early Friday when he said heâ€™s prepared to impose penalties on some $500 billion in Chinese goods regardless of the consequences that might ensue, economic or political. â€œLook, Iâ€™m not doing this for politics,â€? the president said on CNBC. â€œIâ€™m doing this to do the right thing for our country.â€? But market analysts, industry experts and economists warn that the economic fallout of the presidentâ€™s tariffs â€” those that are already in effect and those heâ€™s threatening to impose â€” is only going to intensify over the coming months and could reach a peak around election time. â€œWeâ€™re already hearing complaints now from companies, so by the time we get to the midterms, youâ€™re going to be hearing governors, mayors, Congress complaining about jobs, about cost increases, about problems,â€? Carlos Gutierrez, the former Commerce secretary under President George W. Bush, told POLITICO. â€œThe question is: Will that be strong enough to offset the idea that we have to get tough on our trading partners, and that our jobs are being stolen overseas?â€? It takes months for most consumers to feel the impact of tariffs, but as the fall approaches, everything from groceries to appliances could start to cost more at major retailers across the country. Democrats could use these price increases as a political cudgel against Republicans in swing districts as they try to take back control of Congress. Trump has so far suffered little political blowback for his tariffs and trade threats, saying that he is simply following through on promises he made during the campaign to crack down on trading partners, even close allies, and put America first. Since March, he has imposed blanket tariffs on nearly all imports of steel and aluminum and placed penalties on $34 billion in goods from China, a total likely to increase to $50 billion next month and into the hundreds of billions later this year. In return, countries have retaliated with tit-for-tat duties on everything from U.S. agricultural goods to Kentucky bourbon and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, aiming to sway top Republican lawmakers by hurting constituents in their districts. But Trump and his party could soon begin to face consequences as companies in the coming months start reporting lower earnings, reassessing their supply chains and holding back on investment, all of which will begin to ripple throughout the economy and could lead to a slowdown or full-blown recession, experts say. If all of the tariffs that have been proposed take effect, they would bring down long-run U.S. GDP by 0.47 percent â€” about $118 billion â€” in the long term and cost more than 364,000 jobs, a new analysis from the Tax Foundation shows. The International Monetary Fund also warned this week that trade tensions could cut global output by some $400 billion by 2020, and that the U.S. is â€œespecially vulnerableâ€? to effects of an international slowdown. Price increases would vary by product, ranging anywhere from a few cents on a can of beer or soup to around $6,000 on a family car, if the administration moves forward with auto-specific tariffs it has threatened.The President, meanwhile, continued his anti-trade propaganda campaign on Twitter this morning:Countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to Washington to negotiate. This should have taken place many years ago but,as the saying goes, better late than never! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2018Tariffs are the greatest! Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with Tariffs. Itâ€™s as simple as that â€“ and everybodyâ€™s talking! Remember, we are the â€œpiggy bankâ€? thatâ€™s being robbed. All will be Great! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2018As Iâ€™ve noted before, weâ€™re already starting to see the negative impact from the early stages of the Trump Trade War across a wide variety of industries. The Presidentâ€™s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, for example, has led to increased prices for both products regardless of whether or not they come from foreign or domestic sources. This has had a negative impact on manufacturers that rely on those raw materials and on American steel and aluminum producers who have seen orders fall due to tariffs that were allegedly intended to â€œprotectâ€? them. Particularly hard hit in the early stages of the trade war has been the American agriculture industry, which predominates in states that Donald Trump won in 2016 and where Republicans have dominated for years. In no small part, this is due to the fact that retaliatory tariffs from nations like China have been specifically aimed at red states. Even in the early days of the trade war, the American pork industry was expressing concerns about the impact that retaliatory tariffs on business with nations such as China, which has become a huge market for American agriculture. In Iowa, it was reported that the trade war could cost soybean farmers more than $600 million this year alone, with larger losses coming if the trade war continues. Weâ€™ve also seen that the tariffs and the retaliation are beginning to have a negative impact on other American businesses and have even led iconically American brands like Harley-Davidson to move production overseas in response to retaliatory tariffs from the European Union. Just today, Harley announced that it was cutting its earnings forecasts due to the anticipated impact of the trade war on overseas sales.As Iâ€™ve said in the past, itâ€™s likely that the full economic impact of the Presidentâ€™s trade war wonâ€™t be felt immediately and may take time to show up in the economic statistics. Indeed, many analysts are expecting that the first estimate of Gross Domestic Product growth for the 2nd quarter of the year is likely to show strong growth, perhaps something north of 4%, which is a target weâ€™ve only hit a handful of times since the end of the Great Recession. Additionally, while jobs and wage growth have both been rather anemic they have been positive and it appears that it will remain so for the time being. Additionally, while Trumpâ€™s overall job approval remains negative, his job approval on the economy is quite positive. Taking all that into account, itâ€™s not at all clear that something as esoteric as the long-term impact of the Presidentâ€™s foolish and ill-advised trade policies are going to play well with voters or have much of an impact on the midterm elections. If the war continues, though, the impact will begin to spread through the economy and that could present significant political problems for the President and his party going forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Amna Nawaz:President Trump set into motion 25 percent tariffs on more than 800 Chinese imported goods, including aircraft engines, industrial machinery and parts for electronics, to name just a few.Now, China hit back with tariffs of its own on more than 500 U.S.-made goods, some of which target areas of the country that voted heavily for Mr. Trump. That includes exports like soybeans, pork and corn.Let's break down how both sides are positioning themselves, and where the impact of the tariffs will be felt first.David Honig is an attorney who teaches negotiations at Indiana University. And Yasheng Huang is a professor who studies the Chinese economy and global business at the MIT Sloan School of Management.Thank you both for being here.David Honig, I want to start with you.Talk to me about the negotiating style that we have seen so far with President Trump. You break them down into a couple of categories. One is called distributive bargaining. That's what we're seeing here.

"China vowed to fight â€œunilateral U.S. protectionism at any costâ€? on Friday after President Donald Trump ordered officials to examine posing an additional 100 billion dollars in tariffs on Chinese goods.â€œOn Sino-US trade, China has made its position very clear. We donâ€™t want a trade war, but we are not afraid of such a war,â€? a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce told state-run news agency Xinhua on Friday.The ministry also vowed to take â€œcomprehensive countermeasures,â€? according to Xinhua, although it did not add further details.The comments echo the fiery rhetoric in state and Communist Party-backed publications over the past week as the standoff with the U.S. escalates into a possible all-out trade war.In a statement on Thursday, Trump said he had ordered the move â€œin light of Chinaâ€™s unfair retaliationâ€? to U.S. tariffs of 25 per cent on 50 billion dollars worth of Chinese goods he announced earlier this week.â€œRather than remedy its misconduct, China has chosen to harm our farmers and manufacturers,â€? Trump said.â€œI have instructed the U.S. Trade Representative to consider whether 100 billion dollars of additional tariffswould be appropriate under section 301 and, if so, to identify the products upon which to impose such tariffs.â€?He also said he had ordered the secretary of agriculture â€œto implement a plan to protect our farmers andagricultural interests.â€?The retaliatory tariffs ordered by Beijing this week targeted 50 billion dollars worth of U.S. goods includingkey exports like soybeans, wheat, aircraft and chemical products designed to hit the rural regions whereTrump is particularly popular.They were announced after the Trump administration unveiled a list of 1,300 Chinese products to be targeted by tariffs including from the aerospace, information and communication technology, robotics, and machinery industries.Tensions have been rising between the worldâ€™s two largest economies since August, when the US president initiated an investigation into anti-competitive trade practices by China and alleged theft of US intellectual property.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Thursday Trump was â€œright to ask for additional appropriate action to obtain the elimination of the unfair acts, policies, and practices identified in USTRâ€™s report.â€?He also said the tariffs, like those previously announced, would undergo a review period before going into effect, leaving the door open for talks.READ: Trade war: President Trump threatens China with additional $100bn tariffsTrump also said the U.S. was â€œstill prepared to have discussions in further support of our commitment to achieving free, fair, and reciprocal trade and to protect the technology and intellectual property of American companies and American people.â€?The potential total of 150 billion dollars in tariffs on Chinese goods come on top of the Trump administrationâ€™s announcement in March that it was slapping duties of 25 per cent on steel imports and 10 per cent on aluminium products.Key allies including the European Union, Canada and Mexico were excluded from those tariffs, but not China.Trumpâ€™s tariffs have been criticized by U.S. businesses and members of his own Republican party alike.â€œThe announcement that the administration may issue 100 billion dollars in additional tariffs on Chinese products is irresponsible and destabilising,â€? Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, said.The National Retail Federation accused the White House of â€œplaying chicken with the economy.â€?â€œThis is what a trade war looks like, and what we have warned against from the start. We are on a dangerousdownward spiral and American families will be on the losing end,â€? its president Matthew Shay said.Republican Senator Ben Sasse said Trump was â€œthreatening to light American agriculture on fireâ€? and that â€œif heâ€™s even half-serious, this is nuts.â€?â€œLetâ€™s absolutely take on Chinese bad behaviour but with a plan that punishes them instead of us,â€? he said.â€œThis is the dumbest possible way to do this.â€?Share this: TweetMoreWhatsApp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Donald Trump is rightâ€”the United States is not in a trade war with China.At least, not yet. As the rhetoric has flown back and forth between Washington and Beijing, breathless news coverage has made it seem as though the war of tariffs has already begun. It has notâ€”hardly any new duties have been levied. At most, the world is in its July 1914 moment, with the clouds of trade war gathering but shots not yet fired. Weâ€™ll know soon enough whether that is indeed the correct historical analogy. For now, the war is just words, and it would be best for the planet if thatâ€™s as far as it goes, because the only way to win a trade war is not to fight it.Story Continued BelowFor many, the line between words and actions has dissolved into nothingness. Beginning with Trumpâ€™s early March Twitter bravado (â€œtrade wars are good, and easy to winâ€?), continuing with the announcement of tariffs first against steel and aluminum, and then against approximately $50 billion in imports from China, and then on Thursday with a possible further round on $100 billion more, financial markets have sold off sharply with each new salvo, keying off everything from tweets to detailed lists published by first the U.S. government and then by the Chinese government of exactly which products would be subject to what duties.Hereâ€™s a reality check: The announcement of levies against global steel and aluminum imports in early March led to the implementation of those levies on March 23, except that a full 50 percent of all U.S. steel imports (from Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Canada and others) were then exempted from those tariffs. China then announced retaliatory tariffs as high as 25 percent on $3 billion of U.S. goods. Here too, the reporting has often been fuzzy: 25 percent tariffs on $3 billion of goods amounts to $750 million. What has actually happened? The U.S. is levying perhaps an additional $5 billion of tariffs on global steel and aluminum, which China is responding with less than $1 billion of its own. As a proportion of the nearly $19 trillion U.S. economy, that amounts to less than 0.0003 percent. As a proportion of the combined U.S. and Chinese economies, the number is insignificant.Even the larger figures recently threatened, on $50 billion of Chinese goods including consumer items such as flat screen televisionsâ€”and Chinaâ€™s proposed retaliation on an equivalent dollar amount of U.S. exports including pork and soybeansâ€”represent perhaps $25 billion tax on a reciprocal trade relationship that last year amounted to nearly $700 billion. Letâ€™s say that goes even higher based on recent escalating rhetoric and threats. The numbers are still modest in the greater scheme. If this is July 1914, it is a July where the third cousin once-removed of the Archduke of Austria-Hungary was assassinated, three battalions of Austrian and Serbian troops were dispatched to the border and the rest of the continent enjoyed its summer holidays.The words just now are a shadow of the actions that most of us rightly fear, and it is vital that we all take a deep breath and make a concerted effort to distinguish threats, bluster and modest action from a global trade war that echoes the retrenchment of the 1930s. The infamous Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930 levied duties of close to 60 percent on nearly 20,000 products, leading U.S. trade with the world to plunge nearly 75 percent. That was a trade war. What we are seeing today might be the first signs of one, but we are a long way from real conflict.That makes it an opportune time not to go any further. It may be, of course, that the Trump White House has in this arena found an ideal outlet for its tendency to speak loudly and carry a small stick. Chinaâ€™s response to the threat of broad tariffs has been to immediately threaten its own measures, while agreeing that now is the time to revise many past practices. One of the main goals of these announced tariffs is to retaliate against China for years of forced intellectual property transfer and dubious requirements that companies setting up production lines or business in China must have a joint venture partner with a significant stake and then transfer IP to that partner.While China released its own list of possible tariffs, high-level government officials have also signaled their willingness to review its past mercantile trade practices.Thus, it might be that, as new economic adviser Larry Kudlow said several times this week, there will be no tariffs, and hence no trade war. If indeed that is how the next few months unfold (and by law it will be months before any of the nonsteel and aluminum tariffs are actually put in place), then the White House will have succeeded in using the threat of tariffs as an effective tool to force some changes in the U.S.-Chinese bilateral economic relationship. That undoubtedly will be treated as a victory.And yet, ending years of Chinese infringement of American intellectual property will not do much to ensure U.S. competitiveness or prosperity in the years to come. Nor will a somewhat more open Chinese market for American goods. China is becoming a domestic economic powerhouse, making much of what it needs for itself and spending tens of billions on artificial intelligence research, clean energy innovation and next-generation telecommunications, along with the trillions it intends to invest in global and domestic infrastructure. U.S. tariffs may annoy China, and they might dent the $700 billion in U.S.-China trade, but the endgame is not a glorious recreation of the 1950s with America a global powerhouse and the rest of the world struggling to catch up.Trade statistics are highly problematicâ€”we tend to fixate on the hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S deficits, when in fact a large percentage of that is U.S. companies assembling items nominally â€œmade in Chinaâ€? and then selling them in America. The iPhone is perhaps the best example. It is treated as a U.S. import from China at its announced import price of more than $200, but as many economists have shown, only a fraction of that goes to China. The rest is distributed among global suppliers and Apple itself, but arcane â€œcountry of origin rulesâ€? make it seem otherwise. That is true for almost all products other than commodities and agricultural goods. Our current trade numbers reflect supply chains of the 1950s but how goods are actually made in the 21st century.That is in part why Chinaâ€™s possible tariffs against U.S. commodities could hurt more than U.S. tariffs against Chinese goods: Our pork and soybeans are basically all-American, whereas a goodly portion of Chinese imports have parts from countries around the world sourced by American companies domiciled in the U.S.The final problem with the tariffs is that China is the fastest-growing export market for American goods and perhaps the largest potential market for U.S. services. Those services include Chinese tourism to the United States and Chinese students studying here, whose economic ripple effects are surely under-reported (a Chinese student paying rent shows up in no trade number, for instance). And those numbers donâ€™t include China investing tens of billions in the U.S. to buy companies with its surplus dollars, nor its trillion-dollar investment in U.S. bonds.All of those promising, fast-growing economic avenues are threatened not just by U.S. tariffs but by a plethora of White House policies that make the United States less welcoming to foreign capital and business. Those include more onerous restrictions on student visas and more limitations on foreign investment, such as the recently nixed $100 billion semiconductor deal, which would have seen Qualcomm acquired by a Singapore company with deep business in China. Yes, as the administration is fond of reminding, the United States remains a global market like no other, but with multiple economic centers emerging, the U.S. is not nearly as central as it was. Foreign countries and businesses have more options and more markets than ever, and the more friction the U.S. creates, the more attractive those options become.Starting a trade war with a series of pallid actions is, therefore, the ultimate mistake. It interferes with one of the fastest-growing import and export markets in the world for the United States without generating nearly enough actual revenue to make a difference except to the already vulnerable domestic American industries and consumers that are purportedly protected. It does little to halt Chinaâ€™s future trajectory as a domestic innovator with its own intellectual property that relies less on the United States than in the past, and punishes China for acts already committed that cannot be retroactively reversed.Trumpâ€™s hot rhetoric may prove successful in the very modest sense of preventing some of the past abuses. Given the changed nature of Chinaâ€™s economy, that wonâ€™t matter nearly as much going forward even if the abuses continue, but some adjustment on Chinaâ€™s part would at least restore some level of trust between the two countries. That would certainly be for the best. It would also be a small step for such a large threat, compared with the much greater harm that might result. If, on the other hand, we do plunge into an actual trade war, the U.S. is unlikely to emerge stronger and China is unlikely to weaken. The only way for Trump to win his trade war is if it is never fought.Zachary Karabell is head of global strategy at Envestnet and author of The Leading Indicators: A Short History of the Numbers That Rule Our World.

"Perdue warns trade war may affect farm billWith Catherine Boudreau, Liz Crampton and Maya ParthasarathyTechnical difficulties delayed the delivery of Morning Agriculture this morning. We apologize for the inconvenience.Story Continued BelowPERDUE WARNS TRADE WAR MAY AFFECT FARM BILL: Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue acknowledged on Wednesday that the U.S.-China tit-for-tat tariff standoff may force Capitol Hill lawmakers to factor in trade disruptions as they work on the next farm bill. As Perdueâ€™s third RV tour as secretary brought him to Ohio, China announced that dozens of farm products â€” including soybeans and beef â€” stand to face 25-percent tariffs if the U.S follows through with 25-percent duties of its own on hundreds of Chinese goods in the Trump administrationâ€™s effort to force Beijing to change its intellectual property practices. Perdue tried to offer some reassurance that President Donald Trump will not allow farmers â€œto be the casualties if this trade dispute escalates,â€? but he later added that Congress might have to use the farm bill to help producers.â€œWhile we look to the farm bill to have a safety net, it has to be taken in the context of current events, and that would be the trade disputes that are ongoing,â€? Perdue said, cautioning that he couldnâ€™t say with certainty how the brewing trade war with China would ultimately affect agricultural producers.â€œI hope they would continue to develop a program that would create a safety net, but there may have to be some extraordinary measures taken, based on what we see regarding the trade dispute,â€? he added.Sara Schonhardt joined Perdue during some of his stops in Ohio and filed a dispatch for Pro Agriculture. Read that here.Itâ€™s all about funding â€” and funding challenges: Perdue didnâ€™t elaborate on what type of measures lawmakers may need to consider adding to the next farm bill, but USDA has broad authority to utilize emergency funds to stabilize elements of the agricultural economy. However, Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said at a Finance Committee hearing last month that adding a â€œspecial paymentâ€? to the farm bill to account for trade-related woes would complicate the already challenging funding situation.Rundown of aggies on Chinaâ€™s new list: Many U.S. agricultural commodities made Chinaâ€™s list of 106 products that are slated to get hit with retaliatory tariffs, including soybeans, wheat, corn, beef, orange juice, sorghum, cotton and whiskey, Pro Agâ€™s Catherine Boudreau reports. The tariffs, which have yet to take effect, come in addition to Beijingâ€™s announcement Sunday that it was imposing duties on $3 billion in U.S. exports such as pork, fresh and dried fruit, and wine.HAPPY THURSDAY, APRIL 5!

Follow the whole team: @Morning_Ag.TRUMPâ€™S TRADE MOVES TESTING AGâ€™S PATIENCE: While the Trump administration has tried to downplay concerns about the potential for damage from the brewing trade war, farming communities are already feeling the effects â€” and Chinaâ€™s new round of tariffs is aimed squarely at the heartland. Futures prices for soybeans dipped between 4 and 5 percent early on Wednesday in response to Chinaâ€™s new tariff threat, as Beijing buys nearly 30 percent â€” or $14 billion worth â€” of U.S. soybean production, Pro Tradeâ€™s Adam Behsudi reports.John Kiefner, an Illinois farmer, told Adam that â€œmost farmers kind of have their hands tiedâ€? and are past the point of no return when it comes to planning for their 2018 crop. â€œAs well as trying to outsmart the weather and bugs and weeds, now you gotta outsmart our president and you gotta outsmart the markets based on what the president is doing,â€? said Kiefner, who grows soybeans about 50 miles southwest of Chicago.Whatâ€™s next? Beijing said it would not act until the U.S. puts its new tariffs into force. The Trump administration does not have a specific deadline for finalizing its plan to slap duties on Chinese imported goods, but hopes to move quickly after a public comment period ends in late May, a USTR official said on Wednesday.Lawmakers, industry call for diplomatic fix: A host of agricultural groups and farm-state lawmakers like Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) urged the Trump administration to work with China on an agreement to head off the trade war, stressing that American growers and producers cannot afford to be in the cross-hairs of tit-for-tat retaliation.â€œItâ€™s my hope that the Trump administration will reconsider these tariffs and pursue policies that enhance our competitiveness, rather than reduce our access to foreign markets,â€? Ernst said in a statement, noting that she spoke to Trump on Wednesday about the tariffs. â€œThe administration must pursue trade policies that make the U.S. a partner of choice for nations that may otherwise turn to less free and democratic nations for trade.â€?â€˜Short-term painsâ€™: Trump administration officials on Wednesday emphasized the need to stop Beijingâ€™s unfair trading practices and suggested that dialogue would cut off further retaliation.â€œWe may have a little bit of short-term pain, but weâ€™re certainly going to have long-term success,â€? White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters. â€œWeâ€™re focused on long-term economic principles and making sure that we have a strong and stable economy.â€?Trump said in a tweet that the U.S. already lost the trade war with China years ago, and then made a nowhere-to-go-but-up argument that cited Americaâ€™s trade deficit with its economic rival: â€œWhen youâ€™re already $500 Billion DOWN, you canâ€™t lose!â€?Is Trump overplaying his hand? While many countries agree with Trumpâ€™s argument that China needs to rein in its unfair trade practices, his heavy-handed tactics could leave him with few allies and end up handing China a victory, Pro Tradeâ€™s Doug Palmer reports. Thereâ€™s also the question of staying power. Trumpâ€™s political party faces a key test with voters in November, but his Chinese counterpart, Chinese President Xi Jinping, has amassed so much power that China recently changed its constitution to allow him to serve indefinitely.PRUITT UNDER PRESSURE AS ETHICS SCANDALS MOUNT: First it was frequent first-class travel on the taxpayers dime. Then it was renting a condo on Capitol Hill from the wife of an energy lobbyist for $50 a night. On Tuesday, embattled EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt tried â€” and failed â€” to limit television camera access to just Fox News during an appearance announcing the agencyâ€™s decision to scale back greenhouse gas emission standards for automobiles. Also that day, the Atlantic reported Pruitt increased the salaries of two top aides even after the White House declined to approve them.Pruitt went on the defensive late Tuesday and Wednesday, telling a columnist at the Washington Examiner that the blowback is part of a â€œtoxicâ€? Washington, D.C., atmosphere filled with critics who oppose his deregulatory agenda. In an interview with Fox News, Pruitt said he had only just learned about the raises for his staffers and was working to correct the situation. The EPA also has said that Pruittâ€™s first-class travel was necessary due to security threats against him.But the White House made it clear on Wednesday that Trump isnâ€™t OK with all the negative headlines surrounding Pruitt. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that they are reviewing the situation. Some lawmakers, including Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo (Fla.), have called on Pruitt to resign.Saving Pruitt: Interviews with friendly media outlets and accusations that a former agency staffer is peddling damaging leaks are part of a bid by Pruitt and his allies in the administration to save his job, POLITICOâ€™s Emily Holden, Alex Guillen and Andrew Restuccia report.RFS waivers frustrate corn growers: The U.S. agriculture industry welcomed Pruittâ€™s early moves at EPA to roll back the Obama administrationâ€™s Waters of the U.S. rule and reverse its proposal to ban the widely used pesticide chlorpyrifos. But the corn and ethanol sectors now find themselves battling Pruitt on the Renewable Fuel Standard, most recently after EPA granted one of the countryâ€™s largest refiners, Andeavor, a â€œhardship waiverâ€? that exempts it from complying with the law.An agency spokeswoman said on Wednesday that EPA spared 25 small oil refineries from having to comply with the federal biofuel mandate last year. The agency did not identify the companies that received waivers in 2017, but said the waivers are â€œonly considered for refineries that submit applications and that are below the blending threshold.â€? Pro Energyâ€™s Eric Wolff has more here.ROW CROPS:â€” Hog waste trial, Day 2: The jury in the federal court case that pits the rights of hog farmers in North Carolina against the property rights of neighbors heard testimony on Wednesday from an environmental epidemiologist who was outspoken about the negative health effects of industrialized hog farming. It also heard from an environmental engineer. Pro Agâ€™s Liz Crampton, who is attending the opening of the trial, has more here.â€” Carrageenan isnâ€™t going anywhere: USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service announced on Wednesday that it will continue to allow carrageenan to be used in organic production, despite the National Organic Standards Board's earlier recommendation that the thickening agent and stabilizer be prohibited. More from Pro Ag's Catherine Boudreau here.â€” Mexico confirms high-level NAFTA meetings: Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday â€” part of a series of high-level meetings this week to discuss the ongoing NAFTA renegotiation. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray also met with White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, as pressure builds for the NAFTA nations to reach an agreement on a renegotiated deal in the coming weeks, yours truly reports. Both officials will be in Washington for more meetings today, and the three NAFTA nationsâ€™ trade leaders are set to hold a ministerial-level meeting this week.â€” Bankruptcy judge lets refiners off the RFS hook: A Delaware Bankruptcy judge approved a consent decree between EPA and bankrupt refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions, allowing PES to get out of much of its obligation under the Renewable Fuel Standard for 2016, 2017, and 2018, Eric Wolff reports. Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy, which filed an objection with the court, criticized the decision, saying it â€œwill give the Carlyle Group a free pass for skirting the law, even after they neglected the refinery while pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars in cash payouts.â€?â€” NAFTA termination could cause visa woes: A new report argues that U.S. jobs and economic gains will be lost without access to visas covered by NAFTA, as the trade pact increased accessibility to visas for some nationals from the U.S., Canada and Mexico. NAFTA created whatâ€™s known as a TN visa, which has allowed scientists and veterinarians from Canada and Mexico to enter the U.S. to help the dairy and cattle industries. Pro Employment and Immigrationâ€™s Ted Hesson has more.â€” A calculator to help with farm purchases: The National Young Farmers Coalition this week launched an interactive calculator to help beginning farmers find affordable farm financing, a project backed by USDA funding. Users can input the cost of land theyâ€™re considering buying and learn what FSA loans theyâ€™re eligible for along with whether the property qualifies for a conservation easement. Check it out here.â€” Cattle Ponzi scheme: Missouri resident Cameron J. Hager has been indicted for allegedly defrauding 89 investors by persuading them to invest a combined $4.7 million into a fund to buy and sell cattle for a profit. The catch? Hager never planned to buy the animals, according to court documents. More from the Kansas City Business Journal here.â€” USDA and SBA sign MOU: Secretary Perdue and Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon, who joined Perdue in Ohio on his â€œBack to Our Rootsâ€? RV tour, signed a memo of understanding between the two organizations to promote businesses and the agricultural economy in rural America.â€” Some good news for soy growers: The trade news has been bad for soybean farmers, but they triumphed in a provision in the fiscal 2018 spending package that prevents the Pentagon from unilaterally banning ingredients from troop meals. Previously, some of the top banned foods from meals served to the military included soy products, Bloomberg Government reports.THAT'S ALL FOR MA! See you again soon!

"The winding road to the trade warWith help from Doug Palmer and Hans von der BurchardTHE WINDING ROAD TO THE TRADE WAR: Lawmakers, industry groups and corporations spent months and millions of dollars trying to sway President Donald Trump away from imposing tariffs on China and igniting a trade war between the worldâ€™s two largest economies. But for Trump and those closest to him, it was always going to end this way.Story Continued Belowâ€œI always believed he was deadly serious about China from the very beginning,â€? said Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and outside White House adviser, recalling his time with Trump during the campaign. â€œIâ€™m not at all surprised that weâ€™ve come to this point. I am a little surprised that China hasnâ€™t been more conciliatory. But I think Trump canâ€™t back down, he just canâ€™t. He has to stand toe to toe with China.â€?China taps Wall Street: Several American corporate and political leaders have been fielding calls from Chinese officials trying to figure out what is driving U.S. actions. Among those who have been tapped include Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, POLITICOâ€™s Ben White and Victoria Guida report.For the most part, the back-channel talks have been â€œmore just trying to help them sort through who the players are and how they interact with each other and how influential they are with the president,â€? one official said.Long game vs. endgame: Now that the trade war is off the ground, there appears to be no clear exit strategy or end in sight. The situation has left corporate America, the financial markets, the agricultural sector and international trade experts uncertain about the endgame.The presidentâ€™s closest allies, however, shrug off all of those concerns, saying Trump is just playing the long game.'He has preached a confrontation with China for 30 years. The one thing he has been the most consistent on for his entire career is the economic threat posed by China,â€? former Trump senior adviser Steve Bannon told POLITICO in an interview. â€œThis is a huge moment, a historical moment. Itâ€™s really Trump against all of Wall Street.â€?Read the full story here. Pro Tradeâ€™s Doug Palmer and yours truly also had a wrap-up on Friday looking at the latest salvos fired between the U.S. and China here.ITâ€™S MONDAY, JULY 9! Welcome back from your vacations for many (most?) of you and welcome to Morning Trade. Any trade tips or news out there as we kick off a full week? Let me know: mcassella@politico.com or @mmcassella.COMMISSION PREPARES MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR RETALIATION AGAINST CAR TARIFFS: The European Commission is beginning to flex its muscle to show that it's ready for an all-out trade war in case Trump charges ahead with a 20 percent tax on car imports.EU countries were briefed last week that the Commission is drafting a potential retaliation list targeting up to â‚¬18 billion in U.S. products, two diplomats told Morning Trade.The list, first reported by the FT, includes items such as ketchup, frozen fish, raisins and other agricultural products. That would increase the pain for American farmers already feeling the brunt of Chinese, Mexican and Canadian duties targeting U.S. farm goods.One diplomat noted that the Commission seemed 'rather pessimistic' about the likelihood of Trump backing down from his tariffs, despite strong warnings from the EU as well as American, European and Asian carmakers about the disastrous effects that such duties would have for the U.S. economy. The diplomat said that countries have been warned that tariffs could come as soon as late August or early September, adding that Europe's best hope is for U.S. Republican and Democratic lawmakers to intervene.FRANCE WARNS AGAINST U.S. ATTEMPTS TO DIVIDE EUROPE: Berlin is again flirting with the idea of offering Trump a TTIP-lite deal -- either one that slashes industrial tariffs or offers a plurilateral agreement on cars. Such is 'a solution that I could imagine,' German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday.But French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire strongly warned his German neighbors to not risk dividing the European Union over trade.'In this globalized world, European countries must form a bloc, because what our partners or adversaries want is to divide us,' Le Maire said at the 'Rencontres Economiques' conference in Aix-en-Provence on Sunday. 'What the United States want, that's to divide France and Germany,' he added, according to French media.Trade war hits EU shores: Le Maire said it was evident that the EU was already embroiled in a global trade war. 'The question is not whether there will be a trade war or not,' he said. 'The trade war has already started.'CHINAâ€™S LI HEADS TO BERLIN: Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior government envoys are in Berlin this morning to meet Merkel and her cabinet for bilateral talks on trade, energy and the future of transport, particularly on autonomous driving.Li, who will also deliver a keynote speech at the German-Chinese Forum for Economic and Technological Cooperation later this afternoon, is expected again to push Germany (and the EU) toward forming a joint alliance against Trump's protectionist policies.German companies such as BMW, which produce cars in the U.S. that are being exported to China, are already beginning to feel the chill of Trump's trade war.Merkel and her Economy Minister Peter Altmaier have their own demands of Beijing, such as a greater market access for foreign investors; better protection of intellectual property; and the end of market-distorting subsidies.LIGHTHIZER SLAMS CANADA AT THE WTO OVER PAPER CASE: U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer lashed out on Friday evening at Canada and the World Trade Organization over the supercalendered paper case, criticizing a ruling as an example of â€œjudicial activismâ€? at the global trading body. The WTO ruled largely in Canadaâ€™s favor earlier in the week, saying that U.S. countervailing duties on the product, which is the glossy paper usually used in magazines, ran afoul of international rules.â€œThe panel report represents the latest example of judicial activism at the WTO seeking to undermine those laws and make it harder for Members to address unfair trade,â€? Lighthizer said in a statement. â€œThe United States has long warned that the attack on our trade laws risks undermining the credibility of the WTO, and we again urge members to consider the harm resulting from such rulings.â€?Lighthizer also slammed Canada for refusing to drop the litigation even after the U.S. dropped its countervailing duties on July 5. He said such a move showed that Canada â€œappears to be more interested in attacking our anti-subsidy laws than in resolving this particular dispute.â€?â€œBy pursuing this litigation, Canada is helping non-market countries like China that are more likely to use the type of hidden subsidies at issue in this case,â€? he said. â€œThe end result of such policies will be a global trading system that encourages unfair subsidies and puts true market-oriented companies â€“ in both Canada and the United States â€“ at an unfair disadvantage.â€?U.S. ENVOY DOWNPLAYS TRADE TENSIONS AHEAD OF NATO MEETING: Trade tensions between the U.S. and longtime allies over Trumpâ€™s decision to impose tariffs on their steel and aluminum exports to protect U.S. national security have not bled over into military activities at NATO, the U.S. ambassador to the treaty organization said Sunday ahead of Trumpâ€™s trip to Europe.â€œOne thing I will say is that in all of the disagreements that we have seen at the G-7 and with allies with whom we are now having trade talks and negotiations and tariffs, that has not come up in the NATO context,â€? U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison told â€œFox News Sunday.â€? â€œOur diplomats are professional and they are staying on our NATO issues, where we are 100 percent allied.â€?But at a rally last week in Great Falls, Mont., Trump resurrected his twin complaints that European members of NATO donâ€™t pay their fair share of the groupâ€™s defense needs and that the European Union is â€œkillingâ€? the United States on trade because of higher tariffs and other barriers.â€œIâ€™m going to tell NATO â€˜Youâ€™ve got to start paying your bill. The United States is not going to take care of everythingâ€™,â€? he said. â€œThey kill us on trade. They kill us on other things. They make it impossible to do business in Europe. Yet they come in and they sell their Mercedes and their BMWs to us.â€?Trump will be in Brussels on Wednesday and Thursday for the NATO summit. He will be facing off with many of the leaders that he clashed with over trade at the recent G-7 summit in Canada, such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, British Prime Minister Theresa May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump will then travel to the U.K. for a two-day visit with May, Queen Elizabeth II and other British officials. He will spend the weekend in Scotland before traveling to Helsinki for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.The EUâ€™s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, will be in Washington on Wednesday, where his itinerary includes a stop at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to discuss â€œthe current negotiations between the UK and the EU and to outline the prospective economic impact of different scenarios,â€? according to the Chamber.ROSS SIGNS MOU WITH GHANA AHEAD OF AGOA FORUM: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross stopped by Ghana last week to sign a memorandum of understanding with Ghanian Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta to deepen the commercial partnership between the two nations, the Commerce Department said Friday.Ross joined Commerce Undersecretary for International Trade Gilbert Kaplan on the last leg of a four-nation trip that included stops in Ethiopia, Kenya and Ivory Coast. Ross and Kaplan were accompanied by members of the Presidentâ€™s Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa (PAC-DBIA). The Commerce Department said companies in the group had already signed more than $1 billion in private-sector deals and could sign $2 billion more.â€œItâ€™s clear U.S. companies want to grow their businesses in Africa, and these countries can facilitate that by improving their business climates, thereby enabling the growth of the digital economy, agriculture, health care, energy, manufacturing, and service sectors,â€? Ross said in statement. â€œWe are finding solutions to transition aid-based economies to trade-based economies by creating new pathways for mutually beneficial long-term partnerships.â€?The trip comes just ahead of the annual African Growth and Opportunity Act Forum, taking place on Wednesday and Thursday. Lighthizer is co-chairing this yearâ€™s meeting at the State Department with Kenyan Secretary for Ministry of Industry, Trade and Cooperatives Adan Mohamed, the State Department said Friday.Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Africa Constance Hamilton is scheduled to speak on Tuesday morning at the private sector AGOA forum hosted by the Corporate Council on Africa. Hamilton and other speakers are expected to discuss the administrationâ€™s interest in launching free trade talks with at least one African nation in the near future, according to a CCA advisory.TRADE REMEDY CORNER, DAY 532: We probably wouldnâ€™t have noticed, but turns out Friday was the 532nd day of the Trump administration. The Commerce Department said it ha initiated 119 new anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations over that period of time. â€œThis is 30 percent more than the 91 initiations in the last 532 days of the previous administration,â€? the Commerce Department said.However, the number of investigations that any administration initiates largely depends on the number of petitions it receives from industry groups. The Trump administration self-initiated a pair of anti-dumping and countervailing investigations into imports of common alloy aluminum sheet from China, but 117 of 119 investigations it has started so far were at the request of industry.As the Trump administration lengthens its period of comparison, the gap between itself and the Obama administration has begun to narrow. For example, a Jan. 2, 2018, press release noted the Trump administration had initiated 82 antidumping and countervailing duty investigations from Jan. 20 through Dec 31, 2017 â€“ â€œa 58 percent increase from 48 in the previous year.â€?Cast iron soil pipe fittings: The impetus for Fridayâ€™s comparison was the announcement of final anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of cast iron soil pipe fittings from China, which totaled about $7.8 million last year. Commerce set final anti-dumping duties of 22.11 to 360.39 percent and final CVD duties of 7.37 to 133.94 percent.INTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHTâ€” The U.S. threatened to use trade sanctions to force Ecuador to drop an international provision calling for all nations to encourage breastfeeding, The New York Times reports.â€” Chinaâ€™s vice president is so far sitting back and refraining from playing a prominent role in the trade war, Reuters reports.â€” Local agricultural industries from Florida to Washington state slam Trumpâ€™s trade war, Axios reports.THAT'S ALL FOR MORNING TRADE!

"If a trade war with China escalates, David Dollar, a Brookings Institution fellow and former U.S. Treasury envoy to Beijing, said the American farm sector could be hit hardest. | Getty Images POLITICO Money Podcast How a Trump trade war with China could whack the U.S.Subscribe to POLITICO Money on Apple Podcasts here. | Subscribe via Stitcher here.President Donald Trumpâ€™s plan to slap as much as $60 billion in tariffs on imported Chinese goods could eventually trigger a trade war that slams American farmers, according to a leading expert on the U.S.-China relationship.Story Continued BelowDavid Dollar, a Brookings Institution fellow and former U.S. Treasury envoy to Beijing, said in the latest POLITICO Money podcast that Trump misunderstands the nature of the U.S. trade relationship with China â€” and that a trade war could badly damage the American economy.â€œI think the argument that we are losing out to China â€” that they are cheating everywhere â€” I think thatâ€™s overblown,â€? he said. â€œThe administration focuses a lot on the imbalance in the relationship, and thatâ€™s not really a very useful metric. The trade balance is largely a macroeconomic variable. In the case of the U.S., we donâ€™t save enough, so as a result we run a trade deficit.â€?If a trade war with China escalates, Dollar said, the American farm sector could be hit hardest.â€œWhat you would find in a serious trade war is much reduced demand, including for U.S. agricultural products,â€? he said. â€œFarm prices would fall and maybe even collapse.

"President Donald Trumpâ€™s heavy-handed tactics could alienate global allies and end up handing China a victory in a trade war â€” even though many world leaders agree that Chinaâ€™s trade tactics should be reformed.After annoying key trading partners by demanding trade concessions from them, Trump could fail to gather a coalition to exert maximum pressure on Beijing. And without that, China could dodge making significant reforms that would change its long-term trade surplus.Story Continued BelowItâ€™s also possible that China could simply outlast the U.S. in a protracted standoff. Its entrenched authoritarian regime doesnâ€™t face the same political risks that Trump does. And Americans could be less willing to suffer higher prices and shortages of consumer goods than the Chinese.â€œI think right now that the Chinese are playing this a little more adroitly than the Trump administration,â€? said Scott Kennedy, a China analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. â€œThere's more global sympathy with their position, even though their industrial policy machine is a danger to everyone else.â€?Trump has raised doubts in the business community that he actually has a strategy that will produce meaningful changes in Chinese business practices, rather than simply inflict pain on both sides of the Pacific.If China appeases Trump by making large purchases to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, Trump could tout that as victory. But others would count it as a loss by allowing China to escape without making significant reforms. In addition, other countries who lost sales because of Beijingâ€™s new preference for American goods would be displeased.And while Trumpâ€™s impulse to stand up to China is popular with many in his base, he's in a less secure position politically than his Chinese counterpart, Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has amassed so much power that China recently changed its constitution to allow him to serve indefinitely, instead of requiring him to step down in five years at the end of his second term.Sign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news â€” weekday mornings, in your inbox.

That means the tariffs could directly affect farmers and workers who voted for Trump.â€œI think the Chinese view him as a paper tiger, but one that's still dangerous,â€? Kennedy said. Thatâ€™s because Trump is less beholden to traditional business interests than most politicians and therefore more likely to take big risks, he said.Meanwhile, Xi is widely expected to give a speech this weekend in southern China announcing significant market liberalization and potentially puncturing the premise for Trump's trade action.â€œThat will be an interesting move on their part to see if they can put forth enough goodies to attract the Trump administration's attention or at least sway opinion from investors, other countries who are trying to decide which of these two sides they want to support,â€? Kennedy said.â€œYou've got Japan, you've got South Korea, you got the Europeans, the Germans who will be judging what comes out of Xi Jinping's speech. So I think we're going to see efforts on both sides to up the ante and grab the moral high ground in the coming week,â€? he added.A big question, which U.S. business officials said is still very much in doubt, is whether China is actually willing to negotiate changes to its industrial policies that are the root cause of business complaints from around the world. The Chinese government said it was open to negotiations, but insisted that the U.S. fiscal policies and export controls are mostly to blame for the huge U.S. trade deficit with China, which totaled a record $375 billion last year.The Business Roundtable, which represents leading American companies, said Tuesday it agreed with the administrationâ€™s concerns â€œregarding Chinaâ€™s unfair trade practices, including theft of intellectual property, restrictions on foreign investment, and policies that foster unfair competition.â€?â€œBut unilaterally imposing $50 billion of new tariffs without a long-term strategy that leads to economic reforms in China will only hurt Americaâ€™s businesses, workers, and families,â€? BRT added. â€œInstead, the administration should work with U.S. allies on an approach that advances meaningful reform in China without imposing significant harm on Americaâ€™s economy.â€?Instead of making that case and gathering international support to go after China, Trump alienated key allies and trading partners in March by imposing new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in the name of national security. He later softened the blow by temporarily exempting the European Union, Canada, Mexico and four other trading partners. But those countries are still required to make some other concession to be permanently exempted, as South Korea recently did after it agreed to a quota on its steel exports to the U.S.â€œIt's ironic that just at the moment when much of the world agrees with the United States on the pressing need for Chinese reform, we're kind of wrong-footing ourselves by needlessly picking fights with our friends,â€? said Daniel Price, a former White House senior economic adviser who served under George W. Bush.To win over allies, the administration needs to enumerate its demands, set out a timetable for China to act, explain to Beijing the consequences of failing to reform and 'make sure your allies are in lockstep with you,â€? Price said. â€œThus far from all appearances, it seems that the administration has adopted a policy of shoot first, set strategy later.â€?A USTR official defended the administrationâ€™s approach, saying Trump threatened to impose tariffs on China during the 2016 campaign and gave Beijing a number of opportunities since taking office to make changes to address U.S. concerns.Under the schedule laid out Tuesday night by USTR, the Trump administration could impose the new U.S. tariffs as early as late May, although it did not set any deadline for making that move. China said it would wait until the U.S. acts before imposing its new duties.U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and other officials seemed to calm the markets by suggesting that talks would avert further trade retaliations.The fact that Xi and Trump have â€œa good personal relationshipâ€? bodes well for getting a deal, Ross added.â€œTheyâ€™re both very strong leaders. [But] That doesnâ€™t mean this is going to be Armageddon,â€? Ross said. â€œOne of the good things about people having a relationship with each other when there is a conflict coming up is that at least thereâ€™s a dialogue. At least thereâ€™s a mutual respect and those are usually the foundation for ultimately reaching a deal.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"European Union Commissioner for Jobs, Growth, Investment and Competitiveness Jyrki Katainen | Thierry Charlier/AFP via Getty Images EUâ€™s Katainen warns Trump against â€˜global trade warâ€™ on two fronts â€œI easily can see very unfortunate and worrisome developments ahead of us,â€? commissioner says.European Commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen warned today that U.S. President Donald Trump could trigger â€œa global trade warâ€? by blocking imports of steel and aluminum.If Trump goes ahead with measures expected as early as today, he added that Europe could end up fighting on â€œtwo frontsâ€?â€” both in the U.S. and in Asia.â€œI easily can see very unfortunate and worrisome developments ahead of us,â€? Katainen said at an event organized by the BusinessEurope lobby in Brussels. If Trump â€œis taking unilateral actions we have to respond, but itâ€™s not only a problem between Europe and the United States. Because it has an impact to steel production, steel market elsewhere, too.â€?As a consequence of sealing the American market off from foreign imports, â€œsteel is going from Asian countries [to] Europe,â€? because countries like China â€œcanâ€™t sell it to America,â€? the Finnish commissioner said. Such a situation would likely force Brussels to also erect safeguards to protect its own producers.â€œSo we can end up easily in a situation where we are in a trade war with the two fronts,â€? said Katainen. â€œAnd only because of one decision made by the president of the United States.â€?â€œLetâ€™s hope that some light will come to the White House, in that sense, so that we could avoid a global trade war,â€? he added. â€œThe problem is that I donâ€™t know how to stop the war if it starts. Itâ€™s easier to avoid the war than stop the war.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Franceâ€™s trade state secretary Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne | Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Images France tells Trump a trade war wonâ€™t go his way Trade secretary says US president will find American consumers turn against him in any escalation of hostilities.France has a message for Donald Trump: Americaâ€™s aggressive, go-it-alone tariff tactics are doomed.Speaking to POLITICO, French Trade Secretary Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne warned that the U.S. president risks igniting a trade war by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum, but insisted that his strategy would backfire.â€œWe are entering an era where trade war is starting to show its teeth. And we think thatâ€™s not good news,â€? Lemoyne said in an interview in a Brussels hotel. â€œAmerican politics today â€” unilaterally putting in place a regime of additional tariffs on steel and aluminum â€” comes on the heels of a policy which aims to gut the dispute settlement system of the World Trade Organization.â€?The U.S. president is using the threat of tariffs to pressure trading partners into new trade arrangements with Washington that he hopes will help slash Americaâ€™s yawning deficit. Mexico and Canada, for example, have only escaped duties on the condition that they strike a new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement that will tilt the balance of trade more in Americaâ€™s favor.When asked whether the EU would make any concessions, Lemoyne retorted that there was no way the EU, the worldâ€™s largest trade group, would be strong-armed into reviving a transatlantic trade agreement.â€œThis escalation in taxes and tariffs isnâ€™t good for the American consumerâ€? â€” French Trade Secretary Jean-Baptiste LemoyneIn part, he explained, it was impossible to resurrect the idea of a transatlantic trade deal because Trump had quit the Paris agreement on climate change. That has become a red line for new EU trade deals, at Franceâ€™s insistence.â€œWe have said that to strike trade agreements, this must be done with countries whose governments are party to the Paris agreement,â€? he said. â€œPotentially blocking us on steel and aluminum to force a free trade deal is not the right way.â€?Trouble on the home frontLemoyne also stressed that Trumpâ€™s tariffs would come back to bite the American economy. Beyond tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, the president is proposing a broader policy of reciprocity. That would mean lifting tariffs on, say, European cars because the EU imposes higher duties on motor vehicles than the U.S. does.While Lemoyne said Europe stood ready to retaliate directly against targeted U.S. products, he argued that Trump would be deterred from a broader trade war when an armsâ€™ race over tariffs ramped up prices for American consumers.â€œThis escalation in taxes and tariffs isnâ€™t good for the American consumer,â€? said Lemoyne.He added that recent U.S. tariffs on Canadian soft-wood lumber exports meant that American importers continued to import the Canadian wood but passed on the higher price to consumers. â€œIn reality this type of measure can turn against the Americans themselves,â€? he said.Lemoyne also insisted that Trump would fail in his attempt to disable the World Trade Organization as the global forum to resolve trade disputes. The U.S. is vetoing the appointment of new judges in the WTOâ€™s appellate court, in what the French minister and the European Commission say is an attempt to undermine the institution.Lemoyne warned that France would push for the appellate court to continue its work despite Trumpâ€™s opposition.â€œIt is necessary to think about all the forms of Plan B, which make it possible to maintain â€¦ a mechanism for those states that are in favor of having it. Because there is still a very strong majority of WTO countries that wish to continue to have this type of dispute settlement.â€œSo I think that now we must actually start to be creative and therefore France will also â€¦ put proposals on the table to restore efficiency to the WTO both in its function as a developer of standards and in its function as a judge.â€?French President Emmanuel Macron will discuss the trade tensions with Trump on his state visit to Washington next month, Lemoyne said.In another sign that Europe is unwilling to roll over in the face of Trumpâ€™s threats, Lemoyne said that Paris would use the EU leadersâ€™ summit on March 22-23 â€œto establish what we call a European chief enforcer, who would be charged with the power to activate all sorts of control mechanisms and retaliation measures.â€?Such an enforcer, who would work in the European Commissionâ€™s trade department, â€œcould also be a deterrent vis-Ã -vis certain partners who sometimes test the limits.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US President Donald Trump talks to China's President Xi Jinping | Thomas Peter/AFP via Getty Images Opinion Trump is losing the trade war with China Trump can either have tariffs to scratch his protectionist itch, or muster an alliance of truly free-trade partners to pressure Beijing. China knows which option it prefers.Thereâ€™s already a trade war, and itâ€™s being waged by Beijing.Chinaâ€™s ascension to the World Trade Organization nearly 20 years ago has failed in its large-scale strategic objectives. It hasnâ€™t created a liberalizing regime or a free-market economy in China; in fact, it hasnâ€™t even created a China ready and willing to abide by the norms of free trade.The regime of Xi Jinping, who increasingly looks like president for life, hasnâ€™t been pushed toward democratic reforms by a rising middle class. He has centralized power and written â€œXi Jinping thought,â€? challenging Western liberalism, into the constitution.China still champions state-led, rather than market-led, capitalism. It has no rule of law, and the government suffuses the economy such that the distinction between state-owned enterprises and purportedly private-sector firms is fuzzy. A country that has a â€œ13th Five-Year Plan for Science and Technologyâ€? is probably not robustly free market.As for trade, China has taken advantage of the WTO to push mercantilist policies. It uses non-tariff barriers and industrial policy the WTO wasnâ€™t built to address to maximize exports and minimize imports.President Donald Trumpâ€™s prospective tariffs on steel and aluminum have put renewed focus on China trade, although the tariffs, at least as announced by Trump, are a comically inept misfire if their true target is China. The rubric for the levies could be: â€œHow to lose a trade war with China in one easy step.â€?The tariffs donâ€™t really affect China, from which we import only about 3 percent of our steel. Meanwhile, they send the message that the U.S. government is lurching toward protectionism under risible pretenses (the idea that the tariffs are necessary to national security, when the largest importer of steel to the U.S. is Canada, is laughable). And they alienate allies.If the motivation is simply to protect select domestic firms from competition, whatever the knock-on consequences, the tariffs make sense. Otherwise, they run exactly counter to what would be a sound approach to Chinese mercantilism, as a compelling report by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation underscores.The report argues that there are two ways to wave the white flag on China trade â€” one, favored by the Washington establishment, is to accept Chinese cheating as the way of the world; the other, perhaps favored by Trump, is to adopt a mercantilism of our own. Both would concede to the Chinese an outsize role in forging new, less desirable rules of the road in the global trading system and poorly serve Americaâ€™s interests.A better approach begins with acknowledging that China is unique, and a unique problem. For all of Trumpâ€™s complaints, Mexico isnâ€™t pursuing a well-honed strategic agenda of exploiting the global trade system at the same time it undertakes an aggressive neo-imperialist foreign policy. Only China is doing that.China isnâ€™t the first developing country to adopt a policy of maximizing exports. What makes it different is its sheer ambition and its size, which gives it leverage over foreign companies seeking access to its market and international influence. As the ITIF report notes, China effectively pressures countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam to ape its unfair practices.Whatâ€™s the harm to the U.S.? Yes, technology accounts for a large share of job losses in manufacturing in recent decades. Yes, lower-end manufacturing would have left our shores regardless. But there is no doubt that Chinaâ€™s practices have harmed the U.S. manufacturing sector, and that Beijing works to block higher-value-added exports from the U.S. and is pursuing a comprehensive strategy to dominate in advanced industries.By no means should we emulate China. We should continue to pursue free trade, as a policy, not as a theology that prevents us from acknowledging that there is such a thing as unfair trade and that there are practical ways to respond to it.The ITIF report urges using a global free-trade regime against China. That means bringing more actions against China in the WTO and working to update the rules to capture Chinese cheating (and to begin thinking of a new organization if the WTO proves inadequate). It means joining, and influencing, a multilateral agreement like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It means forging bilateral agreements with up-to-date standards that reinforce principles that China undermines.â€œA failure,â€? the authors write, â€œto complete and to implement next-generation trade agreements that establish higher-standard rules, principles, and norms for market-based global trade will only cede the terms and structure of global trade to Chinese leadership.â€?We obviously canâ€™t do this alone. Weâ€™d have to lead an alliance of international partners to pressure China on specific practices, with tailored consequences if we get nowhere. There is obviously no chance of doing this if we are engaged in an absurd retaliatory cycle of tit-for-tat tariffs with the likes of Canada and the EU.Such a broad-based effort to crack Chinaâ€™s mercantilism wouldnâ€™t be protectionist, but the opposite. It would aim to foreclose Xiâ€™s ridiculous pose as the defender of globalization. â€œPursuing protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room,â€? Xi preaches to international audiences while systematically stealing foreign technology and plotting his 21st century autarky.Trump can have emotionally satisfying, blunderbuss tariffs to scratch his protectionist itch, or he can have a strategy to muster an alliance of truly free-trade partners to pressure China. He canâ€™t have both â€” and you can be sure China knows which option it prefers.Rich Lowry is editor of National Review and a contributing editor with POLITICO Magazine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The stock market, which plunged following President Donald Trumpâ€™s announcement of steel and aluminum tariffs on Thursday, continued its descent Friday morning | Eduardo MuÃ±oz Ã?lvarez/Getty Images White House shrugs off market decline following trade war tweet Economic adviser Gary Cohn was at work Friday with â€˜a smile,â€™ one person said, despite having apparently lost his drive to prevent Trump from adding tariffs.President Donald Trump formally declared a new era of American trade wars on Friday, spooking investors, exasperating top advisers and enraging U.S. allies.In an early morning tweet, Trump cast off decades of consensus that trade wars damage the U.S. economy and hurt more workers than they help, embracing a strategy that many scholars believe helped deepen and extend the Great Depression.â€œWhen a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,â€? Trump tweeted. â€œExample, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, donâ€™t trade anymore-we win big. Itâ€™s easy!â€?The stock market, which plunged following Trumpâ€™s announcement of steel and aluminum tariffs on Thursday, continued its descent Friday morning. The Dow dropped over 300 points shortly after the opening bell on Wall Street, adding to a 420-point decline on Thursday.Immediate market reaction offered a snapshot into the potential fall-out from increased protectionism.Trumpâ€™s trade war tweet came the morning after the president rebuked his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, siding with economic nationalists in his administration and announcing plans to impose steep 25 percent tariffs on imported steel and 10 percent in imported aluminum.The decision led Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president viewed as the main check on Trumpâ€™s protectionist impulses, to threaten to resign, according to two people familiar with the situation. And it had Treasury officials scrambling to reassure U.S. allies while monitoring the market fallout.One person close to Cohn said Friday that the NEC director was at work in Washington and had a â€œsmile on his face.â€?The formal declaration of tariffs and Trumpâ€™s robust embrace of trade wars spooked investors who fear who fear that while a few steel companies may benefit, consumers will face higher prices, trading partners will retaliate and manufacturers who rely on imported materials, including the auto industry, could suffer, perhaps severely.â€œThe idea that you can somehow win a trade battle by mutual impoverishment is just counter to economic consensus and decades of history,â€? said Scott Lincicome, a trade attorney and adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute. â€œGoing back 100 years and even dating to the Civil War, you look at the academic analysis of protectionism and the results are pretty much uniformly the same. You have far more costs than benefits and those costs are borne not just by consumers but by American companies and farmers and exporters.â€?Immediate market reaction offered a snapshot into the potential fall-out from increased protectionism.Shares in steel companies rose following Trumpâ€™s announcements but shares in companies that use imported steel and aluminum â€“ from automakers like Ford and GM to aerospace giants like Boeing â€“ fell sharply.American allies including the European Union and Canada immediately scorned Trumpâ€™s decision on steel and threatened retribution. Republicans on Capitol Hill also sharply rebuked the president.â€œKooky 18th century protectionism will jack up prices on American families â€“ and will prompt retaliation from other countries,â€? Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said in a statement on Friday. â€œIf the President goes through with this, it will kill American jobs â€“ thatâ€™s what every trade war ultimately does. So much losing.â€?The chaotic process that led to Trumpâ€™s tariff announcement also portrayed an increasingly isolated president â€“ besieged by scandal and losing some of his most trusted aides â€“ clinging to an issue he has pushed for years and that he believes helped him win the White House.But to advisers including Cohn and Mnuchin as well as Republicans across Capitol Hill and in corporate America, Trumpâ€™s decision to fully embrace protectionism threatens the two things actually going well in his presidency, a strengthening economy and rising stock market.Trump issued his latest trade war tweets even after the sharp market decline on Thursday.â€œHis braggadocio about his effect on the stock market has been undercut by events of his own doing,â€? David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisers wrote in a client note Friday morning. â€œHe is losing his staff. He is isolated and beleaguered. And in the midst of crisis he tosses an ill-thought-out bomb called protectionism that punches out the best of our allies and friends while it strengthens our nationâ€™s adversaries.â€?Cohn, Mnuchin and other free-trade advocates inside the White House argued for months that embracing tariffs and ripping up free-trade deals would threaten a stock market rally that Trump until recently loved to boast about.For a while, the argument worked, helping keep the president from unilaterally ending the North American Free Trade agreement and a separate pact with South Korea.But at least as of Friday, it appeared the argument no longer swayed the president. Trump issued his latest trade war tweets even after the sharp market decline on Thursday. And White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Friday morning said the president was not worried about the market declines.â€œThe presidentâ€™s still focused on long-term economic fundamentals,â€? she said. â€œHe is incredibly focused on the American worker.

(Reuters) â€“ North Dakotaâ€™s Heidi Heitkamp, one of the most endangered Democrats in the U.S. Senate, knows a political gift when she sees one.President Donald Trump carried her largely rural state by a landslide 36 percentage points in 2016, making her one of the Republicansâ€™ best targets in Novemberâ€™s midterm elections. But Trumpâ€™s escalating trade dispute with China would hit farmers hard, giving Heitkamp and other Democrats a rare political opportunity in a region where they have struggled for decades.â€œWe cannot survive a trade war,â€? Heitkamp said in a recent interview before an event with women business owners in Jamestown, a city of about 16,000 people in east-central North Dakota. â€œThis kind of disruption to a fragile farm economy is very disturbing.â€?Heitkamp, locked in a tight re-election fight with Republican challenger Kevin Cramer, has led Democratic attacks on Trump for ignoring the economic threat to the regionâ€™s export-dependent farmers. The trade dispute has set off political alarms across the conservative farm belt, putting Republican candidates on the defensive and complicating the partyâ€™s fight to retain control of Congress.Trumpâ€™s decision to impose tariffs on imported aluminum and steel along with other goods drew threats of retaliation from Beijing on a list of U.S. agricultural products, topped by soybeans. The crop is farm countryâ€™s most valuable export to China, worth $12 billion last year.The trans-Pacific quarrel strikes at the heart of Trumpâ€™s rural support in farm states, which host some of this yearâ€™s toughest Senate races in North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana, and competitive House races in Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Minnesota.About one-fifth of the more than 100 Republican-held House districts targeted by Democrats are in the top 10 U.S. soybean-producing states, making the prospect of a trade war a point of contention in rural areas where Democrats have had difficulty gaining traction.â€œTrump is asking farmers to endure an awful lot with this verbal trade escalation with China,â€? said Republican Craig Robinson, a former Republican party official in Iowa. If a trade war breaks out, he said, even farmers who backed Trump will vote for whichever party they think has their back.â€œIf thatâ€™s the Democratic Party, they wonâ€™t have to think too hard about it,â€? he said.Some farmers are already losing patience.Doyle Lentz, 56, who grows wheat, barley, canola and soybeans on his 7,000-acre North Dakota farm, said he was â€œangryâ€? about Trumpâ€™s combative trade stance towards China, one of the U.S. ag sectorâ€™s most important customers.â€œI just donâ€™t understand the approach of holding a gun to someoneâ€™s head to make a deal, that is not the way to do things,â€? said Lentz, a former chairman of the National Barley Growers Association and self-described independent voter.TRUMP SUPPORT STILL STRONGIt will still be difficult for Democrats to make inroads in many parts of the farm belt. While Trumpâ€™s popularity has declined somewhat in rural America over the past year, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, it is still higher there than in other areas.Many farmers who backed Trump say they are willing to give the president more time to negotiate a better trade deal with China, and with Canada and Mexico in the North American Free Trade Agreement.Many have presold at least part of the crop they will harvest this fall, cushioning potential tariff impact. Corn and soybean prices have stayed strong as global buyers stock up amid the mounting trade tensions; soybean futures soared to more than $10 a bushel last month, hitting a nearly 18-month high.â€œAs long as prices stay competitive, weâ€™ll be okay,â€? said Dana Kaldor, 42, who grows soybeans, corn and wheat on 1,100 acres in eastern North Dakota. Between forward selling and options, he is nearly 100 percent protected on his crop this year, he said.â€œItâ€™s when it starts hitting your pocketbook that it come become a problem,â€? he said.North Dakota Senate candidate Cramer, who was heavily recruited by Republican leaders to challenge Heitkamp, said his Democratic rival has been â€œhystericalâ€? in trying to stir up farmersâ€™ fears. Cramer said the presidentâ€™s tough talk is simply an opening bid in negotiations to win a better deal from China.â€œWe have to think about how we as a country will recalibrate our balance of trade,â€? he said.Still, Cramer acknowledged the possible damage to the party â€“ politically and economically â€“ if the tariffs are enacted and a trade war erupts just before Novemberâ€™s election.â€œIt could be a problem, Iâ€™m not ignorant of that,â€? Cramer said in a recent interview after a speech to the state party convention in Grand Forks.Other farm-state Republicans, too, are painfully aware of possible trouble ahead. In Kansasâ€™s 2nd Congressional District, Republican state Senator Steve Fitzgerald, who is seeking the open seat against likely Democratic opponent Paul Davis, said a full-blown trade war would shake constituentsâ€™ faith in Trump and hurt other Republicans.â€œHe is the leader of the band, whether we like it or not. So we will take a hit, no question,â€? Fitzgerald told Reuters.One of his Republican primary opponents, Kansas state Senator Caryn Tyson, said there was a sense of unease over Trumpâ€™s trade policies potentially hurting farmers who helped put him in office.â€œWe are walking on eggshells, waiting to see how this turns out,â€? she said.â€˜VOTE WITH YOUR CHECKBOOKâ€™Trump has acknowledged farmersâ€™ concerns over the mounting trade rhetoric, but has said they will ultimately be better off, even as China readies tariffs aimed at some of his staunchest supporters.â€œThey want to hit farmers because they think it hits me,â€? Trump said of China. He said farmers were â€œgood patriotsâ€? and promised to â€œmake it up to them, and in the end theyâ€™re going to be much stronger than they are now.â€?Democrats in competitive farm belt races, meanwhile, are keeping the heat on Republicans.Nebraska Democrat Brad Ashford, who is trying to regain the U.S. House seat he lost in 2016, recently urged voters to â€œexpress your opposition to Trumpâ€™s trade wars by voting against one of his biggest enablers.â€? Ashford was referring to his Republican opponent, Congressman Don Bacon.For his part, Bacon joined other Republicans from farm states at a recent meeting with Trump to urge him to find a trade solution that would not punish agriculture exports.Democratic strategists hope the talk of tariffs dampens Republican turnout in rural areas, and said it provide voters a real-world example of the kind of economic threat posed by Trumpâ€™s unpredictable and combative style.â€œItâ€™s another brick in the backpack,â€? for voters already weighed down by economic concerns and healthcare, said Tyler Law of the Democratic House campaign committee.Lentz, the irate North Dakota grain producer, said farmers have one loyalty come election time, one a businessman president should understand.â€œPeople are going to vote with their checkbook, thatâ€™s the reality,â€? Lentz said.(Reporting by John Whitesides; Additional reporting by P.J.

(Photo: Cheryl Evans/The Republic)The Trump administration's escalating trade war with China and other nations threatens job losses, higher prices and loss of export markets for many American businesses.But food banks and the mostly lower-income people who rely on them could be unlikely beneficiaries, with more food and greater selection. Meat, dairy products, fruits and vegetables are among the highlighted items.When the White House announced it would offer support to farmers facing lower sales abroad â€“ in retaliation for higher U.S. tariffs slapped on foreign imports â€“ it meant the U.S. Department of Agriculture would start purchasing food products for distribution to social-services groups, such as food banks and child-nutrition programs.Among these is a plan to buy roughly $1.2 billion in agricultural commodities the administration claims are 'unfairly targeted' by foreign nations, especially China.That could mean more food and possibly greater selection for people like Mary Buchanan, who has taken advantage of food distribution at United Food Bank in Mesa, Arizona, in recent weeks while her husband pursues a disability claim.'It helps make ends meet, and it's a blessing,' said Buchanan, 57, a certified caregiver. 'It frees up money to pay other bills.'The government's tariff-remediation program to help farmers, along with a bonus food program that the USDA administers each year to buy surplus harvest commodities, could mean an extra 4 million pounds of food for United Food Bank starting in October. That's an increase of about 20 percent for the nonprofit.Other food banks around the nation also will receive increased shipments.Jovaughn McCoy, of Gilbert, looks for bread at United Food Bank in Mesa on September 28, 2018. (Photo: Cheryl Evans/The Republic)Ironically, the extra largess could exert a strain on food banks, many of which are seeking higher monetary donations and additional volunteers as they struggle to distribute increased volumes of meat, dairy products, produce, bread and much more.United Food Bank is seeking to raise an extra $350,000 in coming months to get the increased food out, primarily to partner agencies.'We need to move (donated food) within 12 days of receipt,' said Dave Richins, United Food Bank's president and CEO.United Food Bank volunteer Barbara Ontiveros, assists clients with food distribution in Mesa, Arizona, on Sept. 28, 2018.

The Chandler resident said she enjoys the social interaction and sense of purpose.'It's an opportunity to meet nice people, and some of them like having someone to talk to,' she said. 'The people appreciate what we do â€“ they really do.'Raelyn Dawley, 2, receives food with her father Brandon at United Food Bank in Mesa, Arizona, on Sept. 28, 2018. (Photo: Cheryl Evans/The Republic)Expanded federal subsidiesThe government is pursuing several programs to boost U.S. agricultural exports and assist farmers facing foreign retaliation.Of the $1.2 billion or so of purchases to be spread over the 12 months starting Oct. 1, pork is expected to account for nearly half, $559 million, followed by apples, oranges/orange juice, dairy products and pistachios â€“ each at more than $80 million. The government also plans to buy other items, from beef to blueberries, peanut butter to macadamia nuts.Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the programs will allow Trump to strike long-term trade deals while easing short-term pressure on farmers.'Farmers will tell you that they would always prefer to sell a good crop at a fair price, rather than receive government aid, and thatâ€™s what long-term trade deals will accomplish,' he said in July. 'But in the meantime, President Trump has promised that he will not allow American agriculture to bear the brunt of the unjustified retaliation from foreign nations.'Reach the reporter at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com.Read or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2018/10/03/president-trump-tariffs-food-banks-across-country-set-benefit-trade-war/1510747002/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Photo: Zach Boyden-Holmes/The Register)An escalating trade war between the U.S. and China will hit two key parts of Iowa's economy â€” farming and manufacturing.And the timing is terrible.China said Monday it will levy tariffs of up to 25 percent on pork, ethanol and dozens of other products that would hammer Iowa's ag economy as it struggles to get out of a lingering downturn.'It's going to make a bad situation worse for agriculture,' said David Swenson, an Iowa State University economist.And President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum would hit Iowa manufacturing as it's getting back on its feet.Manufacturers in February employed close to 224,000 Iowans, the largest number of workers since the 2008 recession.The hit to manufacturing will be compounded since much of Iowa production is tied to agriculture.More: The U.S.-China trade war could send your bacon and ham costs on a roller coasterSukup Manufacturing workers wire the nerve center for one of the company's grain bins on Thursday, Dec. 14, 2017, in Sheffield, Iowa.

MORE: Trump's call for tariffs creating anxiety in the farm belt'This will reach across Iowa, because it's impacting both manufacturing and ag sectors,' Hart said. 'That will hit the state economy. That will hit the state government.'Gov. Kim Reynolds last month approved $35.5 million in budget cuts needed to balance the budget.'We'll feel it, whether we're in Des Moines or rural Iowa,' Hart said.'We are the world's grocery store'Manufacturing was the second-largest driver of Iowa's economy in 2016 after financial services. And it's the fourth-largest employer.Iowa is a leading national producer of corn, soybeans, pigs, cattle and eggs.Agriculture 'has been buffeted with low prices and low income for four or five years,' Hart said. 'A tariff hit now exacerbates a problem that the industry has already been wrestling with.'Ag leaders hoped to improve commodity prices by expanding trade.'We are the world's grocery store,' Hart said. 'We produce more corn, more soybeans, more pork, more beef than we can consume. We rely on selling it to the rest of the world.'Low commodity prices already have triggered dramatic consolidation within the agribusiness industry, resulting in thousands of jobs lost nationally.Big mergers include Dow-DuPont, ChemChina-Syngenta and Bayer-Monsanto.Swenson said the pork tariff could hurt jobs at Iowa's pork processing plants in towns such as Storm Lake, Sioux City, Council Bluffs and Perry.Steel prices are already climbing for manufacturers.Sukup Manufacturing, whose 600 employees make grain bins and dryers in rural Iowa, said last month that steel prices had climbed 25 percent.Though the company sources its steel from U.S. mills in places like Indiana and Pennsylvania, CFO Steve Sukup expected demand for American-made steel to drive prices up if steel imports face a new tariff.Steel bars sit ready to be welded at Sukup Manufacturing in Sheffield, Iowa, on Thursday, Dec. 14, 201.

Look to control or reduce costs,' often through layoffs, he said.'It's not a tipping point'Overall, the state's economy should be able to withstand the blow, with financial and business services, construction and other industries growing, Swenson said.He expects Iowa's already slow-growing economy will grow a little slower. 'It's not a tipping point,' he said.The looming trade war already had Iowa farmers worried.?REGISTER EDITORIAL: Is it too late for Iowa Republicans to undo Trump's mistakes on trade?An economist said last week that pork producers in Iowa had already lost about $240 million due to price declines as China threatened to retaliate against U.S. with tariffs.Mexico, Hong Kong and China, Japan and Canada are the nation's top export markets for U.S. pork.The Chinese market alone purchased about $1.1 billion in U.S. pork last year, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation.Trump said last month he planned to impose tariffs on $60 billion worth of Chinese technology and telecommunication products.He had previously proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum.MORE VIEWS FROM AROUND IOWA:Ethanol on China's tariff listEthanol producers, too, are on the Chinese tariff hit list.The country will increase an existing 30 percent tariff on the fuel by an additional 15 percent.Iowa leads the nation in ethanol production, shipping out a record 4.2 billion gallons of the renewable fuel last year.About half of Iowa's corn production is used to make ethanol and dry distillers grain, a feed for livestock.Hart said he's concerned about trade tariffs escalating into other products, especially soybeans, a leading Iowa crop.China, with a population of more than 1.4 billion, imports about 60 percent of global soybean production.About 40 percent of Chinaâ€™s soybean imports come from the U.S. and are valued at $14 billion, the Iowa Soybean Association said.â€” Des Moines Register reporter Kevin Hardy contributed to this story.CLOSE According to a report by Reuters, China has urged the United States to 'pull back from the brink' as President Donald Trump's proposed plan for new tariffs on up to 60 billion-dollars in Chinese goods appears to have moved the world's two largest economies closer to a trade war.

"President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade war with China over steel and aluminum imports has had reverberations across the country, from Iowa soybean farms to Harley-Davidson motorcycles made in Wisconsin.The international trade spat is now threatening vintners across the North Coast who are attempting to make inroads into China, the worldâ€™s biggest market with 1.4 billion residents. Beijing is threatening a 25 percent tariff on U.S. wine imports next month on top of a 15 percent tariff it already imposed in April in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on its steel products.â€œThe category of California wine is trendy and popular there, and it is really resonating with the younger consumer,â€? said Linsey Gallagher, director of international marketing at the Wine Institute, the main trade group that represents California wineries.â€œItâ€™s so frustrating because, in theory, this high-level trade dispute doesnâ€™t have anything to do with wine,â€? Gallagher added.Even with the April tariff, U.S. wine exports rose 14 percent, to $38.4 million, in the first half of 2018, according to the Wine Institute. But vintners fear any additional levies will make U.S. wine too expensive for Chinese distributors to stock, compared to wine from other countries. If the new levies take effect, overall taxes and tariffs for U.S. wine into China will be almost 100 percent, Gallagher noted.Napa Valleyâ€™s Girard Winery is a perfect example of the dangers that local vintners face in the trade dispute. Its 2014 vintage cabernet sauvignon was served at a dinner last year hosted by Trump for Chinese President Xi Jinping.In the aftermath, sales of Girard climbed in China, said Pat Roney, chief executive officer of Vintage Wine Estates, the Santa Rosa company that owns the label.Girard has still been able to compete with the 15 percent tariff from April, Roney said. But another 25 percent? â€œIt would kill it,â€? he said.China is the fifth-largest market for U.S. wineries, which shipped $77 million in wine to China last year. While that amount is far behind the European Unionâ€™s $553 million and Canadaâ€™s $444 million in purchases, wineries and other U.S. companies are drawn by the potential of the Chinese market.

"Indications are growing that Chinese companies are scrapping plans to purchase oil from the United States and are instead turning to Iran for imports in what appears to be a result of escalating trade tariff war between Beijing and Washington.Sinopec, Asiaâ€™s top refiner, was quoted by media as announcing that it planned to limit purchases of oil from the US and that it would instead increase imports from Iran.Sinopec would continue to buy Iranian oil on fears that China would impose tariffs on US oil imports, Asia Times quoted an unnamed company executive as saying.The report further added that many other Chinese companies were also planning to limit their oil imports from the US in favor of bigger purchases from Iran.China, the worldâ€™s top crude oil buyer and Iranâ€™s biggest client, imported around 655,000 barrels a day on average from the Islamic Republic in the first quarter of this year, according to official Chinese customs data. The figure was equivalent to more than a quarter of Iranâ€™s total exports over the period, media earlier reported.Sinopec and state-oil trader Zhuhai Zhenrong Corp already account for close to 90 percent of Chinaâ€™s total Iranian oil purchases collectively. State oil group CNPC buys the rest, according to a recent report by Reuters.Last week, Chinaâ€™s biggest refiner ShanDong Dongming Petrochemical Group also announced that it had halted crude oil purchases from the US and instead turned to Iran for imports.The announcement â€“ as reported by Russia Today â€“ came amid escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington over trade tariffs.RT added in its report that the companyâ€™s decision came as Chinese authorities were planning to impose tariffs on US crude imports and replace them with oil from West Africa and the Middle East, including Iran.It also highlighted an announcement by Beijing that it was not going to fall into line with US sanctions banning business with the Islamic republic.China is Americaâ€™s second-biggest crude-oil customer with exports reportedly totaling 400,000 barrels a day at the beginning of July. However, in response to the latest US tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing slapped American crude imports with a 25-percent levy, RT further wrote.US tariffs of 25 percent on $34 billion of Chinese imports took effect on July 6. The Chinese government retaliated with duties on the same value of US imports, ranging from soybeans to cars, and has vowed to respond proportionately to any new US tariffs.Shortly after that, President Donald Trump said the US could impose tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, while his administration has prepared a new $200 billion list of Chinese products that could be levied with 10-percent tariffs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pushed back against warnings that the trade war between Washington and Beijing will jeopardize the global economy, saying that pushing China to open up will be good for all.Mnuchin told reporters in Bali, Indonesia, on Saturday that US President Donald Trump's drive to punish China with tariffs to encourage it to adopt fairer trade practices would not imperil the world economy.'Our objective with China is very clear: it's to have a more balanced trading relationship,' Mnuchin said.'I think that if we are successful, this is very good for US companies, US workers, Europeans, Japan, all of our other allies, and good for China.'The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned this week at annual meetings in Bali that the escalating US-China trade confrontation would hobble global economic growth, as the fund lowered its forecasts for this year and next.On Tuesday, the IMF cut its outlook for global GDP growth by 0.2 percentage points to 3.7 percent for 2018 and 2019, saying that 'everyone is going to suffer' from a clash between the world's two biggest economies.Mnuchin said, however that the IMF's warnings were 'all the more reason for China to be incented to address these issues with us.''Our objective is to increase exports and have a more balanced, fair relationship where our companies can do business there on terms that are similar to how they can do business (in the US),' Mnuchin said.Tensions have soared in recent months with the administration of President Donald Trump rolling out billions of dollars in tariffs against China in a bid to tackle its trade deficit and rein in what Washington views as unacceptable trade practices by the worldâ€™s second largest economy.On Wednesday, the Treasury Department announced new rules targeting China that tighten national security reviews of foreign investment.Analyst believe it is unlikely that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will reach a trade agreement during the G-20 summit next month in Argentina.'I don't think any decision has been made in regards to a meeting,' Mnuchin said. 'To the extent that we can make progress toward a meeting, I would encourage that and that's something we are having discussions about.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chinese Premier Li Keqiang says he is hoping Beijing and the United States can avoid a trade war.Fears of a global trade war mounted after President Donald Trump's imposed import tariffs on steel and aluminum earlier this month and, according to sources in Washington, the United States is set to unveil new tariffs specifically targeting China by the end of this week.Li, speaking at the close of the annual parliament session, said that China would open its economy further, so that foreign and Chinese firms can compete on an equal footing.'I hope both China and the US will act rationally, and not be led by emotions, and avoid a trade war,' Li told reporters in a televised news conference at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.Those hopes would be damaged if, as sources say, Washington goes ahead with plans for new tariffs on up to $60 billion worth of Chinese technology and consumer goods annually, in a move to fulfill Trump's campaign promises to get tough on China and its trade practices.Earlier on Tuesday, riding high after China's largely rubber-stamp parliament unanimously re-elected him and set the stage for him to rule indefinitely, President Xi Jinping warned self-ruled Taiwan it would face the 'punishment of history' for any attempt at separatism.The warning came just days after Trump angered Beijing by signing into law legislation encouraging closer ties between Taiwan and the United States.But for the world, the potential fall out from any trade conflict between its two biggest economies posed the more pressing danger.Without going into detail, Li told his once a year press conference that China will improve access to its services and manufacturing sectors while further lowering import tariffs, including those on cancer-related drugs.'China's economy has been so integrated with the world's, that closing China's door would mean blocking our way for development,' Li said.'China's aim is to ensure that both domestic and foreign firms, and companies under all kinds of ownership structure, will be able to compete on fair terms in China's large market.'Taiwan warningDuring his half-hour closing speech, President Xi was heavy on aspirational themes and he delivered a strong message on Taiwan, which is claimed by China as part of its territory.'Any actions and tricks to split China are doomed to failure and will meet with the people's condemnation and the punishment of history,' he said, to loud applause from the almost 3,000 parliamentary delegates.China has been infuriated by Trump's signing legislation that encourages the United States to send senior officials to Taiwan to meet Taiwanese counterparts and vice versa.Xi made repeated references to a resurgent nation of 1.3 billion people which would 'ride the mighty east wind of the new era' and was on the cusp of matching the country's greatest achievements in its long history.At the same time he reiterated increasing global concerns over China's rise were unjustified and added: 'Only those who are in the habit of threatening others will see everyone else as a threat.''We will not impose our will on anyone.'Trade tensionsWhen Xi's top economic adviser Liu He visited Washington recently, the Trump administration pressed him to find ways to reduce China's $375 billion trade surplus with the United States.'We are unwilling to see a big trade deficit, not only with the US,' Li said. 'We hope trade will be balanced.'In his remarks, Li said that as China widens access to its markets, there will be no forced transfers of technology, and China will better protect intellectual property rights.Trump says Beijing has forced US companies to transfer their intellectual property to China as a cost of doing business there, though China has insisted that technology transfers are not a condition of gaining market access.A source who had direct knowledge of the Trump administration's thinking told Reuters last week that the tariffs expected to be announced this week would chiefly target information technology, consumer electronics and telecoms and other products benefiting from US intellectual property.But they could be much broader and hit consumer products such as clothing and footwear, with a list eventually running to 100 products, this source said.'We hope the US could ease restrictions on high-tech or high value-added product exports,' Li said.'We will strictly protect intellectual property. We hope this important means for balancing China-US trade will not be missed, otherwise we will lose a chance to make money.'Economic targetsBefore the press conference, Li introduced China's four new vice premiers, including Liu He, widely regarded as China's new economic tsar. But adhering to protocol, it was the premier who did all the talking.Li said China was confident of achieving its 2018 economic targets. The government aims to expand its economy by around 6.5 percent this year, having easily surpassed the same target in 2017.China's financial sector was in good shape and banks have enough provisions, Li said, adding that regulators would take 'resolute measures' to tackle financial risks.The Chinese central bank was being given responsibility for drafting important laws covering the banking and insurance sector, with regulation over the $42 trillion sector becoming more streamlined and tighter.And Li said he was willing to consider a formal visit to Japan, amid signs of improving ties between the two nations.Tokyo has repeatedly pressed Beijing to do more to help rein in North Korea's missile and nuclear programs. China says it is committed to enforcing UN sanctions but that all parties need to do more to reduce tensions and restart talks.By Kevin Yao and Philip Wen/ReutersAdditional reporting by Lusha Zhang, Elias Glenn, Stella Qiu, Christian Shepherd and Ben Blanchard; Writing by Ryan Woo and Tony Munroe; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since her husband was murdered in Rwanda's 1994 genocide, Devotha Mukankusi has relied heavily on the UTEXRWA garment factory in the capital Kigali.'I survived the genocide together with my kids. But it's thanks to this job that they have grown up,' she said, her voiced raised above the drone of sewing machines as she supervised a group of women assembling police uniforms.Some 800,000 people â€” 10 percent of Rwanda's population â€” were killed in the genocide. The economy was crushed.Rwanda has bounced back in the past decade or so. As part of a drive to become a middle-income country by 2020, it is nurturing a garment sector it hopes can create 25,000 jobs. It's a strategy that has flourished elsewhere in Africa.But domestic demand for locally produced clothes has been stifled, east African governments say, by the ubiquity of cheap, second-hand garments imported from Europe and the United States.The manager of the factory where Mukankusi works says the facility is only running at 40 percent capacity and second-hand garments, which can sell at well below his production costs, are at least partly to blame.In response, East African Community (EAC) members Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda increased tariffs on used clothing in July 2016. Rwanda hiked import duties from 20 cents to $2.50 per kilogram.Those tariffs are now the center of a dispute between the US and Rwanda. If Rwanda continues to tax imported second-hand clothes, Trump Administration officials say, the country could lose some of its access to US markets for its exports. Rwanda has until May 28 to comply.'The president's determinations underscore his commitment to enforcing our trade laws and ensuring fairness in our trade relationships,' Deputy US Trade Representative C.J. Mahoney said, announcing the decision.No matter the outcome, the row is further straining Washington's relations with Africa at a time when it is being aggressively courted by America's global competitors, not least China.Made in RwandaUnder the US African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), qualifying African countries are granted duty-free access to the US market for 6,500 exported products. The law was, which passed in 2000, is credited for increasing Africa's export sector, with duty-free exports from the continent to the US market almost quadrupling to over $1 billion since the law was enacted.In March, the US warned Rwanda it would lose some benefits under the the act, after Rwanda increased tariffs on second-hand clothes to support its local garment industry. Trade officials acted after receiving a complaint in March last year from the Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles Association (SMART), a US-based organization which represents companies that collect and resell Americans' used clothing.Selling America's used clothing â€” much of it donated to charities and the bulk of it originally made outside the United States â€” is a nearly $1 billion industry. Exports typically end up in poor nations. Africa is a key destination. SMART said the EAC duty increase violated AGOA.'It basically was a shutdown in the market for my members,' SMART Executive Director Jackie King told Reuters. 'When Rwanda particularly wanted the duties increased by 1,100 percent, it just wasn't possible to do business there.'The fees also affected Rwandans.'Before, even with a little money, you could buy enough second-hand clothes for a child. But some children in my neighborhood are now naked,' Fillette Umugwaneza, 24, a mother of two told Reuters. 'It is a disgrace to our country.'Rwanda's government argues such hardships will be short-lived. Opening new factories will create more, better paid jobs, while expanding domestic consumption will cut its external trade deficit, it says.'Just in the last two or three years ... we've seen almost three times growth in production of garments and textiles for the economy,' said Clare Akamanzi, CEO of the Rwanda Development Board.Self-reliantThe current dispute, which also initially involved Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, has received none of the attention of Trump's trade war with China or his haggling with North American neighbors. Yet critics â€” including former US trade officials â€” see in it a worrying indication of how Washington will approach trade relations with Africa.'It delegitimizes so much of what we've worked for for so many years,' said Gail Strickler, who served as the top US trade official on textiles until 2015. 'I think it's horrible. I think it's sad. I think it's pathetic and I think it's obscene.''AGOA clearly has a criterion that the beneficiary countries must be eliminating barriers to US trade,' said Florie Liser, former Assistant US Trade Representative for Africa under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.'That's kind of always been there, but no one was looking to go after the AGOA countries.'Data compiled by agoa.info, an online information portal about AGOA run by the South Africa-based Trade Law Center, indicates that US used clothing exports to Rwanda in particular actually increased slightly in 2016. After a July 2017 hearing, Uganda and Tanzania followed Kenya's example and capitulated, agreeing to roll back tariffs to pre-2016 levels.Rwanda has held out. If it does not concede by the end of this month it faces losing duty-free access for its garment exports.'The United States has been explicit about what Rwanda must do to adhere to the AGOA eligibility criteria,' a US official told Reuters. 'It is up to Rwanda to make a decision.'The dispute has provoked dismay in Washington and Africa.'(Africans) are watching. They're shocked and they're livid,' said Rosa Whitaker, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton as the United States' first Assistant Trade Representative for Africa and helped draft the original AGOA legislation.She called the Trump administration's actions bullying and predicted they would backfire. 'African countries, from what they're telling me, are feeling abandoned. We've just ceded it to China.'Devotha Mukankusi is more matter of fact about the trade tiff. She's survived genocide and the Trump administration doesn't worry her, she said.'My message for Trump is that it won't affect us. We are determined to be self-reliant. We'll make our own clothes.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"PHILADELPHIA, March 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- President Trump's plan to place tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum has drawn dire warnings of starting a trade war. But the U.S. is already in a trade war, one that it is losing badly, says Made in America Again founder James A. Stuber. In his recent book, 'What if Things Were Made in America Again', Stuber describes how China and other countries use subsidies, low labor standards, lax regulations, and trade barriers to consistently sell far more to the U.S. than they buy.Made in America AgainRegarding the hue and cry that has arisen in opposition to the announced steel and aluminum tariffs, Stuber said:'It is disheartening to see how quick many U.S. companies are to throw under the bus those companies farther upstream in the supply chain, just to protect their own niche. But they are mistaken if they believe that they are not themselves vulnerable to the foreign competition: the Chinese and the other mercantilists want to occupy the entire supply chain, especially in high value-added products. This is all spelled out in China's 'Made in China 2025' plan.'I don't understand why we are hearing such vociferous objections to paying a fair price for steel, one that includes paying workers a living family wage and a modest profit for the company.'I don't understand why so many of us are ready to write off entire sectors of the American economy just so other sectors can enjoy the low prices resulting from unfair foreign competition.'At the strategic level, we must realize the necessity of self-sufficiency in such critical sectors as steel and aluminum.'At the human level, we must understand the devastating effects we are visiting upon individuals, families and communities. In my book, I provide the example of the U.S. Steel mill in Granite City, which closed in the face of Chinese overcapacity, idling its 2,000 workers. At the worst, one worker committed suicide. More typically, one worker told his son he could not return for his junior year to complete college, as his sister had before him.'In the postscript to his book, Stuber posed the question:Will the U.S. Steel mill in Granite City reopen? Or will it fall victim to the Chinese overcapacity in steel, and remain silent? I believe it is a metaphor for our future. As goes that mill, so will go our country.With the announcement of the steel and aluminum tariffs, U.S. Steel announced that it would restart two of the blast furnaces at the Granite City mill, returning 500 of the 2,000 laid-off employees to work.But what of the 1,500 other workers? 'This is only a first step,' Stuber said, 'and it demonstrates that policy, while important, is not sufficient. The only true relief will come when American consumers buy automobiles and washing machines made with the steel from plants like the one in Granite City.'The only true relief will come when we realize we're already in a trade war, and only consumers can win it.'About Made in America AgainMade in America Again is a movement of consumers dedicated to rebuilding the American middle class by buying things made in American communities (www.madeinamericaagain.org).

"The Special Report on the Impact of U.S. and Chinese Tariffs was conducted between September 21 and October 10, shortly after the additional US$200 billion in tariffs on Chinese products imposed by the Trump administration and the tariffs on US$60 billion on the U.S. products by the Chinese government. A total of 219 companies participated, of which one third are engaged in the manufacturing industry, more than one half in the service sector, and around one seventh in other industries. Roughly 95 percent of respondents have operations in China.The Study shows the combined tariffs have negatively impacted various industries and companies not only from the U.S. and China, but also those from different origins, affecting business operations and resulting in substantial loss of business volume and market share. Participants in the Study include companies from China, U.S., Canada, European Union, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong and Macau SARs. Nearly a half of the respondents report that they have lost market share to companies from other countries due to the trade war. Vietnam, Germany, and Japan are generally considered as the top three competitors particularly for the U.S. companies in imports and exports, while for the Chinese the competitions come from Vietnam, India, and Korea. Among all the participants, manufacturing companies are suffering more losses of market share than those in agribusiness.Chamber president Dr. Harley Seyedin said the immediate impact has not yet been completely felt by these businesses since much of the orders for export items from both countries had been placed long in advance of the dispute and in many cases few, if any, alternative sourcing options are available. 'The primary concerns at this point is that consumers in both nations may have to pay slightly more for many items now and likely much higher prices in the not too distant future,' Seyedin added.According to the Study, although plans for relocation of manufacturing lines outside of China are considered by a majority of respondents, only very few participants will give up the Chinese market. Instead, most of the respondents see the expansion of the Chinese market as one of the most important remedies for the imposed tariffs, which sheds light on the priority of the Chinese market. Meanwhile, it is interesting to note that just one percent of the Study participants indicate any plans for establishing manufacturing in North America.Both the U.S. and Chinese companies harbor low confidence in U.S.-China relations. Negative opinions towards imposed tariffs are widely shared by the business community. Meanwhile, more U.S. companies report that they are hurt in the trade tensions than their Chinese counterparts, particularly in terms of practical impact on the business operation, loss of business volume and market share. Nevertheless, the U.S. companies are more active in reacting towards the impact of the trade disputes.Seyedin said he is less worried about the present than he is about the future ramifications between the U.S. and China. 'What worries me the most is not so much the immediate impact,' Seyedin added, 'but the potential long-term loss of access by Chinese companies to the U.S. market and, as a result, American companies' access to a market that will eventually have five times as many consumers as the U.S.' He hopes that 'the Study, representing the factual points of view of participating companies from countries spanning the globe, will cause the leaders from both sides of the equation to pause and rethink their strategies. We suggest, as countless others have, that all differences can and should be resolved through friendly discussions.'About The American Chamber of Commerce in South ChinaThe American Chamber of Commerce in South China (AmCham South China) is a non-partisan, non-profit organization dedicated to facilitating bilateral trade between the United States and the People's Republic of China.

"Sep 27, 2018 ,China has only limited influence over the evolution of the rules-based world order. But, by upgrading its property-rights infrastructure, it can support shared prosperity and mutually beneficial engagement, potentially defusing some of the tensions that have lately been fueling instability worldwide.HONG KONG â€“ Last June, The Economist lamented that â€œDonald Trump is undermining the rules-based international order,â€? as he seeks â€œshort-term wins for Americaâ€? at the cost of â€œlong-term damage to the world.â€? With Trump now escalating his trade war with China â€“ and with both sides seeming to be girding for protracted competition over technological leadership â€“ the threat is only growing.Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images The Inconvenient Truth About Saudi Arabia Nov 20, 2018 advocates a measured Western response to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's increasingly wayward rule. Oliver Contreras-Pool/Getty Images US Foreign Policy After the Midterm Election Nov 21, 2018 warn that Trump will be tempted to divert public attention by ratcheting up conflicts abroad. Previous NextFor a long time, trade appeared to benefit everyone. This assumption underpinned a broad global consensus on trade rules, including the relatively consistent protection of property rights. China, for example, has managed to integrate itself into the global economy because its firms learned how to operate and compete within the framework established by the World Trade Organization.But, as the Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz has repeatedly pointed out, the neoliberal obsession with unfettered markets failed to account for the distributive costs of efficiency gains. Inequality has risen sharply, spurring many populations to become increasingly disillusioned not just with the specific factors fueling it, but with openness and globalization in virtually all its forms, including immigration and free trade.That is how Trump got elected. But the backlash is not exclusive to the US. The United Kingdomâ€™s vote to leave the European Union was driven by similar concerns, as has been the rise of right-wing populist political forces in many EU countries, from Italy to Poland. These political developments â€“ and they are political, not economic â€“ have spurred a process of re-writing, if not dismantling, the existing rules-based world order.This is forcing profound transformation at the national and international levels. But, as Stiglitz and Harvardâ€™s David Kennedy wrote in the 2013 book Law and Economics with Chinese Characteristics , â€œmarkets are built upon a foundation of legal arrangements and stabilized by a regulatory framework.â€? This means that addressing the distributive effects of market failures requires the construction of new judicial, administrative, and regulatory frameworks â€“ a process that will take time.China â€“ a favorite target of those who are attacking the rules-based global order â€“ is under particularly intense pressure to make changes. Because its market grew faster than its tax, regulatory, and judicial arrangements could evolve, the country was beset by rising income inequality, pollution, financial risks, and corruption â€“ all of which must be addressed in the next phase of structural reforms.The Black Friday Sale This weekend only, get unlimited access to On Point, The Big Picture, and the PS Archive, plus our annual magazine and a tote bag, for just $50. SUBSCRIBEWhat precisely those reforms should be, however, remains subject to heated debate among Chinaâ€™s elites, policymakers, and disadvantaged groups, as well as foreign stakeholders. And as the trade war with the US continues to escalate, calls for policy clarity are growing more urgent.Chinaâ€™s entrepreneurs and its rapidly expanding middle class are concerned, first and foremost, about their property rights, including the security of their accumulated wealth, amid regulatory tightening with regard to taxation, finance, cross-border capital flows, and even the environment. Meanwhile, Chinese young people and low-income households worry about high and rising home prices, job insecurity, and the fast-growing market power of a few tech giants squeezing small and medium-size enterprises.For their part, foreign businesses operating in China, as well as trade partners like the US, are focusing on inadequate protection of intellectual property rights, excessive government support of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and an industrial policy geared toward technological upgrading. Policymaking in this area here would also need to account for the disruptive impact of new technologies on business models, supply chains, lifestyles, and even politics within China.It is imperative that Chinaâ€™s leaders mount a firm and decisive response to these divergent and sometimes even conflicting concerns. This means pursuing a set of bold reforms that not only bolster confidence, but also strengthen Chinaâ€™s hand in negotiations with the US and foreign investors.The first step for China should be to reaffirm the authoritiesâ€™ 2013 commitment to ensuring that markets play a decisive role in allocating resources. If this commitment is to be credible, however, China must follow up by creating a level playing field for market competition among foreign companies, private Chinese firms, and SOEs.The good news is that far-reaching reforms can actually be easier to justify during periods of uncertainty, transition, or even crisis. Yet one important current factor could impede such action: risk-aversion on the part of local officials.In the past, local-level experimentation and innovation have proved integral to Chinaâ€™s progress, with competition among provinces, cities, and firms often helping the country to break out of bureaucratic and structural logjams. But, having watched as President Xi Jinpingâ€™s anti-corruption campaign has taken down their colleagues and bosses, many local officials now hesitate to pursue daring initiatives.Much as Deng Xiaoping did with his 1992 â€œsouth China tour,â€? Chinaâ€™s leaders today must redouble their efforts to unleash the â€œanimal spiritsâ€? of domestic businesses, while spurring local governments to spearhead their own reforms. Although trading partners like the US may object to the state-led nature of this approach, the end result will be more stable and dynamic markets.The key to success will be to strengthen the infrastructure of property-rights protection, including dispute-resolution mechanisms, the court system, and commercial and technological standards. To this end, the authorities would do well to look to the property-rights infrastructure in Hong Kong, the US, the UK, and elsewhere in Europe, which has remained stable and robust, despite political and social upheaval.China has only limited influence over the evolution â€“ or even survival â€“ of the rules-based world order. But, by bringing its property-rights arrangements into line with those of the advanced economies, it can support shared prosperity and mutually beneficial engagement, potentially defusing some of the tensions that have lately been fueling instability worldwide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"China's trade surplus with the USA was designed, possibly unintentionally, by USA corporations. Trying to batter down unions and such organisations looking out for the welfare of their members, corporation outsourced a lot of their industry to overseas companies, often subsidiaries set up for the purpose. They were too successful. Now China is no longer a developing economy so many loopholes it enjoys are ripe for renegotiation. It's biting back the US corporate world as it was bound eventually to do. The lack of aggregate demand in the private sector due to cuts in wages and unemployment bites into sales. Trump does not address this. He prefers to blame outside forces. He might do some good if the loopholes enjoyed by former developing nations get closed.It's worth remembering that China's trade surplus sits in the federal reserve, some in bonds . Japan's as well. All they can do is try to sell them or buy treasuries so as to get some interest on that money. It's like the US customers get real goods and services the exporters get numbers in accounts, like pieces of paper. Who gets the best deal?

"Donald Trump at the NBCUNIVERSAL 2015 Winter TCA Press Tour at The Langham Huntington Hotel (Shutterstock)Economist Noah Smith, a former assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University who is now a columnist for Bloomberg, has issued a stark warning to the conservative movement about where President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade war is taking the American economy.Writing on Twitter, Smith explains that the effects of Trumpâ€™s tariffs are just starting to be felt on the economy â€” and that things will only get worse in key battleground states in the months ahead.SPONSOREDâ€œThis is just the beginning,â€? he writes. â€œMore U.S. tariffs will hurt American companies more.

"Farmer inspecting his crops, photo by the United Soybean BoardPresident Donald Trumpâ€™s trade war against multiple countries has been hammering the price of American soybeans, and many farmers say theyâ€™re seriously feeling the pinch.The Los Angeles Times reports that soy farmers in Nebraska are increasingly anxious that Trumpâ€™s trade war could drag on into the fall, at which time they would suffer massive losses due to the low prices of their crops.SPONSOREDData released by the Labor Department this week revealed that American agricultural export prices plunged by 5.3 percent last month, which marks the biggest drop in export prices since October 2011.Soy bean farmers, which have been specifically targeted by Chinaâ€™s retaliatory tariffs against American imports, were particularly hard hit. According to Labor Department figures, U.S. soy export prices plunged by 14.1 percent in July, just after China slapped soy imports with 25 percent tariffs.â€œHeâ€™s gonna kill us,â€? 81-year-old farmer Joel Samuleson told the Los Angeles Times, referring to the drop in soy prices.Farmer Doug Saathoff, meanwhile, says that he likes the fact that Trump is a â€œbusinessman,â€? but he worries about the erratic nature of the presidentâ€™s trade negotiations.â€œHow long can I hold out?â€? he asked the Los Angeles Times, referring to his own farmâ€™s financial situation. â€œI donâ€™t know.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"* Loans: Business from China to take further hit as TMT sector gets in the crosshairsBy Prakash Chakravarti, Yan Jiang and Apple LamHong Kong, Oct 12 (LPC) - International lenders are taking the vetting of potential Chinese borrowers to previously unheard of lengths as the US-China trade war intensifies, dealing a further blow to already flagging syndicated loans to China.â€œFor any new borrowings, no matter bilateral or syndicated, we are first taking a careful look at the borrowersâ€™ exposure to the US market because of the escalating trade war. Thatâ€™s regardless of whether they are existing or new clients,â€? a banker at an international lender in Shanghai said.In the first nine months of the year, internationally syndicated lending to China was 15% lower, at US$72.62bn, than a year earlier because of the slowing Chinese economy and lower M&A activity. M&A loans from China were 46% lower in the first three quarters, at US$5.51bn, from a year earlier.Bankers see Chinaâ€™s manufacturing and technology, media and telecom sectors as the most at risk from the trade war, as tit-for-tat tariffs ratchet up the pressure on the countryâ€™s major exporters.â€œNo one wins in a trade war, but the immediate impact will be on the domestic economy in China. PRC suppliers to US companies are on the radar and most vulnerable in the current situation,â€? a senior loan banker in Hong Kong said.Chinaâ€™s TMT sector has raised only US$1.7bn of internationally syndicated loans this year with another US$600m in the market, which is the lowest volume since 2014, and pales in comparison to full-year amounts of US$11.6bn in 2017 and US$24.4bn in 2016.FEELING THE HEATIn addition to the trade war, Chinaâ€™s TMT is feeling the heat from increased scrutiny in the US over allegations of cyberwar, hacking and sanctions-busting, with the misadventures of some recent borrowers providing a cautionary tale to lenders.Super Micro Computer, which closed a US$285m 364-day loan in mid-April according to LPC data, for instance found itself in the spotlight on October 4 when Bloomberg reported that computer servers manufactured by the company had been infiltrated by malicious computer chips inserted by Chinese intelligence agents. Although the report was strongly denied by alleged targets of the spying, including Apple and Amazon, shares of US-listed Super Micro plunged 40% as a result.Bank of America Merrill Lynch was bookrunner on the April loan, which pays an interest margin of 275bp over Libor. East West Bank, CTBC Bank and MB Financial Bank participated in the loan.Similarly, telecom equipment maker ZTE has lost 46% of its value since mid-April when the US Department of Commerce imposed a trade ban, prohibiting American companies from selling to ZTE for seven years.Even so, the company was lucky to win consent from lenders to a request for a waiver of a covenant breach in June on a US$450m four-year loan signed in July 2014.Earlier this month, ZTEâ€™s problems got worse when a US judge ruled that it had violated a probation imposed in March 2017, when the company pleaded guilty for conspiring to evade US sanctions by illegally shipping US goods and technology to Iran, Reuters reported.Either borrower could have met a very different outcome if they had waited as lenders are becoming increasingly wary of Chinese companies with exposure to the US market. TARIFF HIT LIST Banks are wary of taking long-term exposure to Chinese borrowers because of the uncertainty and administrative cost of keeping up with constantly evolving tariffs.â€œFor every loan we assess, we need to check if the borrowerâ€™s products are on a list hit by US tariffs and evaluate whether it [the borrower] would be affected by the trade war. If those products are on the list, then I think it is very unlikely that the loan would get credit approval,â€? a loan banker at a Taiwanese lenderâ€™s overseas branch said.Last week US President Donald Trump repeated his threat to slap tariffs on US$267bn of additional Chinese imports if China retaliated for recent US moves in the escalating trade war and the US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin warned China not to engage in competitive devaluations of the renminbi.Taiwanese banks are among the biggest lenders to China, but, in late June, they were already approaching their regulatory country limits for the PRC and had started to slow lending to the countryâ€™s credits.According to Taiwanâ€™s Financial Supervisory Commission, Taipei Fubon Commercial Bank was already at 81% of its lending limit to Chinese borrowers, at that time, while Cathay United Bank was at 74%.Notwithstanding the trade war, the slowing Chinese economy remains a concern. Banksâ€™ credit committees now require regular financials from borrowers to keep their risk appraisals up to date in the fast-changing environment and are learning to live with a high level of uncertainty as growth continues to fall. Last Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund cut its 2019 growth forecast for the US to 2.5% from 2.7% previously and Chinaâ€™s to 6.2% from 6.4%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you want to know why Donald Trump shouldnâ€™t expect to win a trade war against China, look no further than Alibaba, the countryâ€™s giant e-commerce version of Amazon. Last month, I had two in-depth conversations with Ming Zeng, the e-commerce giantâ€™s head of strategic planning and among the smartest minds in business and finance in China. Ming made it clear that China has little real need for America any more â€“ not U.S. products, but especially not U.S. ideas. When thwarted, China has shown it can think up its own.A China Shipping container is loaded at a terminal Hamburg, Germany July 27, 2018. REUTERS/Fabian BimmerAt the same time, the Trump administration seems to be doing its level best to run a competition calculated from the starting gate to lose the race, or the war, whichever it turns out to be. The U.S. presidentâ€™s latest effort was to threaten a rise in tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods â€“ from 10 percent to 25 percent. Within 24 hours, China quickly reciprocated with a list of 5,207 American products, worth $60 billion, on which it pledged to exact new tariffs ranging from 5 to 25 percent if Trump implements his threats.And there weâ€™ll have a full-blown trade war.Fortunately, Trump has extended a comment period before implementation until September. Meanwhile, markets on both sides of the Pacific continue unsettled â€“ at times balancing on the edge of panic.While the Chinese stock market has taken more of a beating than the American, Trump seems to think that the United States can stand the pain longer than China and tightening the screws will bring Beijing to the negotiating table. But that reflects little understanding of either the Chinese mindset or the underlying strength of the Chinese economy which, though weaker than a year ago, is still growing nearly twice as fast as the American.And this by no means reflects how bad it could get as individuals with little understanding of either the stakes or the mechanisms plunge into this pending maelstrom.Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo unveiled with some fanfare another way of dealing with, even isolating China, that approaches the ridiculous in its scale and futility. Dubbed the â€œIndo Pacific Economic Vision Programâ€? it was widely viewed as a counter to Chinaâ€™s long-standing Belt and Road development initiative that has ensnared nations across Asia and onward to Europe. But a decidedly skinflint counter. Trump has committed a derisory $113 million to his program â€“ a rounding error compared with the $900 billion estimated for Beijingâ€™s Belt and Road, which China bankrolled at $82 billion three years ago. This hardly even seems to be a competition. Yet as the South China Morning Post put it, the U.S. initiative is â€œlikely to fuel suspicions from Beijingâ€¦ and could in turn worsen relations that are already fraught with trade tensions.â€?Moreover, China seems prepared to do all it can to keep control of its global trading strategy, offering Britain talks leading to a post-Brexit free trade deal on Monday, while continuing to hold the United States at bay.For Washington to win any trade war with Chinaâ€“or even arrive at some mutually satisfactory conclusion, the most desirable outcome in the long runâ€“there must be an understanding of the forces it will be facing. My takeaway from my interviews with Ming, which ran in full in Forbes Asia, as that large swaths of Chinaâ€™s rapidly advancing economy, especially the domestically-focused areas, are either largely immune from any trade imbroglios or will manage to circumvent them.In January, the United States barred a takeover by Alibabaâ€™s Ant Financial of Moneygram, the money transfer agency. So Alibaba created a different, in many respects more innovative, product using blockchain-based technology. â€œAny new business, while growing up, always encounters obstacles. We understand that. It is part of the cost of doing business,â€? Ming said. â€œSo we might be frustrated. But because the value we create is so overwhelming, we will find some way to overcome that barrier.â€?That doesnâ€™t mean that many Chinese companies and state-run enterprises in China arenâ€™t still poised to appropriate innovations from Silicon Valley. But the more America tries to block them, the more likely the Chinese are to come up with their own solutions.Another example: Last year, the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment failed to approve an effort by Navinfo, the Chinese provider of digital maps for autos, to buy a stake in HERE, an Amsterdam-based mapping company that operates in the United States and is 15 percent owned by U.S. chipmaker Intel. So Navinfo, ranked by Forbes as of the worldâ€™s top 100 innovative growth companies, simply withdrew its offer and continued its expanding cooperation with HERE and its German-owned car company partners, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen.To be sure, while China may have a leadership role in markets like the auto market and appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines, it does still lag in fields like artificial intelligence. But, as Ming suggests, â€œitâ€™s not about our size, itâ€™s about our innovation experience and our understanding of where the future goes.â€?Slideshow (2 Images)It is this profound understanding and acceptance of the long game that may ultimately leave China the winner in any trade war.The Chinese, and especially its leadership, have quite a strong and evolved sense of self. Their ability to withstand external forces dates back not just to Mao Zedong and the communist revolution that brought them to power after World War Two. Itâ€™s more useful to look back to the Zhou dynasty a thousand years before Christ, which based the legitimacy of its emperor on whether he was sufficiently virtuous to rule â€“ and receive the Mandate from Heaven to do so. A people with such an evolved sense of destiny and self-worth is unlikely to see a secular leader like Donald Trump as a major obstacle.In China, losing face is the ultimate failure. While the best, and most lasting, trade agreements must be at least perceived as a win-win, Trump now seems to have dug himself so deeply into his America First corner that it allows little room for the Chinese leadership to maneuver without losing that face. Trump must brace for a long and bruising conflict. But if he is not persuaded to give up, it is all Americans who must prepare to pay for his trade crusade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump pressed ahead on Thursday with import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent for aluminum but exempted Canada and Mexico and offered the possibility of excluding other allies, backtracking from an earlier â€œno-exceptionsâ€? stance.Describing the dumping of steel and aluminum in the U.S. market as â€œan assault on our country,â€? Trump said in a White House announcement that the best outcome would for companies to move their mills and smelters to the United States. He insisted that domestic metals production was vital to national security.â€œIf you donâ€™t want to pay tax, bring your plant to the USA,â€? added Trump, flanked by steel and aluminum workers.Plans for the tariffs, set to start in 15 days, have stirred opposition from business leaders and prominent members of Trumpâ€™s own Republican Party, who fear the duties could spark retaliation from other countries and hurt the U.S. economy.Within minutes of the announcement, U.S. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, a Trump critic, said he would introduce a bill to nullify the tariffs. But that would likely require Congress to muster an extremely difficult two-thirds majority to override a Trump veto.Some Democrats praised the move, including Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who said it was â€œpast time to defend our interests, our security and our workers in the global economy and that is exactly what the president is proposing with these tariffs.â€?Trumpâ€™s unexpected announcement of the tariffs last week roiled stock markets as it raised the prospect of an escalating global trade war. He appeared to have conceded some ground after concerted lobbying by Republican lawmakers, industry groups and U.S. allies abroad.Canada, the largest supplier of both steel and aluminum to the United States, welcomed the news it would not immediately be subject to the tariffs, but vowed to keep pressing Washington until the threat of tariffs had disappeared.Trump offered relief from steel and aluminum tariffs to countries that â€œtreat us fairly on trade,â€? a gesture aimed at putting pressure on Canada and Mexico to give ground in separate talks on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement.Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said NAFTA talks were â€œindependentâ€? of Trumpâ€™s tariff actions and should not be subject to outside pressure.In Beijing, Chinaâ€™s Commerce Ministry said on Friday it â€œresolutely opposedâ€? the tariffs and that they would â€œseriously impact the normal order of international trade.â€?While Chinese steel exports to the United States have been suppressed by previous anti-dumping duties, the broad â€œSection 232â€? national security tariffs are widely seen as aiming to pressure Beijing to cut excess steel and aluminum production capacity that has driven down global prices.U.S. steel stocks, which have gained for weeks on anticipation of the tariffs, fell after the announcement, with the Standard and Poorâ€™s composite steel index .SPCOMSTEEL ending down 2.53 percent against a half percent gain in the broad S&P 500 .SP500 index.U.S. President Donald Trump holds up a proclamation during a White House ceremony to establish tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 8, 2018. REUTERS/Leah MillisCentury Aluminum (CENX.O) shares fell 7.5 percent, while Alcoa (AA.N) dipped 0.9 percent. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso gained slightly against the U.S. dollar.SEEKING CLARITYA senior Trump administration official said other countries could seek talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to find â€œalternative waysâ€? to mitigate the threat to U.S. national security posed by their steel and aluminum exports to the United States.It was unclear whether they would involve quotas or voluntary export restraints, but the official said that permanent exemptions for Canada and Mexico might result in higher tariffs on other countries to maintain 80 percent capacity usage targets for domestic producers.European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said: â€œThe EU is a close ally of the U.S. and we continue to be of the view that the EU should be excluded from these measures. I will seek more clarity on this issue in the days to come.â€?U.S. steel- and aluminum-consuming industries sharply criticized the tariffs as damaging them with higher costs.â€œThe U.S. will become an island of high steel prices that will result in our customers simply sourcing our products from our overseas competitors and importing them into the United States tariff-free,â€? the Precision Metalforming and National Tooling and Machining associations said in a joint statement.Slideshow (5 Images)COUNTERMEASURES?Several major trading partners have said they might respond to the tariffs with direct action.Countermeasures could include European Union tariffs on U.S. oranges, tobacco and bourbon. Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N) motorcycles have also been mentioned, targeting Republican U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryanâ€™s home state of Wisconsin.Even as Trump threatened tariffs and prodded his NAFTA partners, 11 nations gathered in Chile to sign a landmark Asia-Pacific trade pact, one that Trump withdrew from on his first day in office last year.Trump, who won the White House after a career in real estate and reality TV, has long touted economic nationalism, promising to bring back jobs to the United States and save the country from trade deals he views as unfair. That has put him at odds with many in his Republican Party, traditionally a supporter of free trade.(For a graphic on 'Global trade and GDP growth' click reut.rs/2FtPzhW)(For a graphic on 'U.S. visible trade balance' click reut.rs/2Fmon8N)(For a graphic on 'U.S. steel imports by country' click reut.rs/2Fkjb5g)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke(Reuters) - Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) on Wednesday flagged headwinds for its 2018 earnings mainly due to fewer-than-expected Mercedes-Benz SUV sales and likely higher costs resulting from increased import tariffs for U.S. vehicles into the Chinese market.The automaker also said the effect of tariffs cannot be fully compensated by reallocating vehicles to other markets.The company said its profit will also be hurt by a new vehicle certification process, recall of some diesel vehicles and declining demand for its buses in Latin America.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germanyâ€™s Daimler (DAIGn.DE) cut its 2018 profit forecast and BMW (BMWG.DE) said it was looking at â€œstrategic optionsâ€? because of a trade war between China and the United States, sparking fears of a wave of earnings downgrades in the auto industry.Daimler said late on Wednesday that import tariffs on cars exported from the United States to China would hurt sales of its Mercedes-Benz cars, resulting in slightly lower earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) this year.The luxury automaker, one of the biggest global companies to cut its guidance and blame trade tensions, previously saw 2018 EBIT rising slightly.â€œWe do not believe Daimler will be the only OEM (original equipment manufacturer) to reduce guidance. Other OEMs are also exposed to similar trends that Daimler cites in various degrees,â€? Morgan Stanley analysts said.German rival BMW, which also exports sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) from the United States to China and Europe, reaffirmed its profit forecasts for this year, but said these depended on worldwide political conditions remaining largely unchanged.â€œWithin the context of the current discussion concerning additional tariffs on international trade, the company is evaluating various scenarios and possible strategic options,â€? it said in a statement on Thursday, without elaborating.Slower sales of SUVs from the Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama to China will result in a hit of around 250 million euros ($289 million), Evercore ISI analysts said.Daimler shares closed down 4.3 percent at 57.86 euros, while shares in BMW and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) closed down 3.1 and 2.9 percent, respectively.Daimlerâ€™s profit warning comes as U.S. President Donald Trump is proposing to impose tariffs on imported vehicles on the grounds that trade imbalances on many products threaten U.S. national security.He is separately threatening to impose tariffs on up to $200 billion of Chinese goods. China has warned it will retaliate with levies on U.S. products, potentially including the Mercedes-Benz SUVs shipped to China from Alabama.Stocks in a wide range of companies have see-sawed in recent weeks as investors tried to assess the risk to corporate profits from the Trump administrationâ€™s trade policy.FILE PHOTO: Mercedes S-Class (S-Klasse) cars park at the final quality check at the production line of at the Mercedes Benz factory in Sindelfingen, Germany, January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File PhotoWhile the United States and China have not yet imposed new tariffs, Daimler said it expected them, and would not be able to recover the costs from customers.â€œFewer-than-expected SUV sales and higher-than-expected costs, not completely passed on to the customers, must be assumed because of increased import tariffs for U.S. vehicles into the Chinese market,â€? it said in a regulatory filing.Daimlerâ€™s revised forecast came on the same day as reports that German automakers had backed a proposal that the European Union drop tariffs on vehicles to defuse trade tensions.Beijingâ€™s proposed 25 percent tax on U.S. car factory exports will hit nearly 270,000 vehicles, with German carmakers accounting for $7 billion of the $11 billion total.BMW, the largest vehicle exporter from the United States by value, has its largest factory in Spartanburg, South Carolina and faces a $965 million impact from tariffs, with Daimler exposed to a $765 million hit, Evercore ISI analysts have said.Around 18 percent of all BMWs sold in China were exported from the United States last year, and the carmaker has warned a further escalation of the trade row â€œwould be harmful for all stakeholdersâ€?.One way to mitigate its exposure to tariffs would be to move some production of its X5 offroader which is currently exported from the United States to a factory in China. BMW declined to comment on whether this was under consideration.BMW has already stopped exporting the X3 from the United States to China this year, amid escalating trade tensions, shifting manufacturing of the model to a plant in Rosslyn, South Africa and another factory in Shenyang, China.LOWER EMISSIONS, PROFITDaimler also said a new vehicle certification process based on stricter fuel efficiency test procedures would hit sales in the second half of the year, and warned earnings at Mercedes-Benz Vans unit would suffer because of a vehicle recall for diesel-engined models.Several carmakers including Volkswagen have said they face challenges adapting their vehicle fleets to meet the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), which is based on real-driving data rather than theoretical scenarios.FILE PHOTO: The Daimler logo is seen before the Daimler annual shareholder meeting in Berlin, Germany, April 5, 2018. REUTERS/Hannibal HanschkeBecause the new regime gives higher carbon dioxide readings than the old system, it will force some carmakers to delay road certification and sales, or push vehicles into a higher tax bracket.â€œThe elephant in the room at the moment is the response of national governments â€“ and manufacturers â€“ to the new WLTP emissions and fuel economy testing procedure, which has the potential to cause significant tax increases in countries which have taxation regimes based on CO2 emissions,â€? analysts at LMC said this month.Daimler now sees EBIT at Mercedes-Benz Cars slightly below a year earlier, compared with previous guidance for a slight rise.It sees earnings at the vans division dropping significantly after German regulator KBA last month ordered the recall of Mercedes-Benz Vito vans fitted with 1.6 litre diesel engines, saying they breached emissions rules.Daimler, which has said it will appeal KBAâ€™s decision, previously expected earnings at the vans business to decline only slightly.Overall, Daimlerâ€™s EBIT will take a hit of about 763 million euros once costs of the recall, the impact of WLTP certification and lower sales in Latin America are factored in to results, Evercore ISI analysts said.TRADING HITShares in South Korean automakers fell in Asian trade, while Japanese peers also came under pressure.Japanese and South Korean automakers for the most part do not ship vehicles made in the United States to China. Most of the vehicles sold in China are made locally through their Chinese joint ventures, along with imports from Asia.But analysts said the U.S. trade spat with China raised concerns about knock-on effects on other countries, like potential U.S. auto tariffs on all vehicle imports.â€œSouth Koreans have higher portions of vehicle imports in the U.S. than peers, making them vulnerable to U.S. potential tariffs,â€? Kwon Soon-woo, an analyst at SK Securities, said.Kia Motors (000270.KS) shares fell 2.2 percent, while Hyundai Motors (005380.KS) dropped 1.9 percent.For a graphic on U.S. trade with China, please click on: tmsnrt.rs/2LdzJv4($1 = 0.8655 euros)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chinaâ€™s absence from the U.S. soybean market has put tremendous pressure on both soybean growers and Chicago-traded soybean futures over the last several months. But the United Statesâ€™ new trade pact with Mexico and Canada may offer some hope for a similar outcome with major U.S. trade partner China.Soybeans are loaded into a truck at the Ruff Brothers Grain elevator in Leonore, Illinois, U.S., July 6, 2018. REUTERS/Daniel Acker - RC1B919D4680The United States and Canada reached a deal late on Sunday to salvage the three-country, $1.2 trillion open-trade zone agreement with Mexico that was on the verge of collapse after more than two decades. The agreement is expected to be signed at the end of November and will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).The deal has been viewed as a win for President Donald Trump and his strategy in the international trade arena. Trump had been an open critic of NAFTA even before his November 2016 election, and he vowed to supplant it if elected.But U.S. soybean farmers might be having trouble seeing the end game of Trumpâ€™s trade actions with China. The ongoing U.S. harvest will surge to a new record partially due to the assumption that China, which usually accounts for about 60 percent of U.S. soybean exports annually, would continue to participate in the U.S. market.The United States slapped $200 billion in tariffs against Chinese goods last month and China still refused to make concessions. Beijingâ€™s July 6 imposition of a 25 percent tariff on U.S. soybean imports has perhaps been the biggest burden on U.S. agriculture resulting from trade disputes.But Trump has confidence these harsh tariffs will ultimately pave the path to a deal, and Sundayâ€™s agreement certainly supports his claims. The U.S. president said on Monday that a trade deal would not have been reached with Canada and Mexico without the strong leverage created by the tariffs.So, could the tariffs eventually bring China to the negotiating table? Perhaps, but Trump thinks it is too soon to talk with China on trade because a forced decision may not end up being the best one for the country.China has been largely absent from the U.S. soybean market since early April when Beijing initially threatened to target U.S. beans with tariffs. The lack of Chinese demand and the record-yielding U.S. crop may push domestic soybean supply close to 900 million bushels by next August, well above the previous record carryout of 574 million in 2006-07.Trump noted on Monday that signs of economic weakness in China and its sliding stock markets are proof that the U.S. tariffs are impacting the Chinese economy. But just how long can China hold out, especially when it comes to soybeans?CHINAâ€™S TOOL CHESTThe next interaction between the United States and China could come at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires on Nov. 30, though economic adviser Larry Kudlow said a pact with Beijing was not imminent.Chinaâ€™s peak weeks for buying U.S. soybeans typically fall in October and November. On average over the last five years, China has secured roughly 77 percent of its annual U.S. soybean purchases by Nov. 30.Through Sept. 20, it has 1.3 million tonnes on the books for 2018-19 compared with 8 million on the same date a year ago.As of Sept. 30, soybean stocks at Chinese ports were at an all-time high of 8.8 million tonnes, some 30 percent more than a year ago. Given the average rate at which China consumes soybeans, these stocks would last just over four weeks.The U.S. Department of Agriculture puts current Chinese soybean supply at 22.5 million tonnes, not including the expected crop of 15 million, which together would last the country through at least January. However, soybeans are grown very far from the countryâ€™s crushing facilities, which is a huge cost consideration for the users.Market participants are not entirely clear on Chinaâ€™s stock situation. But assuming the USDA numbers are in the ballpark, Chinese buyers could theoretically remain sidelined from U.S. soybeans through most of their primary exporting season, though it may be difficult and costly. Top supplier Brazil could start shipping larger volumes of soybeans as early as late February if the harvest is large enough and without delay.One key difference between Mexico and China was that as trade tensions escalated with Mexico earlier this year, political pressures or other barriers did not prevent Mexican buyers from snatching up cheap U.S. corn and soybeans. Soy purchases rose well above record levels beginning in March, and corn sales also started pulling away.Mexico is the top buyer of U.S. corn and is usually No. 2 in U.S. soybeans, though through late September it had purchased more beans than China for delivery in 2018-19. Through Sept. 20, Mexico had 1.97 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans on the books.Canada, China and Mexico are the top three destinations for U.S. exports of agricultural and related products, amounting to $68.2 billion last year, some 43 percent of the total. Canada accounted for $16.4 billion in consumer-oriented products such as prepared foods, fresh produce, and meat, while China took in $12.3 billion in soybeans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are three other tankers in the Pacific that left the United States in June or July without a destination listed; they could still end up in China.As the trade war between the two nations heated up, China threatened in June to put levies on U.S. energy exports, though it did not include LNG in that mix.China, which became the worldâ€™s second biggest LNG importer in 2017, is buying more gas as the government tries to wean the country off dirty coal as part of its push to reduce pollution.The United States is expected to become the worldâ€™s third biggest LNG exporter by capacity in 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BEIJING (Reuters) - At least three U.S. coal shipments on their way to China may end up casualties of the escalating trade dispute after Beijing said it would impose steep tariffs that may kick in before the ships reach their destinations.The coal bulk ship Navios Taurus is seen en route to China in this illustration photo of an Eikon ship-tracking screen June 21, 2018. REUTERS/Thomas White/IllustrationThe addition of coal to the list of more than 650 items facing higher tariffs came as a shock to Chinese steel mills and trading firms that just last month were encouraged by Beijing to buy more U.S. coal to narrow the trade gap, four sources with knowledge of the plan said.Although 545 items on the list face higher tariffs starting July 6, Beijing did not specify when coal and the other remaining items would be hit.But coalâ€™s presence on the list has sent shudders through the market.â€œI am really worried. I havenâ€™t found buyers interested in these cargoes now,â€? said the manager of Shanghai Runhe International Trade Co, which has three shipments of U.S. coking coal en route to China.He said Runhe had paid for the coal up front rather than using letters of credit from banks.â€œWho knows what Trump is going to do next? In the worst scenario, we lost some money,â€? he added. He declined to be named because of company policy.A cargo of U.S. coking coal, depending on the size of the vessel, can be worth $10 million to $30 million.From late 2014 until January 2017, China bought no coal from the United States, as it typically costs more, takes longer to arrive and is of lower quality than Australian coal.Purchases resumed at a lower level after President Donald Trump took office, Thomson Reuters Eikon data show. Replacing American shipments with coal from other places would not be difficult, the sources said.Wang, a private coal trader who had planned to buy U.S. coal from Runhe, said he was changing course.â€œThat plan is now completely off the table,â€? said Wang, who is based in Rizhao.â€œWe were mystified by the trade policies. In May, my reading of the policy was that China is to step up U.S. coal buying to contribute to imports,â€? he added. Wang declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the topic.He is not the only one alarmed.An executive with the trading arm of a major Chinese building materials company said it had stopped talks with U.S. coal producers.â€œWe resumed our talks with U.S. coal producers recently,â€? the executive said. â€œBut our talks are stopped now.â€?She added that the company had not been prepared for the policy reversal. She declined to be named due to company policy.Trade flow data from Thomson Reuters Eikon showed that the three coal shipments, the only confirmed cargoes in transit from the United States to China, are heading to Jintang port in Hebei province.One vessel, the Navios Taurus, loaded 65,000 tonnes in late May in Mobile, Ala., and is estimated to arrive on July 18 - 12 days after some of the proposed tariffs are set to kick in.Another Vessel, named partnership, carrying 164,000 tonnes of coal from Virginia, is due to arrive at Jingtang port on June 26.To view a map of U.S. coal cargoes heading for China, click: reut.rs/2K2DvXdThe cargoesâ€™ owners might risk a credit downgrade if they cannot find buyers fast enough, making it harder to borrow in the future, the building materials executive said.â€œThe owners of those two cargoes must be on a hot pan now,â€? she said.A third vessel, the West Trader, completed loading of 161,000 tonnes of coal in Baltimore on Monday. Its listed destination is China, and it is scheduled to arrive on Aug. 10. Reuters was not able to identify the buyer of that cargo.Shanghai Runhe declined to say whether it owned any of the three vessels.RELIEVEDSome steel mills did not buy coking coal from the U.S. despite political pressure.â€œWe are much relieved that we donâ€™t need to buy U.S. coal now,â€? an executive from one of Chinaâ€™s 10 largest steel producers said. She declined to be named because of company policy.She said that authorities told her mill in late May to buy more coking coal from the United States, but that the company couldnâ€™t make any deals because of unattractive prices and higher shipping costs.U.S. coking coal typically costs three times more and takes three times longer to arrive than coal from Australia, data show. U.S. supplies can also be of poorer quality because of high sulphur content and low heating efficiency.The coal bulk ships West Trader, Navios Taurus and Partnership are seen en route to China in this illustration photo of an Eikon ship-tracking screen June 21, 2018.

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Major Asian nations reacted sharply on Friday to U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, warning of damage to relations amid industry calls for retaliation.Japan said the move would have a â€œbig impactâ€? on the countriesâ€™ close bilateral ties, while China said it was â€œresolutely opposedâ€? to the decision and South Korea said it may file a complaint to the World Trade Organization.Trump on Thursday pressed ahead with the imposition of 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminum on Thursday, though he announced exemptions for Canada and Mexico, and said exceptions could also be made for other allies.China, which produces half the worldâ€™s steel, will assess any damage caused by the U.S. move and â€œfirmly defend its legitimate rights and interests,â€? the countryâ€™s Ministry of Commerce said.The tariffs would â€œseriously impact the normal order of international trade,â€? the ministry said.The European Union, Brazil and Argentina said overnight they should not be targeted or would seek exemptions, and both Japan and South Korea said they would ask to be made exceptions also.South Korea, a key Washington Asian ally, is the third largest steel exporter to the United States, after Canada and Brazil.Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2oPeo1zThe U.S. is the worldâ€™s biggest importer of steel, purchasing 35 million tonnes of raw material in 2017. Of those imports, South Korea, Japan, China and India accounted for 6.6 million tonnes.â€œWe should prevent a trade war situation from excessive protectionism, in which the entire world harm each other,â€? Trade Minister Paik Un-gyu told a meeting with steelmakers.Trade tensions between China and United States have risen since Trump took office. China accounts for only a small fraction of U.S. steel imports, but its massive industrial expansion has helped create a global glut of steel that has driven down prices.Chinaâ€™s steel and metals associations urged the government to retaliate against the United States, citing imports ranging from stainless steel to coal, agricultural products and electronics.It was the most explicit threat yet from the country in an escalating trade spat.The dispute has fueled concerns that soybeans, the United Statesâ€™ most valuable export to the worldâ€™s second largest economy, might be caught up in the trade actions after Beijing launched a probe into imports of U.S. sorghum, a grain used in animal feed and liquor.FILE PHOTO: Workers check steel bars at a factory of Dongbei Special Steel Group Co., Ltd. in Dalian, Liaoning province, China November 27, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer/File Photoâ€œThe cost of a trade war will be tremendous and it will make everyone unhappy,â€? Junichi Makino, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo, said in a report on Friday.TRANSSHIPMENTSTrumpâ€™s declaration coincided with the signing by 11 countries of a new Trans-Pacific trade pact that the United States withdrew from last year.The announcement underlines concerns about rising U.S. protectionism and the latest tariffs offset the positive impact from plans also announced overnight for Trump to meet with North Koreaâ€™s Kim Jong Un that raised hopes of ending a standoff over North Koreaâ€™s nuclear weapons program, said Kwon Young-sun, an economist at Nomura Securities.While carrying a message to Washington to push forward a diplomatic breakthrough over North Korea, South Koreaâ€™s national security office chief Chung Eui-yong requested U.S. officials to support South Koreaâ€™s request for a waiver on the steel tariffs, a South Korean presidential spokesman said.Trump in January ordered tariffs on solar panels and washing machines imports to the United States.Exports of these products and steel and aluminum make up less than 1 percent of South Koreaâ€™s total exports, Young-sun said.â€œBut broader U.S. curbs and countermeasures from Europe or China could derail the exports environment going forward,â€? he said.Slideshow (3 Images)A senior South Korean official said the tariffs would impact the renegotiation of the bilateral free trade deal with the United States that is currently underway.The official said ways had to be found to address steel overcapacity in China as South Korea was the top importer of Chinese steel, although shipments from China were 21 percent down in 2017 from the previous year.He said the United States has raised concerns over South Koreaâ€™s â€œtransshipmentâ€? of Chinese steel, although the trade ministry has argued that only 2.4 percent of steel exported to the U.S. uses Chinese material.The official also expect higher U.S. tariffs to put South Korean carmakers, Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) and Kia Motors (000270.KS), at a disadvantage in the U.S. market as it would increase their costs.In Sydney, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull sounded confident of getting favorable treatment as Trump spoke of Washingtonâ€™s strong relationship with Australia, a major exporter of iron ore but exports little steel and the United States was not a major customer.â€œI was pleased to see the president acknowledge the strong points I have been making to him. There is no case for imposing tariffs on Australian steel,â€? Turnbull told reporters in Sydney.Indiaâ€™s steel ministry said in a note to the trade ministry last month that U.S. import tariffs were expected to lead to a loss of $130 million in exports which were expected to total 333,656 tonnes for the year ending on March 31.European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom will host her U.S. and Japanese counterparts in Brussels on Saturday to discuss steel overcapacity as part of talks that begin in December at a World Trade Organization meeting in Buenos Aires.Shares in Chinaâ€™s steel and aluminum makers fell on Friday morning. Baoshan Iron & Steel (600019.SS) was down 3.3 percent by 0616 GMT, while Hesteel (000709.SZ) and Beijing Shougang (000959.SZ) were down more than 1 percent.In South Korea, shares in Posco 0054900.KS were down 3.5 percent, while in Tokyo Japanâ€™s biggest steelmaker Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal (5401.T) fell 0.7 percent by the close.Chinese steel futures slumped to their weakest level since November.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade war with China is â€œon holdâ€? after the worldâ€™s largest economies agreed to drop their tariff threats while they work on a wider trade agreement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday.Mnuchin and U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the agreement reached by Chinese and American negotiators on Saturday set up a framework for addressing trade imbalances in the future.â€œWe are putting the trade war on hold. Right now, we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework,â€? Mnuchin said in a television interview on â€œFox News Sunday.â€?On Saturday, Beijing and Washington said they would keep talking about measures under which China would import more energy and agricultural commodities from the United States to narrow the $335 billion annual U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China.During an initial round of talks this month in Beijing, Washington demanded that China reduce its trade surplus by $200 billion. No dollar figure was cited in the countriesâ€™ joint statement on Saturday.The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return a request for comment on Mnuchinâ€™s statement.Tension between the two sides has been growing since the Trump administration proposed tariffs of $50 billion on Chinese goods and said it might extend the levies to an additional $150 billion. China responded with its own measures targeting U.S. agriculture.The top U.S. trade official, Robert Lighthizer, said that getting China to open its market to more U.S. exports was significant, but that it was far more important for the United States to resolve issues with China such as forced technology transfers and cyber theft.â€œReal structural change is necessary. Nothing less than the future of tens of millions of American jobs is at stake,â€? U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer said in a statement on Sunday.In response to Mnuchinâ€™s comments, Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a frequent Trump critic, said he thought it would be a mistake for Trump to settle for â€œa promise to buy goodsâ€? with so many larger issues on the table.FILE PHOTO: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin (R) is seen as he and a U.S. delegation for trade talks with China arrive at a hotel in Beijing, China May 3, 2018. REUTERS/Jason Leeâ€œIf President Xi is going ... to fail to take strong actions on intellectual property, cyber theft, and American companies having free access to sell goods in China ... we will have lost,â€? Schumer said.Kudlow told CBS â€œFace the Nationâ€? it was too soon to lock in the $200 billion figure for Chinaâ€™s promised purchases. â€œThe details will be down the road. These things are not so precise,â€? he said.In addition, he told ABCâ€™s â€œThis Weekâ€? that the broader issues were still in play, and that China had â€œstructural reformsâ€? such as lowering tariffs and non-tariff barriers that will allow the United States to boost exports.Trump was in a â€œvery positive mood about this,â€? Kudlow said.However, he said there was no trade deal yet reached.â€œThereâ€™s no agreement for a deal,â€? Kudlow told ABC. â€œWe never anticipated one. Thereâ€™s a communique between the two great countries, thatâ€™s all. And in that communique, you can see where weâ€™re going next.â€?One next step will be dispatching Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to China to look at areas where there will be significant increases, including energy, liquefied natural gas, agriculture and manufacturing, Mnuchin and Kudlow said.Mnuchin said the United States expects to see a big increase of between 35 percent and 40 percent in agricultural exports to China this year alone and a doubling of energy purchases over the next three to five years.â€œWe have specific targets. I am not going to publicly disclose what they are. They go industry by industry,â€? Mnuchin said.Saturdayâ€™s statement made no mention of whether there would be a relaxation of paralyzing restrictions on Chinese telecommunications equipment maker ZTE Corp imposed last month by the U.S. Commerce Department.FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump's economic adviser Larry Kudlow is interviewed at the White House in Washington, DC, U.S., April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File PhotoThe action was related to violation of U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea and banned American companies from selling semiconductors and other components to ZTE, causing the Shenzhen-based company to cease most operations.Trump said last week he had directed Ross to put ZTE back in business, but Kudlow said any changes would be minimal.â€œIf any of the remedies are altered they are still going to be very, very, tough, including big fines, compliance measures, new management, new boards,â€? he said. â€œDo not expect ZTE to get off scot-free.

"Illinois might be the largest soybean producer in the U.S., but Iowa is the state most economically dependent on exports of the good to China, whose buyers are canceling orders.Iowaâ€™s soybean exports account for 6 percent of gross state productâ€”4 percent to China aloneâ€”leaving the Hawkeye State the most exposed in a trade war.For comparison, Missouri has the second-most exposure with soybean exports comprising a mere 1.8 percent of its GSP, according to Moodyâ€™s Investors Service:In April, China canceled a net 196,400 metric tons of soybean purchases from the US for the marketing year ending August 31, 2018. While this is a small portion of the more than 30 million metric tons exported from the US to China in 2017, soy exports to China overall are down more than 20% this marketing year to date, according to US Department of Agriculture data. A lasting soybean boycott would reduce soybean prices overall as US producers seek buyers for their product, negatively affecting farm incomes.Agricultural commodity prices falling 15 percentage points since 2013 saw Iowa farm income decline from 7 percent of state personal income to 1 percent.Net general fund revenue growth in Iowa has gone from 7 percent in 2013 to 2 percent year over year, per Moodyâ€™s, and â€œoverly optimisticâ€? forecasts forced the state to tap into its rainy day fund and make $35 million in cuts this spring.In the short term, the 25 percent tariff on soybeans China is threatening in retaliation for a slew of U.S. tariffsâ€”imposed in an attempt to curb the nation-stateâ€™s theft of intellectual property and other hostile trade practicesâ€”wonâ€™t have a substantial impact on Iowaâ€™s finances.

"Trade wars between the United States and China could benefit Russia, according to the Russian Economic Development Minister Maksim Oreshkin. With tariffs growing, Russia could substitute American goods in China and India.These trade wars, these difficult relations between the United States and its trading partners is, first of all, an opportunity that opens on those markets. The US is exporting many goods and services to China and India. The bilateral raise of duties makes such production less competitive,Oreshkin told RT.â€œAll this opens niches Russia could fill in. Russia could compete in this sectors by offering its own production,â€? he added.China and the US have recently exchanged with a fresh round of tariffs. China added $60 billion of US products to its import tariff list on Tuesday as retaliation to US duties on $200 billion of Chinese goods, which go into effect on September 24. The measure comes into effect next week.Read moreEarlier, US President Donald Trump threatened China with further tariffs on around $267 billion of imports if Beijing retaliates against the latest measure, which it did.India is also one of several countries that President Trump has repeatedly criticized for its high trade surplus with the US. The US trade deficit with India stands at $30 billion, according to statistics from Washington.The US has imposed aluminum and steel tariffs on India that cost the Indian economy almost $250 million a year. India has pledged retaliation but has postponed the decision twice, this time to November.Speaking about Russia-India trade ahead of President Vladimir Putinâ€™s October visit to New Delhi, Oreshkin said the countries need to diversify their business ties from oil and gas.â€œTo be honest, despite that we are signing new contract with India and trade is growing, there is large room for diversification of trade from energy supplies,â€? he said.

"One wonders what went on in Russian minds during last monthâ€™s spectacle of US President Trump raking Beijing over the coals on accusations of meddling, in the upcoming US midterm elections, to try to undermine his trade policies.Certainly the Chinese, who evidently didnâ€™t expect it, were shocked and outraged, but it was behavior to which Moscow was accustomed to being on the receiving end of â€“ this time aimed at someone else for a change.Geng Shuang, Chinaâ€™s Foreign Ministry spokesman, called Donald Trumpâ€™s claims â€œtotally far-fetched and fictional,â€? and advised the â€œUS side to stop its unwarranted accusations and slander against China and refrain from wrong words and deeds that might hurt our bilateral relations and fundamental interests.â€?Read moreUndeterred, Vice President Mike Pence picked up the same theme earlier this month, even accusing Beijing of what amounts to an effort at regime change in the United States: â€œChina has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion, the 2018 elections, and the environment leading into the 2020 presidential elections,â€? said Trumpâ€™s No. 2. â€œTo put it bluntly, President Trumpâ€™s leadership is working; and China wants a different American President.â€? Beijing called the charge â€œridiculousâ€? and â€œmalicious slander.â€?Some observers, such as Harry J. Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest (â€œThe Coming American-Russian Alliance Against Chinaâ€?) and former Indian diplomat M. K. Bhadrakumar suggest his is part of a long term strategy (â€œTrump Has a Grand Strategy, He Wants to Do a 'Reverse Nixon' - Partner Russia for an Alliance vs Chinaâ€?) and see the new US verbal belligerence against Beijing as evidence that Washington intends a shift in â€œtriangulation.â€? This, as they see it, would mean a flip of Nixonâ€™s pivot to Beijing against Moscow, this time with the US cozying up to Russia to take on China.Clearly, theyâ€™re at least half wrong. Washington canâ€™t woo Moscow on the basis of the unremitting hostility, threats, sanctions, and provocations â€“ always increasing, never decreasing. Also, given past broken promises, for example on NATO expansion, the Russians would have no reason to trust any American overtures, which arenâ€™t being made in any case. Also, as neighbors with a 2,500-plus mile border and a lot to gain by cooperation, notably in Eurasian economic integration, Russia and China have more incentive to work with each other than either has with the US, plus every reason to avoid hostility at the behest of a power on the other side of the world.But the â€œtriangulationistsâ€? are also half right in their perception of the thinking of the US policy making class: China indeed is rapidly entering the category of prospective enmity of the sort with which Washington has long regarded Russia (and which in fact never really stopped with the end of the USSR).Some analysts, such as Caitlin Talmadge, a security expert at Georgetown University in Washington DC, writes in Foreign Affairs that a war between the two countries is currently unlikely, but â€œno longer seems as implausible as it once didâ€¦ The odds of such a confrontation going nuclear are higher than most policymakers and analysts think.â€?Read moreWhile Secretary of Defense James Mattisâ€™ recent trip to China may have been aimed at mitigating the risk of an inadvertent clash between US and Chinese forces, it canâ€™t have done much to reduce the impact of deliberate policies designed to preserve US hegemony in the western Pacific â€“ and globally.Whether or not Trump himself inclines in this direction, there is no question that this is the vector of the US establishment. As described in the January 2018 National Defense Strategy, the pretense that combating Islamic terrorism is the guiding star of US policy is out, and what Mattis dubbed rivalry in a new â€œgreat power competitionâ€? is in. This means the US against Russia and China, in that order.Nothing more needs be said here with regard to Russiaâ€™s effectively permanent adversary status. But with respect to China, this means treating Beijing as a potential enemy on a number of fronts, especially if it involves Chinese cooperation with Russia. (The counterproductive impact of pushing Russia and China even closer together is evidently lost on US planners.)For example, in September, Washington slapped sanctions on the Central Military Commission of China because of its purchase of 10 Russian Su-35 and equipment for surface-to-air S-400 missiles. Ostensibly, the action was triggered by a Chinese violation of US sanctions against Russia for 2016 election meddling, but the real issue is Chinaâ€™s strategic relationship with Russia.This does not mean there are not different priorities on China within the US establishment. Even within the Trump administration, the â€œtrade hawksâ€? are largely internally focused on the US economy and industrial base; what they mainly seek is a change in the US trade relationship with China. Conversely, the neoconservatives and national security hawks who dominate Trumpâ€™s national security team see China as a rising strategic foe (comparable to their view of Russia) but at a more distant future point.The trade hawks are happy to support the security hawksâ€™ anti-China initiatives not because they particularly care about them but because they see them as pressure to â€œsoften upâ€? Beijing on trade. These pressures include continual air and naval prodding in the South China Sea; trying to undercut the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which also likely includes covert proxy support for jihadists in Xinjiang and Myanmarâ€™s Rakhine State; and finding an excuse to maintain a military presence on the Korean peninsula. Trumpâ€™s national security team is skeptical of his Korea policy, because of the fear that Pyongyang wonâ€™t denuclearize, and even worse that it might, depriving them of an excuse to keep US troops on the East Asian mainland as a counter to China and Russia and will link South Korea up with BRI.READ MORE: Beijing slams US military â€˜provocationsâ€™ after B-52 bombers fly over South & East China SeasConversely the security hawks care little about trade (except to the extent they see Chinaâ€™s surplus as a boon for military production) but welcome a tariff war as a way to squeeze Beijingâ€™s economy and, hence, its military capacity â€“ which is perceived as such by the Chinese.While these factional perspectives diverge, they end up in the same place: continued pressure on China. While some productive â€œart of the dealâ€? outcome might be Trumpâ€™s preference, itâ€™s difficult to see how that can happen.Beijing will also be a key target with the upcoming tightening of sanctions on a number of countries continuing to do business with Iran. This will mean not just China but also Turkey and possibly India. (India is a special case because of Washington policymakersâ€™ efforts to woo New Delhi as the linchpin of the so-called â€œIndo-Pacific Quadâ€? intended to contain China.) But the most important targets will be countries of the European Union. Much is being made of a so-called â€œclearing house,â€? or Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for conducting business with Iran to avoid the SWIFT system and US sanctions.The SPV concept is supported by the European Union, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, as well as China and Russia. Simply the suggestion of the SPV mechanism has infuriated Washington, because it not only signals a possible shift by Europe from Washingtonâ€™s â€œTransatlanticâ€? yoke, it means betting their economic future on cooperation with Russia and China. (It should also be kept in mind that the US Treasury Department can simply sanction the SPV clearing house itself, applying secondary sanctions to any European companies that interact with it.)One of the telltale clues that a country is rising up Washingtonâ€™s enemies list is when its leader is personally demonized as dictator, a thug, and ultimately Hitler. Russiaâ€™s Vladimir Putin has long received this treatment. While Chinaâ€™s Xi Jinping, until recently, has received respectful treatment, that is shifting into familiar, ugly territory. Xi is now a 'dictator' and 'the worst totalitarian since Mao'. Worse is no doubt to come.Read moreIn his recent Valdai forum speech Putin pronounced the end of the US â€œmonopoly from a unipolar world,â€? saying that â€œluckily, this monopoly is disappearing. Itâ€™s almost done.â€? Few people of any standing in Washington would agree with him.Whatever the view from Sochi, in Washington all evidence still points to a dogged and dangerous insistence that the course laid down in the 1996 Foreign Affairs article by neoconservative ideologists William Kristol and Robert Kagan, misleadingly titled â€œToward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy,â€? in which they called for the US to establish and maintain indefinitely â€œbenevolent global hegemonyâ€? â€“ American world domination â€“ remains the guiding vision, specifically over the objections of Russia and China.â€˜The aspiration to benevolent hegemony might strike some as either hubristic or morally suspect. But a hegemon is nothing more or less than a leader with preponderant influence and authority over all others in its domain. That is America's position in the world today. The leaders of Russia and China understand this. At their April summit meeting, Boris Yeltsin and Jiang Zemin joined in denouncing 'hegemonism' in the post-Cold War world. They meant this as a complaint about the United States. It should be taken as a compliment and a guide to action.â€™As scrutinized by this writer the following year, the 1996 Foreign Affairs manifesto described virtually all of the elements that have guided US foreign policy during the ensuing years, in Democratic and Republican administrations alike. What has changed since then? Moscow and Beijing are still not partners to be engaged, they are simply obstacles to be overcome. The fact that Russia and China are more powerful than they were two decades ago just spurs greater US efforts to thwart them.Despite Trumpâ€™s railing against the failures of his predecessors during the 2016 campaign, nothing in the behavior of his administration indicates any departure from the pattern set before he took office. Indeed, there is reason to believe that inertial pattern has been consciously imported into the administrationâ€™s thinking, notably by National Security Advisor John Bolton, former director of the Project for a New American Century, founded by Kristol and Kagan in 1997, the year after their article appeared.Viewed through this lens, while Russia may be the immediate hindrance, especially in Syria and Ukraine, Chinaâ€™s turn is approaching, perhaps faster than anyone anticipated. Despite a few voices of reason, a new Cold War in the east may be unavoidable. Whatever Trumpâ€™s personal opinion might happen to be seems not to matter one way or the other.Like this story?

"With bright minds gathering at the European House-Ambrosetti forum on the banks of Lake Como in Italy, Europe is facing a number of pressing issues: the looming trade war with the US, the refugee crisis, and EU reform. Can the current system face up to today's challenges? The former prime minister of Italy, Enrico Letta, shared his perspective.Follow @SophieCo_RTSophie Shevardnadze: Enrico Letta, thanks for being with us today. Itâ€™s great to have you as our guest. Lots to talk about since so many changes are taking place in Europe. So, Europeâ€™s lucrative transatlantic trade may be in jeopardy, and Trump right now is saying â€œyou know what, the U.S. will outlast Europe in this trade stand-off and weâ€™re going to negotiate hard to make peace on American terms.â€? Whatâ€™s going to happen? Will Europe just have to capitulate, what does this mean?Enrico Letta: I think, Trump is becoming the best ally of the more united European Union. Trump is pushing Europeans to understand that we have to be together because the only way to be together means reacting to these threats. I think, the trade threats of Trump is a mortal threat for Europe. Itâ€™s a mortal threat because the model of the European economy is based on export, on producing more than we consume. And that is crucial for the future of the European Union. If we have the world of protectionism, if weâ€™re obliged to produce only for the internal consumption this will be the end of the European economic model. This is why trade is becoming the big gap between the European Union and the U.S.SS: Trump is also threatening to pull America out of the WTO if everything doesnâ€™t go the American way. What would that mean for Europe and for the organisation?EL: I think, for WTO it would be a mortal threat too, but at the same time I donâ€™t think itâ€™s possible to have trade at multilateral level without a multilateral organisation. We canâ€™t have only bilateral agreements between countries. We need to have an international multilateral organisation. WTO was this organisation, it worked during some period of our history, even recent history. I think, Trump attacked multilateralism and Europe at the same time. I think this double attack is a big signal for us - we have to react. We were always an ally of the U.S., and weâ€™re still an ally of the U.S. Trump is another thing, Trump is really a threat for us.SS: Letâ€™s talk in more details in terms of what the European reaction should be. Because Trump is threatening to slap import taxes on 200 billion dollars worth of Chinese goods, he then said that â€œThe European Union is almost as bad as China, only smallerâ€?. What do you make of it? What does this mean? And should Europe be preparing for import taxes from Washington as well?EL: I think, reactions can be considered in this term as well. But at the end of the day Trumpâ€™s protectionism is affecting Europe more today than China. The decisions Trump took until now were first the decision against friends, allies. Friends and allies like the European Union or like Canada or Mexico donâ€™t have any customs or protectionism with the U.S. We were really in a very good relationship in terms of trade. China already has many barriers with the U.S. So the decisions of Trump today are affecting more the European Union, Canada and Mexico than China. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re so angry with him and thatâ€™s why our reaction is in terms of counter-reactions to the U.S. but also turning to the East.SS: What are the other things Europe could do? Slapping tariffs in retaliation to a hostile action is maybe a strong thing to do, but that will not end the trade war itself. Is there anything else other than new trade taxes that the EU can do and turning to the East?EL: We will hope the Democrats can defeat Trump in the next election.SS: Thatâ€™s a very big â€œifâ€? because no one even thought he would be elected for the first timeâ€¦EL: Right. At the end of the day, I think, Trump is doing what he said in the electoral campaign. Iâ€™m not surprised by the direction he took. The point is that that direction is a wrong one - the direction of saying â€œAmerica Firstâ€? or â€œAmericaâ€™s Industry Firstâ€? is the demonstration that we can start trade wars. Trade wars among Western countries, among WTO countries, among West and East are the way to waste opportunities, to destroy jobs, to destroy the recovery in our part of the world. This is why retaliation and reaction and the global act from the European Union, this is why I mentioned the Eastern countries, I can mention also, for instance, Mexico. We have to have a new deal with Mexico because this is a demonstration that we want to be positive and proactive towards the North America. But we canâ€™t accept this attitude of Mr. Trump.SS: Ok, so you said in the beginning of the interview that whatever is happening is a mortal threat to Europe. But Iâ€™ve also heard you saying in an interview that Trumpâ€™s hostile attitude towards Europe is actually going to help Europe to grow up. Itâ€™s funny because itâ€™s what we, Russians, say about the sanctions - the sanctions will help us grow up. But are you, guys, (by â€œyouâ€? I mean â€œthe Europeansâ€?) ready to defy America on serious issues like Iran sanctions, for instance?EL: I think, itâ€™s really unacceptable what happened to Iran. So I think we really need to think how to avoid the bad consequences of Trumpâ€™s decisions on Iran. It depends on the next elections. It depends whether Trump will be re-elected or not. One scenario is Trumpâ€™s sort of parenthesis is one term and then is a sort of nightmare that can end up and we can start again with this strong alliance and strong working together between U.S. and Europe. If Trump gets re-elected in 2020, that is profoundly different. This is why the next months will be important to follow this evolution.SS: Ok, so letâ€™s talk a little bit about Italyâ€™s and Europeâ€™s relations with Russia. Europe and Russia have separate relations, they are much more tied historically and economically than Russia and America. Russia and America is more strategic partnership more than anything else. Practically all the political forces in Italy that Iâ€™ve come across are for close cooperation with Moscow. I donâ€™t know any Italian politician - whether itâ€™s conservative or democratic or the alternative parties - that would say â€œwe need to make war with Russiaâ€?. All of them say â€œwe need to co-operate with Moscow, thatâ€™s the only wayâ€?. But when it comes to lifting the sanctions the only thing Italy can do is just vote against the automatic extension of sanctions. Why, do you think, Rome canâ€™t be stronger in saying â€œmaybe we should get rid of the sanctions if we understand that this doesnâ€™t benefit Italy politically or economicallyâ€??EL: Italy is the country that, as you know, with the best relationship with Russia in economic and political terms. So it is clear, itâ€™s not a hidden agenda for Italy to overcome this situation. But at the same time weâ€™re within the European Union, and within the European Union thereâ€™s a mixed feeling and a wider and complex scenario towards this topic. I think, itâ€™s necessary to work all together to overcome this situation. Itâ€™s in the interest of all Europe, itâ€™s in the interest of Italy. I think, at the end of the day, itâ€™s in the interest of Russia too. Itâ€™s necessary to work all together to have an evolution. You mentioned the U.S. and Europe - itâ€™s clear that thereâ€™s a different interest. The different interest is because geopolitics is formed by two words: geography and politics. As for geography Europe and Russia are neighbours. We have to co-exist, we have to work together, we have to co-operate. This is not the case for the U.S. So this is why the key point for us that the consideration in the next future a path, a way, a roadmap on how to overcome sanctions is in our interest, is in the interest of all the European Union. But I think itâ€™s in the interest of Russia too. This is why we hope that Russiaâ€¦SS: Itâ€™s for sure, trust me, sanctions arenâ€™t helping us, that I can tell you. I want to get your personal view on this, what is this about? Macron comes to Russia, or Chancellor Merkel comes to Russia, and everytime they speak itâ€™s about bridging the gaps, not about the gaps. They talk about the importance of being together and moving forward together, but the minute theyâ€™re home facing their audiences, itâ€™s all about super-anti-Russian rhetoric. Is this for the audiences, is this for the voters? Or what is this thing - â€œonce weâ€™re in Russia talking to Putin we say one thing and as soon as we come back home we need to pursue the usual rhetoric or else we will be seen as what?â€?EL: Because itâ€™s necessary to understand that this diplomatic situation needs a diplomatic pride and a very wise approach meaning that maybe we need to separate, we have to co-operate on many things and we have to freeze a little bit the problems weâ€™re having. Without raising this problems as incontournable, as the French say, questions, co-operating on other issues and knowing that the European Union is composed by 28 countries today. And we have to respect that some of them have a different approach than weâ€™re having as Italians. And if I may say, itâ€™s the demonstration of the fact that on foreign policy the European Union has to make steps towards the unification of the position. And maybe we need to have an institutional framework to make decisions by majority, without finding always the consensus rule. But you know, itâ€™s an internal problem of the European Union because the difference is that Russia is one country with one president and one parliament, the European Union means 28 countries with one parliament plus 28 national parliaments, one commision. So thereâ€™s a clear and balanced institutional situation. I think, itâ€™s necessary for Russia to know this difference. Russia knows it very well, President Putin knows Europe very well and he knows the complexity of the European institutional architecture. And this difference is a big difference.SS: Mr. Letta, letâ€™s talk about the differences within Europe because youâ€™re probably one of the best speakers to speak for the European Union as a whole. The refugee crisis which is hitting the European Union is really hard right now. Italy and Hungary are creating a united front against migration. They seek support of Austria and the Visegrad Group, and they saying that the 2019 European Parliament election is going to become a referendum on a â€œEurope without bordersâ€? that Emmanuel Macron has proposed against â€œEurope that protects itselfâ€?. This division - can this be something fatal for Europe?EL: I think, youâ€™re right. The European elections next year will probably be the most important European elections ever. In the European history the European Parliament elections have always been the elections in which - it seems a joke, but itâ€™s reality - Europe was not the matter, not the core of the discussion. Each country was using the European elections to discuss domestic affairs, to try to check the popularity of the government and so on and so forth. It is the first time the European elections will change in any way the European path because, you know, for twenty years until now the European Parliament was formed around two big political pillars: centre-left and centre-right. All the political decisions even on Russia sanctions or trade issues are an outcome of an agreement between these two political families. So, the European Parliament is an easy landscape you need an agreement between the two groups and thatâ€™s it. That will change next year. Next year you will have fragmentation. Probably, it will be necessary to have an agreement between four groups to have a majority, that means a completely different decision-making process on the European level. I think, next year at this very period weâ€™ll say â€œoh, the old good times of 2016 or 2017â€? because the European Parliament will be completely different, and in this European Parliament the other main point will be whether the populist parties are running together in a united group or they are divided, because, of course, if they are united and if they get 20, 25 or 30% of the votes that will change the European life a lot. Thatâ€™s why the next year will be a turning point in the European political life. You mentioned migration. You know, migration is the typical point where the intergovernmental rule doesnâ€™t work. If you have 28 heads of state and governments meeting at the table and the topic is how many migrants you take in, it doesnâ€™t work. The answer will always be â€œzeroâ€?. I, as Prime Minister of my country, want no migrants, I want zero. But if you have refugees coming you need to have a supranational organisation like the European Commission taking the responsibility to say: â€œThese are Syrian refugees, we need to welcome them and so we have to redistribute them between the member statesâ€?. Itâ€™s not the goodwill of one country saying â€œI can take one thousand or one hundredâ€?. Itâ€™s a different way. With the intergovernmental rule it will be impossible to solve the migrant problem in Europe.SS: So the way it looks right now - I donâ€™t know what going to be in years to come - but right now your new government doesnâ€™t want migrants in Italy and is even threatening not to pay its share to the EU budget over the migration issueâ€¦EL: Yes, but you know, this agreement between Italy and Hungary is a contradiction. Italy is the country of first entry in the European Union because itâ€™s a Mediterranean country like Greece. So itâ€™s almost impossible to block any arrival because of the coastal geography of Italy. So the first need of Italy is to have the solidarity of the rest of the European Union. When we have refugees arriving we need other countries to show solidarity towards us. Orban and Hungary are giving the least of solidarity. They donâ€™t want to have any migrants. So the big contradiction is that Italy needs exactly the opposite. Italy needs a European situation in whichâ€¦ You know, we had a crisis in 2015, it was a very difficult crisis. But if you have 500 thousand refugees arriving, and if you are a continent of 500 million people, if you spread all these migrants in all the continent, you can at the end of the day welcome them, you can live with this problem. But if you welcome them only in one country - Italy or Germany - the problem is absolutely inconceivable and unsolvable. This is why only a European solution can give some answers to these migrant flows. Of course, we have to control our external borders. Iâ€™m not for open doors of Europe to all migrants. Itâ€™s not manageable. But for refugees coming from wars that the Westâ€¦ You know, Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria - these three countries are countries of origin for half of refugees during this crisis. These are the three countries where the big mistakes of the West - the U.S. first of all - were made. So itâ€™s necessary to give an answer thatâ€™s a unified answer.SS: So what are the chances of Emmanuel Macronâ€™s proposed EU reform to be implemented, to come to life with so many obstacles on its way? You need the German backing, you need Chancellor Merkel to back you, her position at home is weakened, and Germans are very wary anything pan-European, because they hear that and they automatically think they need to pay for everything especially the poorer countries. So she will have to back the reform, back you and maybe weaken her position at home. Then the Germans also say that for this reform to undergo all parliaments need to agree which is an impossible thing to do. What are his chances of this reform coming to life? How realistic is this? And do you still believe that Emmanuel Macron is the big unifier?EL: Among many bad news in the European Union during the last period there was one good news - the agreement between France and Germany on some reforms of the Euro area. They had this agreement in the end of June in Meseberg. I think, Italy has all the interest to support and to have the possibility to implement part of this agreement. Itâ€™s an agreement on how to create a eurobudget. The eurobudget needs to create an insurance against unemployment, and Italy needs social measures to complete the financial architecture of the European Union. The European Union is the financial architecture with the lack of a social pillar. So what I would like to see is my government pushing for the reform in that direction, not for less Euro, because we have the Euro, the Euro is there. And we have to complete the architecture. So what Germans and French agreed in Meseberg was the first step thatâ€™s interesting. Itâ€™s in our own interest as Italians. There are many difficulties, Iâ€™m not sure that all these reforms can be approved because of the differences, and also because of the fact that the main problem of the next few months will be Brexit. If you ask me what is the biggest worry we have today itâ€™s not all we talked about, itâ€™s Brexit. Weâ€™re going towards Brexit - towards the cliff edge as we say, towards the disaster. Thereâ€™s no plan A, no plan B and even no plan C. Thereâ€™s just approaching March 29th with the idea that the day after will be a disaster. This disaster will create big financial instability, and we will suffer a lot. This is why Iâ€™m really worried about Brexit. This is why you have to add Brexit to all what I said about the next yearâ€™s elections. The elections will be in May, Brexit will be end of March. We will have, I fear, a very sad spring. We will have to think about the future of Europe thinking that we will have to overcome all these difficulties, and the next year will be a very complicated year.SS: Hopefully, youâ€™ll overcome all the difficulties. All the best of luck to you. Thank you very much for this interview.EL: Thank you very much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trump is planning on announcing his new tariffs on China as early as Thursday.'Tomorrow the president will announce the actions he has decided to take based on USTRâ€™s 301 investigation into Chinaâ€™s state-led, market-distorting efforts to force, pressure, and steal U.S. technologies and intellectual property,' a Trump official explained on Wednesday, according to Reuters.Although the size and scope of the tariffs remains unclear, it is expected that they will go after China's high-technology sector as well as its companies' investments in the United States. One justification for imposing the new tariffs was found in the results of an investigation by the United States under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. Investigators found that China had stolen from and coerced American companies to disclose their intellectual property, as well as bought information about technology from American companies using government funds.The Trump administration has also accused China of currency manipulation in order to facilitate sales of its exports, according to CNBC. The president himself has also made it clear that he dislikes China's $375 billion goods trade surplus with the United States, which he has characterized as unfair and as taking advantage of America. If Trump's tariff announcement winds up impacting $60 billion worth of Chinese exports, as some experts predict, that will account for more than 10 percent of the goods China exported to the United States in 2017.'China will certainly take all necessary measures to resolutely defend its legitimate rights and interests,' the Ministry of Commerce declared in a statement on Thursday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trump is pushing for Congress to go easy on a Chinese telecommunications company that may pose a national security threat to the United States.Trump's plan to pressure Republican congressmen on Wednesday came after a defense bill was passed in the Senate on Monday that restored economic sanctions on ZTE Corp., according to Bloomberg. The measure, which was passed by a margin of 85 votes to 10 votes, caused a 27 percent decline in ZTE's stock on the Hong Kong exchange. It was supported by a bipartisan coalition, with many Republicans sharing the view of their Democratic colleagues that ZTE poses a national security threat to the United States and that Trump was in error for opposing sanctions against it.The Senate's defense bill will ultimately need to be reconciled with a similar measure passed by the House of Representatives in May, albeit one that did not contain the same sanctions restoration provisions. This will provide Trump with an opportunity to exert pressure on legislators to remove or weaken the sanctions in the bill that is ultimately passed by both houses of Congress.Trump's determination to protect ZTE is seemingly at odds with his otherwise tough stance on trade matters, particularly involving China. As Reuters reported on Monday:Trump threatened on Monday to hit $200 billion of Chinese imports with 10 percent tariffs if Beijing retaliated against his previous targeting of $50 billion in imports, aimed at pressuring China to stop stealing U.S. intellectual property. He also threatened tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese products should Beijing hit back again, bringing to $450 billion the potential amount of Chinese exports that could be targeted. That sum approaches the roughly $500 billion in total annual Chinese exports to the United States.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On May 31, when President Donald Trump levied tariffs on steels and aluminum imports from the European Union, Mexico and Canada, most observers were less surprised by his actions than by his justifications for the move. Under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Trump asserted that he was issuing the tariffs on national security grounds â€“ the first usage of this power since 1983. What does this move say about the Trump administrationâ€™s view of trade strategy? Does the president seriously view international trade as a security threat to the United States?President Trump is waging war on free trade like no other American president has done in recent memory. As the 2016 campaign revealed, the president views the trade practices of key international commercial partners as a threat to national security and is levying tariffs on their exports in response. Such a move fittingly reflects Trumpâ€™s zero-sum understanding of international politics, but also risks altering the manner in which the United States conducts international trade, by making trade a security priority â€“ a shift that could have significant consequences for the future of U.S. alliances and the American economy moving forward.The term national security is inherently ambiguous and, as a result, no statutory definition exists in the United States, affording the president a significant degree of latitude in defining what constitutes a threat to the nationâ€™s security. Since World War II, the principle of open international trade has been a key feature of American foreign policy â€“ a vehicle through which the United States could enhance bilateral and multi-lateral relations through cooperation and mutual interests and, as a result, create an international system of like-minded, trade-friendly states â€“ but has not been seen as a threat.This framework has laid and continues to lay the foundation for an international order that strengthens national and international security through the cultivation of cooperative relationships that draw states closer economically, culturally and defensively. Trumpâ€™s approach to international trade, rather, is a departure from this perspective, and has explicitly identified trade as a â€œthreatâ€? to national security, rather than a medium for advancing security interests through positive-sum commercial relationships.In the mid-1990s, political scientist Ole WÃ¦ver and his colleagues at the Copenhagen Peace Research Institute laid out a new theory of security that sought to challenge classical security studies thinking. They coined it â€œsecuritization theory.â€? They argued that the concept of â€œnational securityâ€? is simply the construct of â€œsecuritizing actorsâ€? â€“ those in positions of authority on security issues â€“ who could shift a national security agenda and legitimize it through rhetoric and a captive intended audience. In essence, this theory is a version of hyper-politicization in the form of national security planning and agenda-setting. Securitization is not necessarily good or bad, but rather the exercising of power by influential actors to transform national security policy to their liking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"China and the United States are poles apart when it comes to resolving their current trade dispute. Recognition in the markets that the US-China trade war could drag on for years will force a re-evaluation of how the changed circumstances will affect prices across asset classes. That re-evaluation is arguably already starting.President Donald Trump asserts strongly that his interest is in securing â€œfairâ€? trade deals, but his words seem to indicate that he is a mercantilist who believes that running trade deficits, by definition, weakens the US.China willing to talk trade but not with American â€˜knife at its neckâ€™â€œWe are fixing one-sided trade deals that have stolen American jobs and drained American wealth, just taken away our wealth. Itâ€™s like candy from a baby, they took our money, they took our jobs. They took everything. They took our dignity,â€? Trump said on Friday at a rally in Missouri.More specifically, â€œChina last year took US$500 billion from our country â€“ 500 billion, not million, 500 billion.â€? He added: â€œWe have rebuilt China. We have given them such wealth.â€?Yet, as Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told the World Economic Forum in Tianjin last week, China is aware that it remains a developing country, and it still ranks at the â€œlower end of the worldâ€? in terms of per capita GDP.Watch: Escalating trade war makes European firms nervousChina vs Trump: how the trade war highlights a culture clashAt its heart, though, this trade war is surely just one aspect of a much deeper problem. Although the emergence of China as an inexpensive manufacturing base has mightily benefited US consumers and many US companies, Washington has become increasingly wary about what Chinaâ€™s rise implies for Americaâ€™s global influence. The possibility that Chinaâ€™s economy could grow in size to exceed that of the US is a case in point.As Graham Allison, of the Harvard Kennedy School, wrote last year in Foreign Policy magazine, one of the lessons of the cold war was that â€œdomestic performance is decisiveâ€?.â€œHad the Soviet economy overtaken that of the US by the 1980s, as some economists predicted, Moscow could have consolidated a position of hegemony. Instead, free markets and free societies won out,â€? Allison wrote. The â€œvital questionâ€? for the US-China rivalry today is whether President Xi Jinpingâ€™s â€œLeninist-Mandarin authoritarian government and economy proves superior to American capitalism and democracyâ€?.A combination of that kind of strategic unease and Trumpâ€™s mercantilist approach does no leave much room for a new trade bilateral relationship to be cemented any time soon.Watch: Chinese people hope for a swift end to the trade warWhen will Trump wake up to the folly of his unwinnable trade war?But what might that mean for markets? Premier Liâ€™s speech at the World Economic Forum might provide a few pointers. For the currency markets, it would appear that whatever path China chooses, it isnâ€™t minded to take the route of currency devaluation in an attempt to shore up its export competitiveness. â€œChina will not engage in competitive devaluation,â€? Li said.Li also explained how China â€œwill more proactively leverage on fiscal policyâ€? in boosting domestic demand and restructuring, by further cutting taxes and fees.â€œGiven that consumption has now become the primary driver of Chinaâ€™s economic growth, we need to increase household incomes through multiple channels to expand the spending power of our consumers,â€? Li said, adding that the new personal income tax law, to be implemented soon, would notably reduce tax burdens on individuals.These are domestic reflationary measures that will, even if they were long in the planning, be a timely policy offset to the deterioration in China-US trade relations.Trumpâ€™s trade war is a blessing in disguise for Chinese leadersGiven the size of Chinaâ€™s economy, US bank Morgan Stanley, in an analysis last week, even feels such measures will have a global reflationary impact. â€œChina has turned from a capital exporter into a funds importer as domestic financial institutions (which used to fund expansionary programmes) have sharply reduced their lending,â€? it said. â€œAs a result, Chinaâ€™s reflation programme may have a bigger impact on the global cost of capital than in the past, explaining higher [developed market] bond yields.â€?Additional, if marginal, upward pressure on US yields could also materialise if markets take the view that there should be some paring back of Chinese demand for US government paper related to the deterioration in China-US trade relations.The prospect of Chinese domestic reflation might also be felt in the commodity space. The price of copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange notably rose above 50,000 yuan (US$7,300) on Friday for the first time in six weeks.Thereâ€™s no quick fix to be had in the China-US trade war.

"With no sign of a let-up in the trade war with the United States, Chinaâ€™s top leaders are looking inward for new growth drivers in a move that could affect the nationâ€™s economic trajectory in the years ahead.While Beijing is keen to attract foreign investors by trumpeting its efforts at â€œopening upâ€?, it is also preparing for the possibility that growing international hostility might make it tougher to sell products to and acquire advanced technology from the US and other wealthy nations.In a white paper issued late last month, China said it planned to revitalise its domestic market by making its rust belt and vast countryside more self-sufficient.In his first public statement on what China should do to cope with growing hostility in the outside world, Chinese President Xi Jinping said last week that rising unilateralism and protectionism was forcing China to become more self-reliant, and â€œitâ€™s not a bad thingâ€?.Xi made the assessment during a visit to a state-owned factory in the rust-belt region of northeast China, which borders Russia and was once a base of the planned economy but is now the sick man of the economy.During his visit, Xi said the government would continue to back state-owned enterprises (SOE) to make them â€œbigger and strongerâ€?, despite complaints from Washington and Brussels that they distort market competition.According to Chinese government statements, academics and analysts, the message that China must â€œeventually rely on itselfâ€? suggests the emergence of a more inward-looking strategy, which in turn is a product of the perception that the US is trying to thwart Chinaâ€™s rise and that the trade war is just an element of that.Kong Dan, a â€œprincelingâ€? in the ruling Communist Party and former chairman of state-owned conglomerate Citic Group, said last month that the trade dispute between China and the US was â€œan argument about trade on the surfaceâ€? but ultimately about â€œpathsâ€?, as in Washingtonâ€™s market-led liberal democracy and Beijingâ€™s state-led model.â€œFor them [the US], if they donâ€™t contain us now, our development will set to threaten them,â€? he said in a speech at an academic conference. â€œSo they are attacking our path â€“ our model of development is seen as a serious threat to them.â€?Kong, who has close links to the leadership, said China had to develop a new mechanism to mobilise the countryâ€™s resources to cope with the new challenges.Ding Yifan, a senior researcher at Tsinghua Universityâ€™s National Strategy Institute, said China had no option but to seek â€œself-relianceâ€? if the US was unwilling to maintain the status quo on trade and economic interactions.Chinaâ€™s industrial value chain system, namely its ability to make everything â€œfrom a nail to a rocketâ€?, would help it to weather the confrontation, he said.Beijing made some preparations for the headwinds from the trade war in July when it told local governments to speed up infrastructure investment. But as the dispute has escalated, so Chinaâ€™s tactical responses have been accompanied by strategic blueprints.Days after the US imposed tariffs on US$200 billion worth of goods it imports from China, Beijing issued a plan to improve its rural economy in the 2018-22 period. It covered everything from garbage processing to â€œEngelâ€™s coefficientâ€? â€“ the ratio of spending on food in overall income.This rural development blueprint came just days after another state plan for â€œstimulating Chinese consumer spending potentialâ€?, aimed specifically at spending on tourism, health care and education. In one example, the National Development and Reform Commission is urging local authorities to cut admission fees at popular attractions to help boost domestic tourism.While Xi was touring the countryâ€™s northeast, Premier Li Keqiang was visiting the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, the cradle the countryâ€™s private economy, where he pledged equal government support for the private sector.According to official reports, Li told local governments to cut red tape and corporate burdens on private firms, and instructed banks not to favour state firms in lending.At a seminar with businesspeople in Taizhou, where the private economy has been thriving since the 1980s, Li vowed to continue economic restructuring and quicken the pace of building a â€œmarket and law-based international business environmentâ€?.Julian Evans-Pritchard, a senior economist for Capital Economics in Singapore, said the whole of the developed world was wary of Chinaâ€™s ambitions due to factors such as its â€œMade in China 2025â€? strategy for industrial upgrading, its â€œBelt and Road Initiativeâ€? to boost international trade and infrastructure links, and its traditional growth model.â€œThey [the Chinese authorities] are particularly concerned that the dispute with the US could be broadened towards the rest of the developed world,â€? he said. â€œIt is noticeable that the US, the European Union, Japan and South Korea in some respects have taken a joint stand on issues like intellectual property.â€œThe Chinese leadership are going to be more wary of the West as a result of recent experiences.â€?As a result, Beijing might have to rely more on its home market and domestic capabilities, he said.Some observers have said exports are no longer a deciding factor for Chinaâ€™s economic growth.Exports accounted for just 18 per cent of gross domestic product in the first half of 2018, of which about a fifth went to the United States.Former central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan and other economists said the trade war would have only a marginal impact on Chinaâ€™s GDP.According to official figures, Chinaâ€™s economy grew by 6.7 per cent in the second quarter, while exports in August grew 9.8 per cent from the same month of 2017. The official purchasing managersâ€™ also pointed to expansion.However, there are also signs of trouble in Chinaâ€™s US$12 trillion economy. Consumer spending growth has slowed to its lowest level in 15 years and other indicators suggest there are signs of weakness in Chinaâ€™s manufacturing base of Guangdong.Zhou Hao, a senior economist with Commerzbank, said there was no concrete evidence to show the trade war had had a substantial impact on Chinaâ€™s economy, but it had brought huge uncertainty and dampened domestic sentiment.Hu Xingdou, a Beijing-based economist, said Chinaâ€™s plan to increase self-reliance did not mean the country would reverse its economic reforms or opening up.â€œThe trend of economic reforms is irresistible and the opened door must not be shut,â€? he said. â€œOtherwise, it would lead to economic disaster and an all round retreat.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"China must make substantial changes to its economic policies or it will face disengagement with its largest trading partners, American former officials and economists have warned in Beijing.The suggestion that China could be left isolated in global trade came days after US Vice-President Mike Pence made a speech adding to concerns that an economic cold war was looming between the worldâ€™s two largest economies.Mondayâ€™s visit by American scholars in Beijing â€“ at a time of shrinking direct dialogue between academics of the two countries â€“ came on the same day US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo paid a brief visit to Beijing marked by frosty talks. After his discussions, Pompeo said the two sides were stuck in â€œfundamental disagreementâ€? over a range of issues, from bilateral trade to Chinaâ€™s domestic and foreign policies.The US scholars â€“ attending a seminar hosted by Peking Universityâ€™s national school of development and the Heritage Foundation, a conservative public policy think tank in Washington â€“ offered a stark assessment at the forum with Chinese academic counterparts including Justin Yifu Lin, the former chief economist of the World Bank who advises Chinaâ€™s top leadership, and Huang Yiping, an adviser to Chinaâ€™s central bank.US Vice-President Mike Pence steps up attacks on China by backing Donald Trumpâ€™s claim itâ€™s trying to sabotage electionsDerek Scissors, a resident scholar of the American Enterprise Institute, another Washington-based conservative think tank, said that confrontations over alleged theft of American companiesâ€™ intellectual property and state protection of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) would probably worsen if China sticks to its existing industrial policies.â€œWe have seen no movement from the Chinese side to allow greater foreign competition with central SOEs,â€? he said. â€œIn fact, we see consolidation of central SOEs to make them less vulnerable to competition.â€?Scissors warned that trade disengagement from the US and other partners could result, and may hurt Chinaâ€™s tradeâ€™s sectors.â€œWe are moving towards a relationship where China and the United States will both block investment in certain sectors,â€? he said.â€œIn two weeks, the US Treasury is likely to call China a currency manipulator.â€?Scissors did not explain why he was making such a forecast.He added that US President Donald Trump did not have a long-term approach to contain China and was â€œimpatientâ€?.â€œA deal could occur, but will not persist,â€? Scissors said.Chinaâ€™s model of state-sponsored â€œinnovationâ€? was fundamentally different from that of the US, he added.US Secretary Pompeoâ€™s China visit marked by frosty talks and â€˜fundamental disagreementâ€™â€œThe US government did not have tech policy targets, industrial funds and enterprises which cannot fail,â€? he said. Instead, â€œthe most competitive, innovative and productive firms should win, not those backed by governmentâ€?.Edwin Feulner, a founder of the Heritage Foundation, said that many Americans blamed China for empty factories, lost jobs and ghost towns in the US, and often linked Chinaâ€™s growth to stolen technologies, cyberattacks and other negative factors.â€œItâ€™s no longer possible to do business as usual with Washington,â€? he said. â€œI know Trump doesnâ€™t like failure. [He] is a tough negotiator.â€?There will be a long list of economic issues that must be addressed by both countries, including intellectual property rights, and Communist Party cells in joint ventures, subsidies of SOEs and state-invested businesses, Feulner said.Top US, China trade negotiators unlikely to meet during IMF/World Bank parleys, US official saysPhillip Swagel, a professor of the University of Maryland, who assisted Henry Paulson when Paulson was US Treasury Secretary during the 2008 global financial crisis, said that American businesses negatively affected by Chinaâ€™s trade practices were often the least flexible parts of the US economy, and that US policymakers had to find ways to address their woes.â€œEven after so many political battles in our country, both Democrats and Republicans share the view that things must change in the China-US relationship and an important aspect of the change must come from China,â€? said Swagel.Such a view is growing among previously China-friendly US businesses.China vows to end forced tech transfers in manufacturing sectorâ€œOver the last several years, those natural friends of China were frustrated by Chinese actions,â€? Swagel said, referring to forced technology transfer for businesses operating in China; the countryâ€™s business licence requirement; biased enforcement of antitrust rules; US accusations of Chinese cyberattacks; and Chinaâ€™s data protection practices, including information collection and a crackdown on domestic use of virtual private networks.James Dorn, vice-president of the Washington conservative think tank Cato Institute, said at the same forum that China should keep its promises and allow a free flow of information and ideas to win back trust.â€œIf the [Chinese] leadership actually sticks to what they are saying, like on free trade, and makes concrete steps in that direction, the American public would see that, and if they actually did something it would be positive,â€? he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chinese investment in Asean countries is set to more than triple to US$500 billion by 2035, with the US-China trade war likely to provide a catalyst for the spike, according to a regional think tank.The claim was made in a report published on Thursday by the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO), a regional macroeconomic surveillance unit based in Singapore that represents the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, plus China, Japan and South Korea.While the trade conflict between Washington and Beijing could cause some short-term disruption to supply chains and production networks, in the longer term it may also accelerate investment between China and Asean, said Chaipat Poonpatpibul, AMROâ€™s principal economist.The report estimated that China has invested US$150 billion in Asean countries in 2018, but said that figure could soar by more than 230 per cent by 2035. Investment in the other direction was forecast to rise by a similar proportion, to US$200 billion in 2035 from an estimated US$60 billion this year, it said.The trade war has already led to South Koreaâ€™s LG and Samsung Electronics shifting part of their manufacturing from China to Vietnam to avoid the US tariffs on Chinese imports. But while that might benefit Vietnam in the short term, its own exports may be hit if Washington extends its punitive measures to Chinese producers operating there.â€œIn the long term, we see this as a catalyst for further trade and investment integration [between China and Asean], as some industries may move to Asean and that will create further investment and trade opportunities between the two sides,â€? Poonpatpibul said.Beijing has said Asean is a key investment destination for China. As of the end of last year, there were more than 4,000 Chinese companies in the region, employing about 300,000 locals.Some of Chinaâ€™s investments come under the umbrella of Beijingâ€™s â€œBelt and Road Initiativeâ€?, although Xi Jinpingâ€™s pet infrastructure development project is not without its problems. After returning to office in May, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad halted work on a US$20 billion rail link and two natural gas pipeline projects funded by Chinese investors.AMRO, which also works as an advisory body for regional governments, said it expects China to account for 22 per cent of Aseanâ€™s trade by 2035, up from 17 per cent this year. At the same time, Asean is forecast to account for 18 per cent of Chinaâ€™s total trade, from 11 per cent in 2018.Meanwhile, the number of Chinese tourists visiting Asean countries is expected to double to 72 million by 2035, the report said.Despite the mostly positive outlook, the AMRO report said the current slowdown in the worldâ€™s second-largest economy could have a detrimental impact on its neighbours.â€œOne of the risks is the external environment,â€? said Hoe Ee Khor, its chief economist. â€œIf countries become more protectionist, it will slow down the speed of integration.â€?Asean comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The trade war between China and the United States has made some Chinese consumers think negatively about America. Yet US luxury brands in China, from Ralph Lauren to Tiffany, are in a position of strength â€“ they just need to know how to leverage it.So says Jerry Clode, director of Smart, the research arm of Shanghai-based digital and social media agency Resonance, who made that argument last month in a presentation to the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. He emphasised just how much cultural weight mass-produced US luxury (â€œmasstigeâ€?) brands have in China.â€œIn China, American brands have been incredibly successful in owning category and new behaviours,â€? Clode told the South China Morning Post. â€œStarbucks has created coffee culture, Disney is the exemplar family destination, Apple still dominates premium consumer technology and Tesla has captured the imagination of Chinaâ€™s future-focused middle class.â€œAs local consumers increasingly use fashion and luxury to express their lifestyle and identity, American brands have a profound head start on other nationalities in terms of precedent and aspiration,â€? he said.Accessibility and aspiration arenâ€™t working out as well for some â€œmasstigeâ€? brands in their home market. Brands such as Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren are not as highly rated by American consumers as they once were.Once hailed as ideal representations of the luxury lifestyle to which consumers should aspire, many of these brands have lost value, owing to the ubiquity of their clothing in outlet malls and off-price stores.A few brands have been able to retain some allure by rethinking their strategy. Calvin Klein revamped its high-end line last year and gained a breath of fresh air from hiring designer Raf Simons.Matched against their European counterparts, however, US brands still fall short.In his book,The Bling Dynasty: Why the Reign of Chinese Luxury Shoppers Has Only Just Begun, author Erwan Rambourg indicated thereâ€™s a hierarchy that puts US brands in the premium category, slightly behind European brands such as Cartier and Prada.Clode argued, however, that brands in China have a blank slate to engage with consumers at a more premium level.â€œUnlike mature markets in Europe, fashion and luxury is not intergenerational,â€? he said. â€œConsumers did not learn about brands from their parents. So the established pecking order that exists in mature markets is not as entrenched here.â€?A 2017 Bain & Company report predicted that Chinaâ€™s â€œwannabe consumersâ€?, or those who are aspirational, would be the fastest-growing consumer segment by 2020.America is â€¦ a country of immigrants, and many different cultures are mixed there, bringing more inspiration to designers to create differentlySpokesman for e-commerce website SecooBrands such as Michael Kors, which saw its revenue rise by double digits in China in the last quarter, are already benefiting from these shoppers. Ralph Lauren, which has been going through a restructuring in recent months, is likewise seeing double-digit growth.PVH Corp, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, was buoyed by a year-on-year increase in China sales in the 2017 financial year.Some US fashion designers have benefited from the race by luxury e-commerce websites to build up their brand portfolios.VIP.com recently announced it was â€œbroadening its US reach to include established and emerging brandsâ€?, introducing 10 new labels just months after launching Marc Jacobs on its high-end VIPLUX channel, alongside brands such as Versace, Sergio Rossi, Roberto Cavalli and Diesel.The e-commerce platform, which launched a New York operation in June, estimated it will triple its current sales of US goods in China from US$2.2 billion in 2017 to more than US$6 billion in 2020.High-luxury e-commerce website Secoo also has plans to introduce more US fashion designers to its brand mix. It already features both niche and masstige brands, ranging from Calvin Klein and Jack Rogers to Opening Ceremony and EF Collection.A Secoo spokesman was not able to provide exact sales data, but told the Post: â€œUS brands have quite a bright future and their sales performance is promising.â€œCompared to European brands,â€? he said, â€œUS brands have their own advantages: European luxury brands have a long history, but most US brands are newer and not limited to intrinsic design elements.â€œAmerica is also a country of immigrants, and many different cultures are mixed there, bringing more inspiration to designers to create differently.â€?The position of US brands in China today may be close to that envisaged by the Council of Fashion Designers in America (CFDA) and the Vogue Fashion Fund when they co-hosted an autumn/winter 2013 fashion show at the Great Wall of China for Proenza Schouler, Rag & Bone and Marchesa.It was part of a programme launched a year earlier to boost US fashion brandsâ€™ presence in Chinaâ€™s luxury market. Itâ€™s unclear why the CFDA has not returned to China since then. (The CFDA was contacted for comment, but a response was not received in time for publication.)For continued success, Clode said, US brands should not rely only on the fact that theyâ€™re accessible. Brands that take advantage of their cultural equity are going to get ahead. Clode cited Tory Burch, which nods to New York in its collaborations with model Liu Wen, but suggested that brands might want to consider more than just their visual identity.â€œThey need to think really strongly about distinctive stories and leveraging key parts of American culture that are known to these audiences,â€? Clode said.â€œBrands can arguably engage with the idea of New York much in the same way that French brands can engage with the idea of Paris. But I do not believe that American brands are conscious of their cultural power.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Beijing has again told global financial executives it will open its financial sector wider, under pressure from Western businesses for unrestricted access and despite signs of existing opening-up measures stalling.But foreign financial firms retain strong doubts about how opening it up will proceed, and under what conditions, with the trade war with the United States complicating matters by putting pressure on China to do more â€“ which China is loath to be seen to be responding to.â€œWe are making preparations, hoping that a few qualified foreign players can have their fully owned and fully licensed financial subsidiaries in China in three years,â€? Premier Li Keqiang told a small group of multinational company executives during the World Economic Forum (WEF) meetings in Tianjin last week.In April, the Chinese government released a timetable for allowing full foreign ownership of financial firms. The restriction limiting foreign ownership of Chinese banks to stakes of less than 50 per cent was scrapped straight away, with promises that ownership limits on Chinese securities and insurance operations would get the same treatment in three years, although there were still many technical issues to solve.Is China an open economy? Beijing says it is but IMF differsBut nearly six months after the bank ownership limit was lifted, none of the foreign applications to open fully owned banks in China have been approved.Liâ€™s own words at the WEF last week may signal reluctance on the part of the government, or at least some elements of it, to give foreign players a greater role in the domestic financial system any time soon.Finance is a â€œrelatively special sectorâ€? and its opening-up should â€œproceed in an orderly fashionâ€?, Li cautioned. â€œItâ€™s necessary for a big economy like China to maintain financial stability.â€?The financial system is the foundation of the Chinese economy and the ruling Communist Party desperately wants to maintain tight control of it. The trade war has complicated the entire reform process.Liu Shengjun, president of the China Financial Reform Institute, a Shanghai-based research group, attributed Beijingâ€™s slow progress on financial reforms to its fear of losing face in the middle of the trade conflict.â€œChina had hoped to complete more reforms and opening-up in exchange for US recognition, but now it feels it would be awkward to do so because the trade war has escalated,â€? Liu said.â€œIt has tried to deliver the message that it will actively pursue [reforms] for its own benefit, not because it is being forced to open up its market.â€?Liu said he believed communication channels between China and the US remained open. However, he added: â€œTrump wants no more â€˜I promiseâ€™ [on reforms], but rather actions to change policies right now.â€?China leaves door open for trade war talks but not with American â€˜knife at its throatâ€™Unlike 15 years ago, when foreign companies were warmly welcomed as strategic investors to help restructure ailing state-owned banks, the country now has four huge commercial banks that are deemed by international authorities to be critical elements of the global financial system.All four are state-owned, with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China the worldâ€™s largest financial institution.In contrast to foreign manufacturers, who struggle against rising labour costs, cancellations of preferential tax policies and forced technology transfer, some foreign banks are still keen to expand their China presence, especially with ventures that they control.China is letting in foreign firms, but will the financial market really be open?Morgan Stanley, UBS, Nomura and J.P. Morgan have all expressed interest in gaining controlling stakes in securities joint ventures, though none of their applications have been finally approved.Until recently, Chinese officials viewed certain top Wall Street executives as friends who could be counted on to convey their message to Washington.Now, many senior Wall Street executives are less willing to support Beijingâ€™s positions, partly because of the more assertive Donald Trump administration and partly due to their own dissatisfaction with the lack of reform progress.The combined market share of foreign banks in China is less than 5 per cent, and on-the-ground restrictions are highly visible.Last week, Li used large sections of his speech to address foreign concerns about market access, the uneven playing field and forced technology transfer, all key complaints of Trumpâ€™s administration.He was interrupted by bursts of warm applause each time he mentioned â€œexpanding the market entry of foreign investorsâ€? and â€œequal treatment for all China-registered firmsâ€?.Xi Jinpingâ€™s defence of globalisation and open markets: key takeaways from Chinese leaderâ€™s speech to Boao Forumâ€œWhen Chinese enterprises become more internationalised, there will be more growth room [for foreign banks in China],â€? said Joe Ngai, managing director in China for consulting firm McKinsey, who advises foreign financial institutions on their China-related businesses.Peter Reynolds, a partner at management consultancy Oliver Wyman, said Beijingâ€™s sense of timing is very different from that of European and American businesspeople, cautioning that full financial opening-up could be a â€œmulti-decade processâ€?.â€œThey have a time frame which is very different â€“ a long time frame,â€? Reynolds said. â€œWeâ€™ve passed a couple of milestones recently, accelerating along that journey, but [itâ€™s] a very long journey.â€?Reynolds suggested that foreign financial businesses focus on refining their China business strategy. A decade ago, the common strategy was â€œwe just want to enterâ€?, whereas today foreign financial institutions need a specific strategy for how to grow in China after the ownership issue is finally tackled, taking careful consideration of their target clients, their products and their competitive advantages in China, he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US plans to subsidise American farmers caught in the US-China trade war signal an escalation in the hostilities, Chinese analysts have warned.The administration of US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that it would roll out a three-part, US$12 billion plan to offset the effects of retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and other countries on American agricultural products, according to US Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue.Soybean giant Brazil swoops on US crop as China trade war punctures pricesPerdue said the plan was a short-term solution to the â€œillegalâ€? response by China, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and other major economies to aggressive US trade sanctions.â€œThe programmes we are announcing today are a firm statement that other nations cannot bully our agricultural producers to force the United States to cave in,â€? Perdue said.On Wednesday Trump accused China of targeting American farmers in a vicious way and using them as leverage to get concessions from him on trade.â€œChina is targeting our farmers, who they know I love and respect, as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the US,â€? Trump wrote on Twitter.â€œThey are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. We were being nice â€“ until now!â€?Chinaâ€™s soybean imports forecast to fall as tariffs hit and buyers switch to other animal feedOn July 6, Beijing hit back at US tariffs on US$34 billion in Chinese products with similar duties of its own on US goods, including soybeans, beef, pork, sorghum and fruit.China imported about US$24.1 billion in agricultural products from the US last year, accounting for about a fifth of total farm imports in 2017, according to Chinese customs agriculture ministry data.China is targeting our farmers, who they know I love & respect, as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U.S. They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. We were being nice - until now! China made $517 Billion on us last year. â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2018The Chinese tariffs mainly affect farmers and graziers in the American Midwest â€“ a key constituency for Trump and the Republicans.The tariffs dovetailed with suggestions from Chinese policy advisers that Beijing make a â€œprecision strikeâ€? aimed at agriculture and the Republican heartlands, in the hope of pressuring the president and his party before the midterm elections in November.Liu Weidong, a US affairs expert from the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that with just 20 days since the start of the tariffs it was too early to tell if they had been effective.Look to Eurasia, China tells grain traders as tariffs on US soybean kick inLiu said the subsidies were probably a preventive measure by Trump to ease the anxiety of his constituencies because he was worried those voters might reconsider their support if the Chinese duties took hold.â€œWith the subsidies, he could mitigate the Chinese retaliation to some extent,â€? he said.Wang Huiyao, president of the think tank the Centre for China and Globalisation, said Trump was also trying to show to China and other countries that he was determined to carry on with the trade war.â€œThis is psychological warfare and will have an effect on peopleâ€™s expectations,â€? Wang said.But Pan Rui from Fudan University said China should not overestimate the importance of the midterm elections to Trump. â€œEven if the Republicans lose some of their seats, Trump is unlikely to make dramatic changes to his foreign policies,â€? Pan said.He said the subsidies could be either a sign that Trump was bluffing with â€œmaximum pressureâ€? or he saw China as a strategic rival that he was willing to contain at all cost.â€œWe cannot exclude either possibility, but China would not want to see the latter,â€? he said.Trump has threatened to put tariffs on all of the US$500 billion or so in products China exports to the US each year, while China has vowed to hit back with â€œqualitative and quantitativeâ€? measures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chinese tourism to the United States is set to fall in next weekâ€™s National Day holidays, with flight bookings down and analysts saying numbers for the year are slowing as political tensions accelerate.There has been a dramatic 42 per cent decrease in flight bookings from China to the US in next weekâ€™s holidays â€“ known as â€œgolden weekâ€? â€“ compared with last yearâ€™s holiday week, according to travel fare search engine Skyscanner. Last yearâ€™s holiday period was one day longer.The first three quarters of 2018 have seen a 16.7 per cent drop in flight bookings from China to the US, its figures show.It comes as the American tourism industry watches with bated breath for signs of an impact on Chinese tourists visiting the country from the escalating US-China trade war, and on the back of travel advice issued by the Chinese embassy in the summer warning of the dangers of travel in the US.Chinese visitors to the US are a small group overall, but their spending power is outsized, ringing up US$34.8 billion in 2016 in retail, accommodation, travel and educational spending, according to US government data.â€œThereâ€™s a lot on the line here, for retailers and beyond â€“ travel has a tremendous downstream impact, from retail and restaurants to real estate,â€? a US Travel Association spokesman told the South China Morning Post.The fall in Chinese bookings is echoed by a report last month by ForwardKeys, a European travel research agency, which found that decreases in flight bookings from China to the US appear to mirror the heightening trade tensions since April.Chinese tourist numbers surge as overseas travel becomes easierThe number of tourists from China to the US so far this year has fallen almost 5 per cent on last year, it found. Weekly bookings rose in February and March, but started to decline in April when US President Donald Trump called on officials to draw up a list of tariffs on US$100 billion worth of imports from China.In April to August, it found, the tourism decline deepened, with Augustâ€™s flight bookings down 8.4 per cent on 2017, which came after an escalation in the value of tariffs in July.US-China trade war ramps up as tariffs on US$200 billion in Chinese imports take effectOverall, Chinese outbound travel worldwide stayed strong, growing at 5.5 per cent from the previous year, the ForwardKeys study found, based on 2018 data compiled from global airline booking databases.â€œIt looks like a trend,â€? said ForwardKeys spokesman David Tarsh, who predicts harm to the US economy caused by a downturn in Chinese tourism could reach half a billion dollars.â€œThe US runs a US$28 billion travel and tourism trade surplus with China,â€? said Jonathan Grella, spokesman at the US Travel Association, a Washington-based non-profit representing and advocating for the travel industry.â€œThe source of our concern is that these trade tensions could end up upsetting an economic dynamic that is really working for America right now,â€? Grella said, adding that the US$28 billion was calculated by the travel association using consumer spending data.The body currently predicts 2018 growth from last year will be 5 per cent. â€œWe donâ€™t have real-time data and usually the impact wouldnâ€™t be seen until a while after it happens,â€? Grella said. â€œA change in our relationship and a trade war wouldnâ€™t be immediately quantifiable.â€?There was concern, he said, this summer after the Chinese embassy in Washington issued new security advice this summer for travellers to the US.Chinese tourists in United States told to beware of shootings, expensive medical careComing a week before the Trump administration released a list on July 10 of US$200 billion worth of goods proposed for tariffs, it warned Chinese nationals about a litany of issues including searches from customs agents, gun violence, high costs of health, and robberies.Chinese tourists to the US numbered just over 3 million last year, dwarfed by more than 75 million tourists from other countries and the 130 million international trips Chinese tourists embarked on last year, according to Chinese state media.But their lavish spending is important for the US retail industry, according to Craig Shearman, spokesman at the National Retail Federation, based in Washington.â€œMany retailers have added staff who speak Chinese, put up Chinese-language signage, make announcements in Chinese and have added Union Pay credit card terminals to better serve customers from China,â€? Shearman said.Golden Week in China: the incredible numbers behind largest human migration in historyThe number of tourists from China to the US has grown more than 800 per cent in the past decade, according to the US Travel Association, driven up by factors such as joint 10-year visas that Chinese and Americans can hold for each othersâ€™ countries.Not everyone in the industry is predicting a downturn. Looking at data until the end of the first quarter, before tariffs escalated, Yihe Huang, of market research agency Mintel in Shanghai, expected tourism from China to the US would at least maintain 2017â€™s level, despite a stronger US currency and trade tensions.However, the US is not a major growth market for Chinaâ€™s tourists, said Huang.â€œChinese travellers are increasingly sophisticated and are willing to try more exotic, distant and less-known destinations,â€? Huang said, citing double-digit growth in places outside the classic hotspots like Thailand, Japan and the US. â€œVisiting the US is not a main driver for the outbound travel market in China.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"China and the United States should urgently resolve their trade bickering through dialogue before both end up in a lose-lose situation, the head of one of Americaâ€™s biggest industry groups has said in an interview with the Post.Rick Helfenbein, president and CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA) â€“ an advocacy group representing more than 1,000 major industry brands â€“ described the present situation as â€œdangerousâ€? and likened the trade war to an approaching tsunami.US President Donald Trump, in choosing to play hardball with China, stood only to antagonise all parties, from consumers and US retailers to the whole supply chain, Helfenbein said on Monday during a visit to Hong Kong.â€œThe trade war is like a family argument, which at one point needs a marriage counsellor,â€? he said. â€œIf they donâ€™t get one, they are heading to the divorce courts, which no one wants, and I donâ€™t think President Trump wants that either â€¦ He has overpushed [the tariffs issue].â€?Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have tentatively agreed to meet on the sidelines of the G20 leadersâ€™ summit in Buenos Aires in November, the Post reported last week.The trade war rhetoric has escalated in the run-up to next monthâ€™s US midterm elections. Helfenbein said Trump had moved the goalposts in the political game with China from American joblessness to trade deficits and lately to currency manipulation. He also said Trump was not clear what the country wanted to negotiate on â€“ tariffs, the South China Sea issue, investment in Africa, intellectual property or technology transfers.Helfenbein, who has been in the garment and footwear industry for more than 40 years, said he had never seen a trade war of this scale with any other country, and the two presidents needed â€œa big meeting and multiple meetingsâ€?, rather than talks on the sidelines of the G20, to resolve things before any damage was done.If [Trump and Xi] start talking to each other sooner, everyone will be a winner. If not, everyone will be a loserRick HelfenbeinHe warned that American consumers would have to pay more, factories could be forced out of China or out of business, and the sophisticated supply chain China had built in recent decades could be broken.â€œIf they start talking to each other sooner, everyone will be a winner,â€? Helfenbein said. â€œIf not, everyone will be a loser.â€?As a link between the two countries, Hong Kong would feel the knock-on effect, or â€œa bumpâ€? in its economy, if the trade war meant less cargo passing through the cityâ€™s ports, he added.Commerce minister Edward Yau Tang-wah told lawmakers on Monday that the trade war had added uncertainty to the cityâ€™s economic outlook, and that officials would seek to sign more free-trade deals as one of a number of longer-term countermeasures.Beijing and Washington have crossed swords since July when the first wave of tit-for-tat tariffs on goods kicked in. The White House imposed its latest round of 10 per cent tariffs in September, on US$200 billion worth of Chinese products â€“ mostly food and consumer goods. The tariffs will jump to 25 per cent on January 1 next year.â€œI told consumers in America, if they want to buy one product at Christmas, theyâ€™d better buy two, because no one knows how much more they are going to cost after Christmas,â€? Helfenbein said.The AAFA president also said America imported 41 per cent of clothing, 72 per cent of footwear and 84 per cent of accessories, such as bags, from China.â€œChina, Canada, Mexico, Japan and Germany are our top five trading partners. We pick fights with every single one of them. Why?â€? he said.Xi visits southern Chinaâ€™s hi-tech heartland for first time in six yearsThe AAFA was receiving many queries every day on what the tariffs would bring, which made it like â€œa marriage counsellorâ€?, he added.Helfenbein and his team, who arrived in Hong Kong on Monday morning, were expected to meet local industry representatives over the next couple of days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"China does not want a trade war with the United States but has no fears and will not back down, a senior official from the countryâ€™s top political advisory body has warned a group of American business leaders visiting the capital.Zhang Qingli, vice-chairman of the Chinese Peopleâ€™s Political Consultative Conference, made the comments at a Monday meeting with a 25-member delegation led by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.â€œWe donâ€™t fear a trade war. We donâ€™t want it, but we donâ€™t intend to back down,â€? Dan Eberhart, chief executive of oilfield drilling services company Canary LLC, quoted Zhang as saying at the meeting.Zhangâ€™s warning comes amid an escalating trade war between the worldâ€™s two largest economies.US President Donald Trump is pressing Beijing to change its â€œunfair trade practicesâ€? by imposing additional tariffs on Chinese imports, something China regards as an effort to contain the countryâ€™s rise.Zhang â€œprobably spoke for over one hourâ€? about three main issues, Eberhart recounted on Tuesday: Chinaâ€™s positive economic statistics, the Greater Bay Area scheme and the trade friction with the US.He called it a â€œone-way conversationâ€? and there was no question and answer session.Asked whether Zhang spoke of any chance for renewed trade negotiations between China and the US, Eberhart said the mainland official dropped few hints and his stance was firm.â€œIt doesnâ€™t seem like we are on the brink of a solution, really. It seems more like a warning that China is digging in its heels, ready to play this out with the Trump administration,â€? he added.â€œThe sense that I got is, the US created this problem, we [China] didnâ€™t pick this fight, we think we have a great trading relation with the US and itâ€™s been beneficial to both parties. That said, we will defend ourselves and donâ€™t fear it at all.â€?A separate visit to the Ministry of Commerce however proved to be less charged, said Eberhart, a Republican donor who contributed to Trumpâ€™s election campaign.The delegation, in the capital from Monday to Tuesday for the chamberâ€™s two-day â€œannual Beijing door knockâ€? visit, met Jiang Haiying, the departmentâ€™s first secretary for American affairs.â€œI would categorise the trade portion of that meeting as pro forma,â€? Eberhart said.â€œIt could have been the same talking points two years ago, five years ago, not necessarily salient to the current trade war.â€œThe context is more, we want trade, we want further development â€¦ we want Hong Kong and mainland China to have greater relations with the US.â€?The Greater Bay Area â€“ the national development scheme aimed at integrating Hong Kong, Macau and nine cities in Guangdong province into an innovation powerhouse to rival Silicon Valley â€“ was brought up at both meetings.Zhang, however, did not discuss the scheme in the context of the trade war or hint at a timetable for its long-awaited blueprint, Eberhart said.Washington escalated the trade war in September by imposing 10 per cent tariffs on US$200 billion worth of goods it imports from China and said the rate could rise to 25 per cent in January. Beijing responded with extra tariffs of between 5 and 10 per cent on US$60 billion worth of US goods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Executives at US multinational corporations have started taking measures to counter the impact of tariffs in the US-China trade war, but they must face a hard truth â€“ the acceleration of the dispute is introducing an unprecedented uncertainty to their businesses.In discussing their business outlooks recently, executives from the agricultural, food and manufacturing sectors said they were acting cautiously and taking one step at a time.On Monday, when Thomas Hayes, the chief executive officer at Tyson Foods, the largest meat supplier in the US, was asked his view on the prospects of the pork industry next year, he said: â€œWe donâ€™t have an assumption that they are going to improve. â€¦ We just donâ€™t know.â€?â€œItâ€™s hard to predict,â€? he said. â€œIf you have an answer on that one, Iâ€™m happy to hear it.â€?Trump rails against China during dinner with executivesMeat producers are front and centre in the trade war that began in April when US President Donald Trump first threatened tariffs on US$50 billion of Chinese goods. While many had expected progress in negotiations by now, Washington and Beijing instead embarked on tit-for-tat retaliation.Tariffs on US$34 billion worth of imported Chinese goods went into effect in July, with another US$16 billion in duties to be imposed in about two weeks.China answered with matching tariffs on US$50 billion worth of US imports; US$34 billion went into effect in July, and the list of American goods for the remaining US$16 billion was announced on Wednesday.China also said it would apply tariffs on another US$60 billion of imports if Trump moved forward with his latest threat: tariffs on an additional US$200 billion of Chinese goods.Over the weekend, Beijing said it was ready for â€œa protracted warâ€? and did not fear sacrificing short-term economic interests.Beijing issues new list of American goods to be hit with tariffsâ€œThe US sectors most at risk are those that depend on global supply chains,â€? said Dec Mullarkey, Massachusetts-based managing director at Sun Life Investment Management, an institutional investor with US$50 billion in managed assets.They are â€œall at risk of having productivity interrupted with pressure on costs and profits as they readjust. Most companies will look to pass tariffs along to the consumer but competition and alternative products will limit some pricing power,â€? said Mullarkey.On recent calls with shareholders and analysts, many executives have noted the unusual geopolitical events, saying they had brought unprecedented ambiguity.Tyson Foods last week cut its fiscal 2018 projections by about 85 cents a share, to as low as US$5.70 from US$6.55 earlier, citing â€œuncertainty in trade policies and increased tariffs negatively impacting domestic and export pricesâ€?.Stanley Black & Decker, a Fortune 500 manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware based in New Britain, Connecticut, estimated a US$35 million hit this year from tariffs on steel and aluminium, materials of obvious importance to the companyâ€™s product lines.Manufacturers know that one way to mitigate the impact of tariffs is to shift the chain of suppliers away from affected countries. Even so, there are trade-offs, and executives are wary.â€œWe also have to be cognisant that any time you move the supply chain around significantly, thereâ€™s cost associated with it and thereâ€™s also risk associated with it,â€? James Loree, CEO of Stanley Black & Decker, said a few weeks ago.â€œSo in the near, near term, there wonâ€™t be a lot of supply chain manoeuvring, it will be mostly price,â€? referring to price increase to counter the rise in costs associated with tariffs.The difficulty, Loree said, is that â€œwe really donâ€™t know the length of these tariffs.â€?China forced to be more restrained in US trade war to protect interestsIn hopes of bringing the trade war to an end, leaders of some global companies have taken on a role unusual for them, that of diplomats.â€œWe are standing up for responsive global trade that lets food move freely,â€? David MacLennan, Cargillâ€™s chairman and chief executive officer, wrote in a letter to shareholders on Tuesday.Cargill, a 153-year-old provider of agricultural and industrial products that is the largest privately held corporation in the US, has done business in China since the early 1970s.â€œWe advocated with policymakers to build upon existing trade agreements like those between the US, Mexico, Canada, China and South Korea, rather than walk away from the negotiating table,â€? MacLennan said.In May, Cargill, which is based in Minnesota, sent a five-page letter to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, contending that the tariffs then proposed by the US against China would â€œnot effectively advance the goal of addressing distortive trade practicesâ€?.US farmers, the letter continued, would be hurt the most â€œdue to declining pricesâ€? caused by â€œChinaâ€™s proposed retaliatory tariffsâ€?.It also argued that â€œthe use of tariffs is unsuccessful in achieving lasting solutions.â€?Cargill launched an advocacy website, fedbytrade.com, â€œto show how farmers, workers and consumers are better off thanks to global trade,â€? MacLennan said when announcing the companyâ€™s quarterly results last month.Trade war new blow for US beef as industry tries to regain China footholdAlso in July, John Flannery, the chairman and CEO of General Electric, said that while the company hadnâ€™t seen a major impact on its business yet this year from tariff-related costs, GE was â€œsupportive of fair and open tradeâ€?.GE imports about US$2.9 billion of Chinese goods into the US, and China generated more than US$7 billion in annual revenue for the conglomerate in fiscal 2017 â€“ about 6 per cent of its total.â€œWe hope and we expect that ultimately these matters reach a sensible negotiated conclusion. And we think thatâ€™s really in the best interest of all parties involved,â€? Flannery said during an earnings call with analysts.For now, many executives, and their businesses, have just one big question awaiting one big answer.As Loree of Stanley Blacker & Decker said: â€œWhat the lifespan of these tariffs is going to be, a couple of months, a couple of years, forever, who knows?â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The country is setting an example to the rest of Southeast Asia when it comes to attracting industryPresident Donald Trump is a game-changer and in so many ways. While Southeast Asia rarely features on his agenda, the Trump-initiated â€œtrade warâ€? could well end up resetting global manufacturing and the all-important supply chains as exporters seek to lessen their exposure to China.For the three giants of Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) with populations of over 90 million â€“ Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam â€“ this could be a major opportunity. Essentially, each of the three is vying to attract industrial investment and the attendant employment. To date, Vietnam has been the most successful.Indeed, Samsung, the worldâ€™s largest smartphone manufacturer, has invested over US$17 billion in Vietnam, contributing close to a quarter of Vietnamâ€™s total exports of US$214 billion in 2017 alone.Its two manufacturing plants â€“ Bac Ninh and Thai Nguyen, located outside the capital of Hanoi â€“ look like sprawling mini-cities as they spread across the Red River plain. And the facilities are huge â€“ employing more than 149 000 people.So, as the prospect of a major wave of industrial relocations from an increasingly expensive China becomes a reality, which of the three countries stands to benefit the most?Sadly, the Philippines, with its clapped-out infrastructure, expensive energy and notorious bureaucracy, remains the outlier.Vietnam leads the pack. For example, in 2017 alone, Vietnam attracted US$35.88 billion in foreign direct investment whilst Indonesia, with nearly three times the population, trailed behind attracting only US$32.34 billion.To my mind, there are four key issues determining national competitiveness.The first is education. All three countries have millions of young workers. The challenge is matching the workforce to industry requirements. Whilst Indonesia and Vietnam both produce well over 100,000 engineers every year, their suitability for employment is often questionable. There is also a looming shortage of engineers expected in the next two to five years. According to the Institution of Engineers Indonesia, the industry will be short of 280,000 engineers by 2023. VietnamWorks, a leading online recruitment agency, forecasts a lack of 500,000 IT engineers in 2020.Certainly, there needs to be greater emphasis on vocational training and placement based on the specific needs of industry.The second issue is nationalism. This barrier to business is generally rhetorical and much used by elite players with entrenched interests to shut out competition.Intriguingly, in Indonesia, more than 350 businesses in sixteen industries are on the governmentâ€™s negative (or proscribed) list. By way of comparison, Vietnamâ€™s communist government has limited the negative investment list to just fourteen strategic sectors which include broadcasting, import/export, airports and telecommunications.Whatever the case, governments need to be clear as to why certain sectors are excluded from foreign participation; is it a question of national security (defence industries) or preserving specific high-employment sectors (agriculture and food processing)?The third issue is democracy. Contrary to what liberal western media argue, most investors could not give a damn about democracy and human rights â€“ why else would hordes of American corporations have piled into the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China over the past few decades?It is important to distinguish between the principles of democracy and the issue of legal certainty. Multinational corporations (MNCs) are more comfortable operating in markets that respect the sanctity of contracts and have relatively incorruptible legal systems (such as Singapore). The inverse is true when it comes to the countless administrative regulations that torment MNC managers in countries such as Philippines and Indonesia. Needless to say, their eradication could make a significant difference to business expansion.The fourth issue is more nebulous â€“ namely the question of national â€œcharacterâ€? and history. The Vietnamese endured more than thirty years of war â€“ taking on a succession of aggressors from the French to the Americans and the Chinese. Economic reforms (dubbed Doi Moi) were only introduced in 1986, after which the country grew dramatically â€“ from a GDP of US$36.65 billion in 1987 to US$223.8 billion in 2017. Clearly, the past few decades have been a period of â€œcatching upâ€? as a younger generation enjoys the fruits of a more overtly capitalist economic system.The same cannot be said of Indonesia and the Philippines, where decades of so-called trickle-down economics have left many millions still poor and marginalised â€“ almost 26 million Indonesians alone live below the poverty line. Not to mention the deep suspicions of the Washington Consensus â€“ a set of economic policy prescriptions that appears to offer so much whilst delivering so little.So as Trump continues to rail against China, Southeast Asiaâ€™s giants have to make tough decisions to make themselves attractive for foreign investment. If not, this historic opportunity will be wasted and millions of manufacturing jobs will be lost to the region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Promising technologies are set to offer a growth in the global semiconductor industry, but executives are concerned that the sector will used as leverage in the US-China trade war, the Nikkei Asian Review reports.Global shipments of semiconductor equipment are expected to expand nearly upwards of 11 percent this year and 7.7 percent in 2019, creating four years of growth, the Nikkei Asian Review reports.With technologies supporting IoT and the adoption of artificial intelligence, it shows a growth in semiconductors, particularly to meet the needs of data centers. However, as some manufacturers of semiconductors are processing outstanding orders, some are worried about the trade disputes between the US and China.According to the Nikkei Asian Review, share prices have dropped by 20 percent for semiconductor manufacturers for Applied Materials and Lam Research since the tit-for-tat tariffs began between the US and China in March. The 25 percent on imported goods from China is a $30 million hit to the semiconductor supply chain. If tariffs are extended to memory chips, the Nikkei Asian Review reports that the number would increase to $500 million.However, the biggest fear within the industry is that the Trump Administration will restrict exports of semiconductors and chip manufacturing equipment to China, some of the US' biggest customers. The Nikkei Asian Review reports that, currently, US producers hold a 60 percent share of the global market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kerry on U.S. waging a trade war with China -- 'Disastrous' 1 / 7 Back to GalleryChina is ready to 'go the distance' in any tariff-driven trade war with the United States, and ex-Secretary of State John Kerry has a one-word prediction of its consequences for the U.S. --: 'Disastrous.''It would result in a recession and possibly worse,' Kerry said in an interview with Seattle P-I. The senator-turned-top-diplomat was in Seattle to discuss his new book 'Every Day is Extra.'The secretary's remarks came on a day that President Trump was imposing $200 billion worth of new tariffs on Chinese goods, escalating the conflict with China begun by the 45th president. Handbags, rice and textiles are included in the latest round of taxes, which take effect Sept. 24th.A trade war will not be concluded easily or painlessly, Kerry argued. Countries respond to higher tariffs by developing 'different supply strains,' said Kerry. They respond be taking their business elsewhere.'You don't make that up quickly,' Kerry added. 'Take agricultural exports. They find new supplies. Again, you don't make that up quickly.'RELATED: Connelly: Trump below 40 percent job approval in two national pollsHigher tariffs mean higher prices. With near full employment, and corporations enriched by 'the tax cut most Americans didn't get,' America has seen some modest wage increases.If tariffs trigger retaliation, 'They're all going to be chewed up by the higher price of goods,' Kerry predicted.Kerry was in China recently, watching senior Chinese officials watch Trump.'They're very polite,' he said. 'They don't know what (U.S. policies are day-to-day.'What Trump doesn't understand, as a man who doesn't read or listen, is that China 'has the cash' in Kerry's words. He points to China's massive Belt and Road project of highways and shipping lanes, aimed at linking China with 70 countries of Asia, Europe, Africa and the Pacific.'Trump doesn't understand any of this,' said Kerry. 'He believes we can whack 'em around with impunity. And he's wrong.'Washington is the nation's most trade dependent state. China buys its airplanes, but also its cherries, and also products of small manufacturers. A maker of piano stands in Yakima was one of the state's most vocal supporters of renewing the U.S. Export Import Bank.One more point stressed by Kerry: If Americans are expected to support the global economy, they must benefit from it. 'Workers have not benefited,' he argued. 'Globalism is not a positive for too many Americans.'The solution, he argued, wages must go up, health care must must be assured, and Americans should not be working two or three jobs to support a family.'America needs a new trade relationship with the American worker,' Kerry said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fewer Chinese business executives, tourists and students are visiting the United States, a sign that the trade war between Washington and Beijing might spread in unpredictable and costly ways.The nascent decline â€“ visible in visa approvals and airline bookings â€“ isnâ€™t the result of official action by Beijing. But it highlights a potent weapon that China could use if the trade war persists: slashing the $60 billion that Chinese consumers spend each year on American services such as travel and tourism.Already, 102,000 fewer Chinese people received business, leisure and educational visas from May through Septemberof this year compared with the same period last year, a 13 percent drop, according to State Department statistics.Chinese airline reservations to U.S. destinations dropped 42 percent for the first week of October, a national holiday that normally means increased outbound trips, according to Skyscanner, a search engine owned by Chinaâ€™s largest travel company.Unlike merchandise trade, for which President Donald Trump often complains about the large deficit with China, the United States enjoys a sizable services surplus â€“ making such commerce a large and potentially vulnerable target in a lengthy trade war. Since 2011, U.S. services trade with China has grown more than three times as fast as the shipments of goods that Trump usually focuses on.â€œWe have expected that they will try a whole range of things to encourage us to back down,â€? said a senior administration official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. â€œItâ€™s not going to work. But we would hope China wouldnâ€™t do that.â€?Chinaâ€™s done it before. During a diplomatic dispute with South Korea last year, the Chinese government banned the sale of package tours to Seoul and Jeju Island. The boycott cost South Korean businesses nearly $7 billion in just a few months, as Chinese tourists obeyed their governmentâ€™s orders to head elsewhere.Launching a similar boycott against the United States would risk alienating millions of middle-class Chinese who put a premium on American education and thirst for American vacations.But a consumer embargo could deprive the U.S. travel industry of its most lucrative customers â€“ Chinese tourists spend an average of $6,900 on each trip â€“ and hurt American universities that have enjoyed a surge in enrollment by Chinese students.China last year sent more than 350,000 college students to the United States, almost twice as many as India, the No. 2 source.At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, one of the most popular options for students from places like Beijing or Shanghai, Chinese students last year numbered 5,845, compared with just 950 a decade earlier. Foreign students are attractive to such schools because they generally pay far higher tuition than state residents do.If China chooses to widen the trade war by curbing its citizensâ€™ spending on travel, financial services or consulting contracts, the United States would feel the impact more quickly than if Beijing levied additional tariffs on American goods, according to Joy Dantong Ma, a research associate at the Paulson Institute in Chicago.Chinese manufacturers need time to rearrange complex supply chains, but Chinese consumers can easily change vacation plans to visit Tuscany rather than Napa Valley, she said.â€œIf itâ€™s going to escalate, youâ€™d expect it to move to other channels like tourism,â€? Ma said. â€œThe services industries are very different from goods exports. When demand for some thing disappears, you donâ€™t see it immediately. But when demand for services goes, the numbers drop off right away.â€?By far the biggest services category is travel and tourism, which last year brought American airlines, hotels and tourist operators $32 billion, twice as much as all U.S. aircraft sales to China, according to the Commerce Department.â€œWe have a good thing going with China,â€? said Jonathan Grella, executive vice president for public affairs at the U.S. Travel Association, an industry group that met last month with Trump at the White House to share their concerns about a decline in foreign tourist arrivals.Before Deng Xiaoping began opening the economy to foreign influence in the late 1970s, Chinese citizens who wanted to travel were required to obtain the permission of their work units and local police authorities. Tourist departures were minuscule.But as China has grown more prosperous, the number of Chinese going abroad has soared. Nearly 3 million visitors arrived in the United States in 2016, the most recent annual data available, up from just 525,000 in 2009, according to the Commerce Department.â€œThis is not just any market,â€? said Grella, who says his members have yet to detect a visitor decline. â€œChina is viewed differently â€“ the sheer size and economic potential.â€?Chinese leaders may hesitate to boycott the United States, however, for fear of angering middle-class citizens who covet American diplomas for their children or just want to see Hollywood or Manhattan. In July, when a young Mongolian man detonated a small bomb near the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, people were back in the outdoor visa line less than an hour later, even as the bomberâ€™s blood pooled on the sidewalk.â€œThis so-called trade war is just a political game between state leaders of China and the U.S. . . . If you decided to not travel to the U.S. just because you hate Trump, then you would probably also have joined a boycott against U.S. products if Hillary Clinton was president. Nationalism is not going to take us anywhere,â€? said a 50-year-old man who applied this month for a visa to visit Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas and would provide only his surname, Zhou. â€œMoney and curiosity is.â€?Zhou waited in line outside the U.S. Embassy in Beijing for 6 1/2 hours to submit his visa form, an indication that blacklisting the United States would be far tougher than barring Chinese travelers from visiting South Korea.â€œI just think itâ€™s unlikely,â€? said Andy Rothman, an investment strategist with Matthews Asia. â€œThe U.S. is a bigger and more important place than Korea. The ties are more important. Thereâ€™d be a lot of pushback from Chinese people.â€?So far, the dispute between the worldâ€™s two largest economies has been confined to their $635 billion in annual goods trade. Trump has imposed tariffs on roughly half of what Americans buy from China every year, and China has retaliated with similar levies on most of its smaller volume of orders from the United States.Because China buys far less from the United States than it sells to Americans, it canâ€™t match Trumpâ€™s tariffs dollar for dollar. Chinese officials for now donâ€™t appear eager to escalate the conflict, hoping that a negotiated outcome after the U.S. congressional elections remains possible.But that could change if negotiations stall â€“ and both sides appear to be digging in for a fight. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the G-20 summit next month in Buenos Aires, but few analysts expect a diplomatic breakthrough.â€œPresident Trump is serious about it, that if they donâ€™t behave a little better, stop stealing our intellectual property, lower their tariffs on our products, then, you know, this could continue longer,â€? Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNBC earlier this month.Trade-war tensions are rattling nerves on both sides of the Pacific. In July, the Chinese Embassy in Washington warned its citizens that traveling to the United States risked high medical bills, gun violence and street crime. â€œPublic security in the United States is not good,â€? the embassy said.The alert contributed to the United States dropping to No. 9 on a list of the most popular destinations for Chinese tourists, down from No. 6 in 2017, according to Ctrip, the largest travel company in China.In Los Angeles, Chinese touristsâ€™ most-visited U.S. destination, tourism officials are cautious about potential trade-war fallout. The cityâ€™s tourism board, which has offices in four Chinese cities, says the 1.2 million Chinese visitors expected this year are more than twice the number who came in 2013.Along with seeing traditional attractions such as Universal Studios or a Los Angeles Lakers game, many Chinese tourists also shop for gifts to bring home, said Kathy Smits, vice president of the Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board.â€œWe are absolutely keeping a close eye on it because it is a market thatâ€™s impacted by what destinations are looked upon favorably,â€? Smits said. â€œJust because weâ€™re positive right now doesnâ€™t mean there couldnâ€™t be a change in the short term.â€?â€”The Washington Postâ€™s Danielle Paquette and Lyric Li in Beijing contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Worldâ€™s largest duty-free seller would see a gain amid new tariffs.As the world frets over a looming trade war, one company sees an opportunity.Dufry, the worldâ€™s largest duty-free retailer, would thrive in a more restrictive trade environment, Chief Executive Officer Julian Diaz said in an interview. Thatâ€™s because tax-free airport shops could gain a bigger price advantage over other retailers if governments impose new levies on imports.â€œWeâ€™re not subject to taxes, weâ€™re not subject to duties â€” if there are taxes and duties at the border, for us itâ€™s better,â€? Diaz said, adding that he nevertheless hopes openness prevails. â€œIâ€™m a citizen of the world, and free trade is probably the best thing.â€?The Basel, Switzerland-based company sells an array of products â€” from cigarettes and cosmetics to $45,000 bottles of Macallan 1937 Scotch whisky â€” through shops in international airports and other border crossings, where purchases avoid trade-related fees as long as the goods immediately leave the country. Discounts to street prices can be as much as 40 percent on some items.The U.S. is scheduled to impose tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese exports on Friday. China has said it will place levies on an equal value of U.S. goods, which would in turn lead to additional penalties from the U.S. The European Union Commission has said it would retaliate against U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum with tariffs on American products such as denim jeans and bourbon whiskey.Dufry is watching Brexit proceedings with similar interest. With Britainâ€™s departure from the EU less than nine months away, the two sides have yet to decide on their future trade relationship or the duration of a transition period. Large manufacturers such as Airbus and BMW have warned theyâ€™ll have to pull investment from Britain if barriers are put up to trade with the EU.â€œItâ€™ll be very important for usâ€? because Dufry would benefit from travelers entering and leaving the U.K., Diaz said. â€œMany countries will be impacted.â€?Luxury group Richemont bought a 5 percent stake in Dufry last year and later raised it to 7.5 percent. As the Swiss company has raised its investment, Chinaâ€™s HNA Group Co., which bought a 21 percent stake in Dufry last year, has lowered its economic interest to less than 1 percent.The Asia, Middle East and Australia region makes up a mere 10 percent of Dufryâ€™s total sales, though Asia is the fastest-growing market. While Diaz said Dufry always considers acquisitions, itâ€™s still consolidating the activities of the past four years. In 2015, Dufry acquired Italian rival World Duty Free for $3 billion, a year after purchasing Nuance Group for some $1.7 billion.As Dufry awaits international trade developments, itâ€™s getting a boost from a continued rise in Chinese travelers. Diaz said heâ€™s noticed more middle-class Chinese are visiting Dufryâ€™s airport stores, spending on mass-market items. Instead of watches and jewelry, these new consumers are buying more affordable items.â€œThere are more Chinese travelers â€” in fact, by 2020 thereâ€™ll be close to 200 million Chinese traveling â€” and theyâ€™re not all millionaires,â€? Diaz said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some Chinese pet owners donâ€™t trust local pet food and will taste it themselves before serving it. They now have fewer choices, as China takes aim at U.S. products.SHANGHAI â€” Olivia Ren never expected a trade war between the United States and China to affect Dada.Dada is Renâ€™s beloved golden retriever, and she pays heavily in Shanghai for an imported U.S. brand of pet food called Canidae so that he can eat the best. Ren often tastes his food herself to make sure it isnâ€™t rancid or poisonous, as she believes Chinese pet food can sometimes be.Now Canidae and other U.S. brands have become collateral damage in a trade war that encompasses hundreds of billions of dollars in goods that flow between the two countries. Pet-food industry experts say revenge-minded Chinese officials have been delaying shipments at customs since May to get back at the United States. New tariffs in July have also made imported pet food more expensive.In June, desperate for supplies, Ren bought 200 pounds of Canidae for Dada and for her boyfriendâ€™s dog, a French bulldog named Houhou.â€œI have nightmares that wake me up with anxiety about not being able to buy Canidae anymore,â€? she said.Ren is not the only Chinese pet owner taking action. Austin Chen, a Guangzhou resident, has been stocking up for his orange tabby, Fera, in case his U.S. brand of cat food is next.â€œIt is the first time,â€? he said, â€œthat I realized the trade war deeply influenced my life and my cat.â€?Choosy pet owners like Chen are a small minority in China, but their pain could presage broader tensions as the trade war deepens. Chinaâ€™s retaliatory tariffs have made imported soybeans and meat more expensive in a country that depends on imports for many of its food needs. Attitudes in China could harden if a lengthy trade war leads to higher prices, but it could also put pressure on Beijing to win concessions or cave â€” and both options carry big risks for Chinaâ€™s leaders.Pet food may seem an unlikely target in a trade war, but it shows how creative Chinese officials must become if they want to hit back at President Donald Trump. China doesnâ€™t import enough to match dollar-for-dollar Washingtonâ€™s tariffs on more than $250 billion in Chinese goods. Instead, Beijing has taken a series of unorthodox moves, such as blocking a huge corporate takeover and tying up imported cars in administrative knots at Chinaâ€™s docks.Pets in China have become big business. Soaring real estate prices and other costs have made it prohibitively expensive for many city dwellers to start families. Many have chosen to buy animals instead.According to China Securities, a Beijing brokerage, pet spending in China has surged more than eightfold since 2010, to about $25 billion a year, mostly on cats and dogs. The market is still growing. China has four times as many people as the United States but roughly half the number of household pets, with 51 million dogs and 41 million cats.And many people simply donâ€™t trust Chinese pet food. In a country where even infant formula and childhood vaccines have had quality problems, pet owners often view imported products as safer.Regardless of where it comes from, some owners like Ren try the pet food themselves. If it smells or tastes like rotting fish, decomposing chicken or other unpleasantries, they wonâ€™t let their pets take a bite.â€œIf dog food is not fresh, it tastes very much like stale cooking oil with fat,â€? said Ruan Qionghao, another Shanghai owner of a golden retriever, named Mixiu.There are no publicly available, peer-reviewed studies of problematic pet food in China. But Chinese consumers are wary of a wide range of domestic products, particularly after six children were killed and nearly 300,000 sickened by contaminated infant formula a decade ago, and nearly a million childhood vaccines were exposed this summer as defective.In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has been issuing warnings since 2014 about pet food jerky from six Chinese companies. That same year, the American retail chain Petco said it would halt sales of pet food from China. PetSmart, another big American retailer, quickly followed, though Chinese products continue to be sold at many U.S. stores.In a separate scandal, waste chemicals from plastics manufacturing were found in 2007 to have been used as a low-cost filler in Chinese pet food exported to the United States.â€œDomestic pet food is poisonous,â€? said Elaine Sun, a poodle owner in Wuxi, a city near Shanghai. â€œNo matter how good they say it is, I will never trust it.â€?Ding Limin, a pet nutrition expert at China Agricultural University and member of a government-affiliated commission on animal feed standards, said that it was little different in nutrition and quality from imported pet food.Trade policies have long affected Chinaâ€™s pet food scene. Beijing bans wholesale imports of pet food with beef or chicken, citing fears of mad cow disease or bird flu, though it loosened rules two years ago to allow imports to be sold online. Partly as a result of the restrictions, last year China exported $148 million worth of pet food to the United States but imported only $6.5 million worth.China also began allowing some wholesale imports of U.S. beef for people last year.Industry officials in China say importing pet food from the United States has become tougher since May, and that the trade war is to blame. EPet, a Chinese online marketplace, said in mid-September that import controls were tightening and officials were carrying out more inspections.â€œSadly, our pet food industry has been influenced by the trade storm,â€? the company said.Roy Cheng, an import agent in Shanghai for American pet food, said his products were inspected at least six times in the past two months. Before the trade war, inspections took place less than once a month, he said.â€œI am turning myself into a politician, watching trade war news every day, even though I only sell pet food,â€? he said.Vivian Li, the China representative for Halo, a pet food producer in Tampa, Florida, said the company was set to enter the Chinese market this year but had been dismayed to see ever-tighter customs inspections and the 25 percent tariffs.â€œIt is a very tough time for us,â€? Li said.Wang Jinquan, director of the pet nutrition and food processing research office at the government-affiliated Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said in August that the timing of the disappearance of American-made pet food from online marketplaces was coincidental. He said that China had recently aimed its enforcement efforts only at â€œthose brands that failed to meet laws and regulations.â€?Chinaâ€™s General Administration of Customs did not respond to requests for comment.Robert B. Zoellick, a former United States trade representative, said in an interview in Beijing last month that pet food could be an area for compromise between the two countries.â€œThereâ€™s an expansion of the pet culture here, so donâ€™t we want to keep them healthy?â€? he said. â€œIn this case, youâ€™ve got very lovable, cuddly consumers.â€?But for now, pet food may remain a hostage of the trade war. Ren, Dadaâ€™s owner, recently found online and bought a scarce bag of Canidae, but she was told it was stuck in customs. She canceled instead.â€œI would rather cook it myself,â€? she said. â€œDogs are like humans: If you have good food, you wonâ€™t go to the hospital as often.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Trump clears deck for China trade war with new NAFTA deal 1 / 1 Back to GalleryPresident Donald Trump looks to be preparing for a potentially protracted economic war with China by clearing the decks of disputes with America's other trading competitors.In just the last few weeks, he's struck a last-minute deal with Canada and Mexico, signed a trade agreement with South Korea and convinced Japan to begin bilateral economic negotiations. The North American accord also includes provisions seemingly aimed at keeping Chinese products out of the region.'Several months ago the U.S. had a multi-pronged attack on its trading partners,' said Dec Mullarkey, managing director for Sun Life Investment Management which oversees $47 billion in assets. 'Now the U.S. can zero in on China.'That's good news and bad news for the global economy. On the plus side, it suggests that Trump is not an ultra-isolationist who's opposed to all types of trade. As economists from JPMorgan Chase & Co. see it, the president is holding back from launching a 'war on trade' that could upend the world economy.But he is embarking on a trade war with China that will take a bite out of both countries' economies next year and raise the risk of a broad pullback in global business confidence, they said in a Sept. 28 research note.'It's too early to talk' with China, Trump said on Monday in announcing the new pact with Canada and Mexico at the White House. 'Can't talk now, because they're not ready, because they've been ripping us for so many years. It doesn't happen that quickly.'U.S. negotiators clearly had China in mind when they hammered out the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada to replace the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement that Trump labeled a disaster.'A small but important part' of the pact is aimed at China, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on National Public Radio on Tuesday.The agreement's rules of origin, which govern how much value of a car needs to be made in the region, have been touted by the Trump administration as a tool to keep out Chinese inputs and encourage production and investment in the U.S. and North America.'The U.S. seems focused on keeping Chinese imports from gaining real market share in the U.S.,' said Flavio Volpe, president of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturer's Association. 'The blunt protectionist stick used by this administration may end up creating a coalition of major trading partners that will be difficult for Chinese carrots to compete with.'The revised agreement also requires the three nations to give three-months' notice if they start trade negotiations with a 'non-market economy,' an indirect reference to China. The U.S. can terminate its pact with Mexico or Canada if either of them strikes a deal with a non-market economy.Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland on Monday downplayed the importance of the provision, saying the countries could always terminate the agreement if they wanted to. That is 'a possibility which exists no matter what,'' she told reporters in Ottawa.The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, also prohibits its members from seeking to boost their economic competitiveness by devaluing their currencies, something Trump has accused China of doing in the past.By settling on a deal with America's neighbors - and beginning talks with allies Japan and the European Union - Trump is strengthening his negotiating position vis-a-vis strategic competitor Beijing.'The next step will be to bear down on China with a broader coalition,' said David Hensley, director of global economics for JPMorgan Chase in New York, noting that other countries share America's concerns about Beijing's alleged unfair trade practices and mercantilism.The trade ministers of the U.S., the European Union and Japan issued a joint statement last week squarely aimed at China, pledging to 'address non market-oriented policies and practices of third countries' and condemning the theft of intellectual property from multinational corporations.'If the U.S. were to strike new deals with its major trading partners, many of which are also key trading partners of China, Beijing could feel increasingly cornered,' said Eswar Prasad, a former China expert at the International Monetary Fund who now teaches at Cornell University.Terry Haines, head of political analysis for Evercore ISI, said in a note to clients on Monday that his base case is that the U.S. and China won't strike an agreement until 2019 at the earliest.'But the new NAFTA deal does show China and others that the Trump administration is willing to conclude new trade deals as long as they address core U.S. concerns,' he said.That though may be difficult for Beijing to do. That's because the Trump administration is pressing for major changes in the way China manages its economy via subsidies and government-directed industrial policy.'The things they're asking for are pretty much unattainable,' said Phil Levy, senior fellow on global economy at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a former trade economist in George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers.Trump himself seemed to allude to the difficulties ahead in his comments to reporters on Monday.'They do whatever they want,' he said, referring to Beijing, adding, 'We have a lot of catching up to do with China.'- - -With assistance from Bloomberg's Josh Wingrove.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Trump risks trade war to keeping political promise on tariffsPresident Trump greets U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer after signing an order on tariffs Thursday. President Trump greets U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer after signing an order on tariffs Thursday. Photo: Chip Somodevilla Photo: Chip Somodevilla Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Trump risks trade war to keeping political promise on tariffs 1 / 1 Back to GalleryWASHINGTON â€” As he blitzed through the industrial Midwest as a presidential candidate, Donald Trump pitched himself as the savior of the â€œforgottenâ€? men and women in communities where factories had been shuttered and jobs were moved overseas.Now, Trump is risking a trade war to fulfill a political promise to the voters who helped put him in the White House.His decision to levy stiff new tariffs on aluminum and steel imports puts him at odds with most of the Republican Party, prominent business groups and even some of his own advisers, who warn that the decision could backfire and slow economic growth in a midterm election year. According to economic analysts, some of the communities that would be hardest hit by a trade standoff could be the same ones the president says heâ€™s aiming to help.Yet those arguments had little resonance with Trump during the fiery battle over tariffs that has played out in the West Wing in recent days. Having overcome the opposition, Trump relished Thursdayâ€™s signing ceremony, where he was flanked by steelworkers â€” some carrying their hard hats â€” who lavished praise on his decision.â€œIâ€™m delivering on a promise I made during the campaign,â€? Trump said. Gesturing to the workers, Trump said part of the reason heâ€™s in the White House was â€œbecause of you and my message having to do with you.â€?Current and former White House officials often describe the president as being preoccupied with keeping campaign promises to his loyal supporters, even if those decisions are unpopular with a broader swath of Americans. In public and in private, Trump still speaks frequently of his victories 16 months ago in Democratic-leaning states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, where working-class white voters helped propel him to victory. Heâ€™ll likely need to carry those states again if he hopes to win re-election in 2020.In Pennsylvania, both the Republican and Democratic candidate running in next weekâ€™s House special election endorsed the broad outlines of the presidentâ€™s approach on tariffs during a recent debate. Trump plans to campaign for Republican Rick Saccone on Saturday.However, most GOP lawmakers have balked at Trumpâ€™s approach, which includes exemptions for Mexico and Canada and the opportunity for other countries to appeal for a similar reprieve. Lawmakers fear a trade war could wipe away economic gains and leave them on shaky ground with voters in November.Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin called the tariffs â€œa very risky actionâ€? that could put agricultural and manufacturing jobs in his state and across the country at risk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Trump may prefer a trade war to a deal with China 1 / 1 Back to GalleryPresident Donald Trump seems to be digging in for a full-fledged trade war with China. On Monday, the White House announced that it will impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, a move that follows the apparent failure of recent talks between U.S. and Chinese officials. The new salvo will overshadow - or perhaps wholly undermine - a recent invitation from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to Beijing to rekindle negotiations.Earlier in the day, Trump displayed his appetite for a fight in a series of tweets hailing his protectionist maneuvers, which he claims have significantly boosted the U.S. economy. White House officials later told my colleagues that Trump will further add to the new slate of tariffs on China should Beijing retaliate, as it is expected to do.Trump tweeted 'Tariffs have put the U.S. in a very strong bargaining position, with Billions of Dollars, and Jobs, flowing into our Country - and yet cost increases have thus far been almost unnoticeable. If countries will not make fair deals with us, they will be 'Tariffed!''But in the short term, at least, the punitive measures aimed at China - which Trump accused of posing 'a grave threat to the long-term health and prosperity of the United States economy' - will hurt Americans more.'Trump has ordered aides to set the tariffs at 10 percent, likely leading to higher prices for American consumers. These tariffs are paid by U.S. companies that import the products, though they often pass the costs along to U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices,' my colleagues reported over the weekend. 'The U.S. imports roughly $500 billion in Chinese goods each year, and - combined with existing tariffs - these new penalties would cover half of all goods sent to the U.S. from China each year.'The new tariffs are part of a greater effort by Trump to confront Beijing. After his administration imposed import duties on Chinese goods earlier this summer, China responded with tit-for-tat measures its officials argued were gestures of restraint. Now, rather than cooling tensions, Trump is opting for escalation, seeing a potential trade war as a winning political strategy at home ahead of the November midterms and his own 2020 reelection bid.This goes against the instincts of many senior Wall Street executives and even some White House advisers, who, though happy with Trump's tax cuts, are less thrilled by his willingness to unleash chaos upon the global economy. On Sunday, a group of leading American financiers met their counterparts in Beijing for a meeting on U.S.-China business ties that seemed to underscore their diminished clout.'The Trump administration's trade hawks have so far prevailed against Wall Street-friendly voices of trade moderation, such as Mr. Mnuchin, a onetime Goldman Sachs executive,' noted the New York Times. 'That is partly because the trade war hasn't shown President Trump much downside. His stance has won support from both parties. The United States economy shows few signs of trade-war damage, and markets continue to rise.'But that rosy outlook may not last long. 'Favorable economic conditions still put the United States in a strong position,' wrote Marie Kasperek of the Atlantic Council. 'Yet experts caution that this soon will change, as the impact of additional tariffs would reverse economic tailwind created by the combination of more government spending and the hefty tax cuts.'U.S. farmers are already feeling the pain of retaliatory tariffs enacted by China, the European Union and other countries targeted by the Trump administration trade actions. Future reprisals from Beijing could raise costs even further for U.S. manufacturers.At the financiers' forum in Beijing on Sunday, Lou Jiwei, a former Chinese finance minister, suggested that China could target the supply chains of prominent U.S. companies, like Apple, that are dependent on Chinese manufacturing. Though alarming to many American executives, such rhetoric would gladden some of the trade hawks within the Trump administration, who would love to further 'decouple' the U.S. and Chinese economies.That's something analysts in both countries would have deemed unthinkable before Trump's ascension. But now, as some Trump allies hope to foster a split, Chinese President Xi Jinping is also actively pushing for his country's independence from U.S.-made technology.White House officials emphasize that Trump is adopting the hard line his predecessors failed to, and that the administration is still open to substantive dialogue. 'We are willing to talk with China any time if they are willing to move toward serious talks to remedy the trade problems,' said Larry Kudlow, Trump's national economic adviser, on Monday. 'On something of substance, [Trump's negotiating team wants Chinese counterparts to] just say yes. Just say yes to a couple of things and then we can move ahead.'Binyamin Appelbaum tweeted 'The Trump administration plans to announce a large tax increase on American consumers this evening. 'Tariff' is just a fancy word for 'tax.''But Trump's bullying approach won't be the ticket with Beijing, whose leadership - and public - don't respond well to threats. 'Getting the Chinese to the bargaining table should be all about face-saving - not a chest-thumping exercise,' said James Zimmerman, a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, to my colleague Danielle Paquette. 'Xi has no choice but to stand firm and stand tall.'The expert view in China increasingly casts Trump's trade policies as part of a wider campaign to challenge - or impede - China's geopolitical rise. 'It's getting more and more obvious that the Trump administration is determined to contain China,' said Shi Yinhong, a foreign affairs expert at Renmin University in Beijing, to the Financial Times. 'I think the next round of tariffs is inevitable. The trade war will last for quite a long time.'As Paquette reported, China's middle class, oft animated by nationalist currents, wants to see Beijing take a tough line against Trump.'China will choose the most favorable and powerful way to counterattack,' read an editorial in the Global Times, a particularly strident state mouthpiece. 'We are looking forward to a more beautiful counterattack that will make American pain worse.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shaheen Questions Top Administration Officials on Trumpâ€™s Trade War(Washington, DC) â€“ U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), the lead Democrat of the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee, questioned top Trump administration officials during a hearing this morning on the Presidentâ€™s trade war and its damaging impact on the New Hampshire economy. In addition, Shaheen warned that any deal to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) must include Canada, which is New Hampshireâ€™s largest trading partner.Shaheen specifically questioned administration officials on President Trumpâ€™s decision to impose tariffs on our allies, including Canada. Shaheen cited a Department of Defense (DoD) memorandum, which stated, â€œDoD continues to be concerned about the negative impact on our key allies,â€? regarding the administrationâ€™s decision to apply steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and the European Union.Senator Shaheenâ€™s line of questioning can be viewed here.Shaheen also raised concerns about the impact of the administrationâ€™s decision to shift resources away from helping small businesses export in favor of implementing tariffs, stating, â€œUnfortunately, the administration has also used these agencies to carry out what I believe is an ill-advised trade war that is putting up new barriers to trade for Americaâ€™s small businesses. Iâ€™m particularly concerned that the administrationâ€™s burdensome and opaque exemption process for steel and aluminum tariffs has created a mountain of red tape, forcing small businesses to spend precious time and resources to rework their operations.â€?Shaheen urged the President to heed the warnings of Congress and end the trade war, concluding, â€œIn particular, I urge the President to reach an agreement with Canada. Like all of us, I will be watching this issue closely, especially because Canada is New Hampshireâ€™s largest trading partner, as it is for all of the United States. Any new deal regarding NAFTA that cuts such a key ally out of the agreement will lose my support.â€?Shaheenâ€™s full opening remarks can be viewed here.This morningâ€™s hearing focused on the Presidentâ€™s fiscal year (FY) 2019 funding request for three of the nationâ€™s federal trade agencies, including the International Trade Administration, the Bureau of Industry and Security and the U.S. International Trade Commission.Senator Shaheen is strongly opposed to the administrationâ€™s tariff policy, which has escalated a trade war with China, as well as critical US allies and New Hampshire trading partners, Canada in particular. In response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on key allies and trading partners, Shaheen sponsored bipartisan legislation to require congressional approval of tariffs. Shaheen, a member of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, has also called on the Small Business Administration (SBA) to investigate the impact of the Trump administrationâ€™s tariff policies on American small businesses, and sent a letter to President Trump urging him to reconsider his tariff plan. Senator Shaheen has met with small businesses across New Hampshire about the fall out thatâ€™s been felt in the Granite State from the administrationâ€™s ongoing trade war.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That will cover beef, milk, pork, fruits, nuts, rice and legumes.The third prong of the plan is to help farm groups develop new export markets.â€œThis is a short-term solution to allow President Trump to work on long-term trade deals to benefit agriculture and the entire U.S. economy,â€? said Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.A first step toward one such trade deal apparently has taken place.

"Home Â» NationCHINA said yesterday that itâ€™s â€œfully preparedâ€? for a trade war with the United States.US President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration is set to impose additional tariffs on US$34 billion worth of goods from China from Friday, and has threatened successive waves of duties on up to US$450 billion in Chinese imports.China has vowed to retaliate with its own tariffs on US agricultural products and to take more â€œqualitativeâ€? measures if Trump escalates the conflict.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China is â€œfully prepared to take a package of necessary measuresâ€? to safeguard its national interests.US companies ranging from soybean farms to whiskey distilleries and automakers like Ford and Tesla could suffer if China ramps up retaliatory measures.China accuses Washington of protectionism, with China Mobile the latest to encounter obstacles in the US market. A US agency under the Department of Commerce recommended on Monday against giving operating licenses to Chinaâ€™s largest telecom carrier, citing national security risks.Lu called the warnings â€œunfounded speculation and an irrational clampdownâ€? stemming from a Cold War mentality.â€œWe hope the US will provide a level-playing field for Chinese companiesâ€™ investment and operation in the US and do something conducive to the mutual trust,â€? the spokesman said.Also yesterday, Chinaâ€™s central bank Governor Yi Gang said the yuanâ€™s 3 percent depreciation over the past two weeks reflects a strengthening of the US dollar and â€œthe effect of external uncertainties.â€?Despite that, Yi said financial risks were under control.â€œThe fundamentals of the Chinese economy at present are good,â€? he said. â€œThe Chinese economy has entered a phase of high-quality development, with a stable international balance of payment and generally balanced cross-border capital flow.â€?â€œOur country implements a floating exchange system consulting a basket of currencies and based on market supply and demand,â€? Yi said. â€œYears of practice have shown this system to be effective and must continue to be adhered to.â€?Yi said China will continue to adopt a prudent and neutral monetary policy and deepen the market-oriented reform of the yuanâ€™s exchange rate mechanism.Responding to questions over a safety warning to Chinese citizens traveling to the US issued by Chinaâ€™s embassy in Washington late last week, foreign ministryâ€™s Lu said the government was merely fulfilling its duty to warn travelers of â€œpotential dangers.â€?The warning to Chinese travelers noted the high cost of medical treatment in the US, the importance of guarding against crime and terrorist attacks, and the considerable powers wielded by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Does China have an ace up its sleeve in the trade war? It might, and it could ruin President Trumpâ€™s trade war. Hereâ€™s whyâ€¦by Jody Chudley of Daily ReckoningPresident Trump is clearly not afraid of confrontation, especially when he holds a distinct advantage.And right now, in his ever-escalating trade war with China, Trump clearly holds a distinct advantage.That advantage is that China sells a lot more stuff to the United States than the United States sells to China.In 2017, China exported $506 billion to the United States while the U.S. exported only $130 billion to China.1 That means that while China can levy tariffs on $130 billion of goods coming in from the United States, President Trump can slap tariffs on $506 billion worth of Chinese goods â€” hundreds of billions more.That isnâ€™t a fair fight.Before President Trump assumes victory however, there is another issue to considerâ€¦China Has A Heavy Metal Ace Up Its SleeveNeodymium, ytterbium, gadolinium, dysprosium, erbium, holmium, lutetium and promethium.Donâ€™t worry, my keyboard is working fine.Yes Iâ€™m still speaking English, and no, Iâ€™m not casting an evil spell on you.Those strange words that I typed are actually a list of rare earth metals. You probably havenâ€™t heard of them, but that isnâ€™t because they arenâ€™t important to you.In fact, these rare earth metals are very important to our entire country.Rare earth metals play a crucial role in the manufacturing of indispensable everyday consumer items like laptops, smartphones, wind turbines, flat screen televisions and electric car motors.Perhaps more important, they are also essential to our military since they are used in smart bombs, military radar, satellite communications, night vision goggles, armored vehicles and laser guidance systems.The United States produces none of these important metals.By none, I mean zero, zilch, nada.The U.S. imports 100 percent of the rare earth metals that it uses. And the country that has almost all of these metals is China â€” the very country that President Trump is aggressively targeting in a trade war.2All China needs to do is stop shipping these rare earth metals to the United States and we would have some big problems on our hands. A lack of rare earth metals would throw a massive wrench in our high-tech consumer production chain and also our militaryâ€™s access to advanced weapon system development.It would be a huge blow to both our economy and the strength of our military.When it comes to rare earth metals, China is the only game in town. And by town I mean the entire planetâ€¦And the Chinese already have a history of using this stranglehold to their advantage.In 2009, China and Japan had a little disagreement over two ships that collided in the controversial South China Sea. China responded by shutting off Japanâ€™s rare earth metal supply which promptly sent some metal prices surging more than 20 percent, while severely disrupting the supply chains of some of the worldâ€™s largest companies.3If China was willing to do that over a territorial dispute, it is hard to imagine that they wouldnâ€™t be willing to do in an all-out trade warâ€¦Getting Prepared To Profit From This SituationIf you find yourself thinking that being nearly 100 percent reliant on imports for such important commodities is a national security and economic policy concern, you wouldnâ€™t be alone. The fact that the 100 percent reliance is on one country which we happen to be engaging in a nasty trade war exacerbates the problem exponentially.You and I canâ€™t do anything to help fix this problem. However, we can get ourselves ready to make some money if China does decide to play this ace that itâ€™s hiding up its sleeve.China supplies almost 100 percent of these rare earth minerals to the United States. There are, however, some publicly traded companies that produce rare earth minerals as well.An ETF has been established to track those companies and give investors a way to â€œget longâ€? rare earth minerals. The ETF is called Market Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF (REMX), and it allows investors to own a basket of companies with rare earth exposure.REMX currently has 21 different positions in publicly traded companies spread across more than $150 million in investments. No single company represents more than 8.5 percent of the ETFâ€™s assets.If China decides to try and punish the United States by cutting off our rare earth minerals, the price of those minerals is going to skyrocket as speculators react by hoarding them. If that happens, I believe the group of companies owned by this ETF will be clear beneficiaries.I hope it doesnâ€™t come to that. But if it does, we now know what to do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"About $40 million in Utah beef and pork ends up in Chinese food each year.Thatâ€™s food in China, not Panda Express.The World Trade Center Utah has issued a report on what the effects would be of a protracted trade war with China. President Trump made trade concessions a cornerstone of his campaign, with China as the lead target. Now that heâ€™s followed up with specific proposals for tariffs on Chinese products, China has responded with tariff proposals of their own.Beef, pork, scrap aluminum and plastics are the Utah products that would be hardest hit if China follows through.About 20 percent of our beef exports go to China, and the tariffs could cost beef and pork producers dearly. That would be a hard hit for rural Utah, which has missed out on most of the growth powering the Wasatch Front.Other vulnerable industries are scrap aluminum companies, who sent 40 percent of their exports to China and Hong Kong last year, and plastic product exporters, who did $23 million in business in China.All told, the trade center estimates about $60 million in Utah business would be lost in a trade war with China. Total exports to China and Hong Kong from Utah are about $850 million annual, so $60 million would be a 7 percent loss.Whatâ€™s more, those producers also would see prices for their products drop as the market absorbs the portion that used to go to China. Other tariffs also would restrict new opportunities for Utah companies, the report said.Article continues belowOf course, it is still a trade war of words at this point. The president famously stakes out drastic positions as a negotiating strategy, and China has responded similarly. Trump doesnâ€™t help himself when he flips and then flops, as he did last week on the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement, but the threats against South Korean steel imports have led to concessions from Seoul.Ultimately, there always will be a need to negotiate trade rules with other nations, and every nation will make defensive moves to product their industries. Weâ€™re still in the posturing stage. When the dust settles, the tariffs may disappear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Â© AP Photo/ Andy WongIf a trade war is escalated by the US, the Chinese authorities will take all necessary measures to minimize the losses for Chinese companies and individuals. Nonetheless, the US, the world's largest economy with a GDP of approximately $19 trillion, has less endurance for a full-blown trade war.China does not want a trade war with the US, which is one of its most important trade partners. But if US President Donald Trump starts a trade war, China will fight to the end to defend its interests.If unfair action is taken by the US, China has various tools to use as countermeasures. Meanwhile, China is expected to be fully prepared for the escalation of trade friction by strengthening its ability to safeguard Chinese entities targeted by the US.In an all-out trade war, offense and defense are equally important to winning.The Trump administration said it will impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports ranging from industrial robots and electric vehicles to locomotives and jet engines. If this measure is carried out,Behind the trade dispute is the US concern over the 'Made in China 2025' program, which aims to upgrade China into a manufacturing superpower.However, Trump's efforts will be in vain.Export-promoting subsidies are just one of many options for China to use in tackling a trade dispute with the US. China's strong mobilization capability will help the government to defend the nation's own interests.The situation is different in the case of the US, however.While it is hard to win a trade war with punitive tariffs, it is more difficult to protect people from feeling pain in the fight.In the US, some interest groups such as steel companies benefit far more than others from trade protectionism, while the trade disputes potentially hurt exports of US farm products.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The most intense part of the trade war is with China however.US President Donald Trump has proposed a mutual cancellation of 'all tariffs, barriers and subsidies' in trade with the European Union in order to provide 'fair trade'. He is due to conduct business negotiations with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday.'The European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade. I have an idea for them. Both the US and the USHope they do, we are ready - but they will not!' Trump said from his Twitter account.US House Speaker Paul Ryan told a news conference he hoped current trade tensions between the United States and the European Union would result in a mutual reduction of trade barriers.Trade relations between the EU and the US have been strained since Trump imposed high tariffs on steel and aluminum imports against dozens of countries, including Europe's bloc, in June. The European Union has imposed its own barriers on US products in response.During his presidential campaign,EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom and Japan's Economy Minister Hiroshige Seko met in Brussels back in March for preliminary talks before receiving US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer - a follower of the 'America's First' mantra.Initially, the meeting aimed to discuss China's oversupply of steel, but after Trump's announcement, the meeting became a crisis cabinet.'We are looking for a bit more clarity about the process than what happens in the US,' a European Union official said on condition of anonymity to the AFP news agency back in March.'There are few expectations of any solution today, but maybe we can get an idea of ??how we can get to one,' the source added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Â© Tang Ming Tung / Getty ImagesChina's government is reportedly planning to curb the average tariff rates on imports from most of its trading partners as soon as October in an attempt to bring down consumer costs amid growing trade tensions with the US.The ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies has intensified over recent weeks after Washington introduced a new wave of tariffs, targeting $200 billion in Chinese imports.Cutting export duties for China's other trading partners is aimed at boosting domestic consumption, which is expected to bolster the slowing economy, according to people familiar with the issue, as quoted by Bloomberg. The move comes months after China reduced tariffs on a wide range of consumer goods.China still charges a higher average tariff on imports compared to other developed economiesMFN is a level of treatment awarded by one state to another in international trade. Along with the principle of national treatment, MFN is one of the cornerstones of WTO trade law.President Trump advocated more reciprocal and 'fairer' trade relations with China throughout his election campaign in 2016. Trump had repeatedly slammed Chinese companies for alleged theft of US intellectual property and accused Beijing of unfairly subsidizing them.Li stressed that Beijing wouldn't devalue the yuan to boost Chinese exports amid the trade war.'We must uphold multilateralism, the rules of free trade,' the Premier Li said in a speech to a World Economic Forum event.

"Â© Kim Kyung Hoon / ReutersDeveloping Asia is expected to lose steam as trade rows between Washington and Beijing drastically damage supply chains for businesses, dragging down the region's export-reliant economies, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) says.The Manila-based institution has lowered its 2019 growth forecast for both China and developing Asian nations by 0.1 percentage points, citing major risks posed to international trade and global financial markets by the country's ongoing trade dispute with the US. A tightening in global liquidity is expected to have a negative impact on business activity through a potential rise in borrowing costs and higher risks of capital outflows, according to the ADB.Yasuyuki Sawada, the chief economist at the development bank, said 'The biggest risk to continued growth comes from the disruption of international production linkages caused by a further escalation of trade tensions,,' the analyst added.The ADB's forecasted growth of 5.8 percent would be the lowest for Asia and the Pacific since 2001, when it expanded 4.9 percent.

"The Trump administrationâ€™s decision to impose 10% tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese importsâ€”and Chinaâ€™s subsequent retaliation on $60 billion of U.S. productsâ€”deepens and prolongs the trade war between the two countries, posing even more adverse consequences for American soybean farmers, the American Soybean Association says.â€œIf this trade war is not resolved soon, we will see irreversible consequences,â€? said Davie Stephens, a soybean grower from Clinton, Kentucky, and ASA vice president. â€œBeyond very real concerns about a continued price drop for our beans, weâ€™re talking about the viability of our long-term relationship with the China market. We need negotiations now rather than tit-for-tat responses that hurt both countries.â€?Since June, the price of U.S. soybeans at export terminals in New Orleans has dropped 20%, from $10.89 to $8.68 per bushel. Farm-gate prices have fallen even further. During the same period, the premium paid for Brazilian soybeans has increased from virtually zero to $2.18 per bushel, or $80 per metric ton.China has pursued new means to procure soybeans and other protein crops, including maximizing soybean imports from other exporting countries, particularly Brazil.â€œWith the situation worsening, these decisions could become long-term policies. Even if the administration achieves its goal of changing Chinaâ€™s policies on forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft, which could end the tariff war, this trend could be irreversible. U.S. soybean farmers may become the supplier of last resort to what has been, by far, our most important foreign market,â€? Stephens said.U.S. soybean producers have spent more than 40 years and millions of farmer dollars building the China market for soy and livestock products.â€œWe had a lot of opposition,â€? said James Lee Adams, a soybean producer from Camilla, Georgia, who was ASA president in 1989 when market development efforts in China were in full swing. â€œPeople thought we were throwing money away, but we kept investing despite the pressure to cut our losses. It took many years, but we prevailed, and today, China is a $14 billion market for U.S. beans. This trade war is of grave concern because it could wipe out all those years of work. Knowing the difficulties we faced, we know how hard it will be to get this market back.â€?Some trade analysts say it will be impossible for China to find enough soybeans and other protein feeds from other sources, and that it will continue to depend on the U.S. for a significant amount of its imports. But even if the U.S. keeps half of its soybean market in China, the value of exports due to lower prices will fall to an estimated $5.6 billion from the $14 billion sold in 2017. In the absence of other expanded and new markets, the outlook is for continued low prices and declining U.S. soybean production for years to come.ASA has consistently opposed using tariffs to pursue the administrationâ€™s trade objectives, and has called for the Section 301 tariffs to be rescinded.â€œRecognizing the long-term impact of Chinaâ€™s soybean tariff on our exports, we have implored the administration to finalize NAFTA, including Canada, reconsider joining TPP and, if not, negotiate bilateral trade agreements with TPP countries, including Japan and Vietnam, and with other countries where soy and livestock product exports could be expanded, including Indonesia and the Philippines,â€? said Ryan Findlay, CEO of ASA.â€œWe are also asking the administration and Congress to double funding for the Foreign Market Development and Market Access Programs for export promotion activities,â€? Findlay said. â€œWhile the additional cost of $2.35 billion over ten years canâ€™t be covered under the 2018 Farm Bill, revenues collected by the Treasury from the administrationâ€™s Section 232 and 301 tariffs already more than meet this funding level. Another use of these revenues if the tariffs remain in place and additional revenues are collected would be to fund the $8 billion in inland waterway improvements needed to upgrade the competitiveness of U.S. agricultural exports in future years.â€?â€œWe need these market opening and competitiveness measures to help offset the expected long-term negative impact of Chinaâ€™s soybean tariff on the livelihoods of U.S. soybean farmers,â€? Findlay said.Source: American Soybean Association",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Businesses that will suffer as a result of the trade war between the US and China will get help, Hong Kong Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau said yesterday, noting that the government has in place some financing schemes to assist small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) should the need arise.He said there are additional measures by the Hong Kong Export Credit Insurance Corporation to insure exporters and to manage some of the risks of tit-for-tat tariffs.Mr Yau was speaking after the fourth meeting with key stakeholders in Hong Kong, including SMEs, associations, semi-government bodies such as the Trade Development Council and the Hong Kong Export Credit Insurance Corporation on the possible fallout from the trade fight between the US and China.On July 6, the United States imposed a 25 per cent tariff on US$34 billion (S$46 billion) worth of Chinese goods, which led to China raising tariffs on over 100 imports from the US. This was on top of the steel and aluminium duties that were already in effect.On July 10, the White House released a list of 10 per cent tariffs on US$200 billion in Chinese goods, following through on President Donald Trump's threat of additional punitive measures.Mr Yau said the total impact of both rounds of tariffs will be felt on HK$130 billion (S$23 billion) worth of goods, which is about half of the total value of goods exported from China to the US via Hong Kong and makes up 2.2 per cent of the city's total exports.While no company has felt the effects of the trade war so far, he said, trade members are anxious and particularly concerned about how businesses would fare in the later half of the year.While no company has felt the effects of the trade war so far, Mr Edward Yau said, trade members are anxious and particularly concerned about how businesses would fare in the later half of the year.He noted that higher tariffs on goods would be added cost to businesses and this cost 'would have to be passed on either to the production side or to the consumer side'.'In any case, Hong Kong as a major trading centre, we will easily be hard hit in the forefront so we need to be very vigilant on that,' he added.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, Mr Jimmy Kwok, said the tariffs could lead to a 10 per cent rise in business costs, most of which would be passed on to US consumers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'This will have an indubitably large impact on other countries.'US President Donald Trump said on Monday he will slap new tariffs on US$200 billion (S$274 billion) worth of Chinese goods - on top of another US$50 billion that was targeted earlier. The new goods will be taxed 10 per cent more from next Monday, and this will be raised to 25 per cent from January next year unless both sides strike a deal.China said it will not stand idly by and will respond in kind, even if Mr Trump has threatened tariffs on another US$267 billion in imports. US-China trade talks, which were set to take place next week, are reportedly in doubt.The latest development will also delay trade talks between Japan's Economic Revitalisation Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, which was slated for Friday (Sept 21). This is so that Tokyo can assess the impact of the latest round of tariffs, Reuters news agency reported citing a government source.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Mr Trump, meanwhile, are also set to meet next week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session in New York.Related Story Japan calls for early solution to US-China trade warRelated Story China's arsenal in US tariff row shrinks but it has other weaponsMr Trump has slammed Japan for exploitation as he cited Washington's US$68.9 billion trade deficit last year with the world's third largest economy.Japan is fending off demands for a bilateral trade deal in the hopes of persuading the US to rejoin the multilateral Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.In May, Japan told the World Trade Organisation that it reserved the right to take retaliatory measures on 50 billion yen (S$611 million) of American goods. A month later, the US exempted certain Japanese products from steel tariffs of 25 per cent, though it is still threatening duties on imported Japanese cars and parts.'Promoting global trade and investment will be key to developing the global economy,' Mr Motegi said on Tuesday. 'No country wants to be in the position of having to impose tit-for-tat tariffs.'Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Hiroshige Seko also said that the decision to impose additional tariffs was 'extremely regrettable'.'Given how complex and intertwined the global supply chain is, there may be adverse spillover effects in other parts of the world,' he said, noting that many Japanese businesses are exporting parts to China, where these are then made into products that are exported to the US.There are some 32,000 Japanese firms in China, the Foreign Ministry said.Rand Corporation policy analyst Ali Wyne said in an opinion piece on Kyodo News that Japan must prepare for the prospect that such economic competition might spill over into the security domain, especially in the region.'Because trade interdependence is one of the few phenomena that have compelled the two countries to exercise mutual restraint, the weakening of that dynamic could lead Beijing to challenge US national interests more forcefully,' he said, noting that China could undercut Washington's sanctions campaign against North Korea or be more assertive in the South China Sea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BANGKOK - China is serious about liberalising its economy and its pace of doing so has been accelerated by its trade war with the United States, says Chinese economist and government adviser Fan Gang.'That kind of willingness is genuineâ€¦ China recognises that it needs more liberalisation to become more competitive in the global market,' said the Peking University professor and president of Shenzhen-based think-tank China Development Institute.But the pace of reforms has been hampered by what he called 'vast interest groups' lobbying Beijing against lifting the protection for local firms that it has maintained for years as a developing country.'China should move on. You have more and more companies operating internationally and enjoying international terms for competition. Why do you still have those protections?... More and more companies don't need it,' Professor Fan said, referring to Chinese companies like mobile phone maker Huawei.'Previously, China's pressure came from the top. The policymakers put pressure on the localities, on the companies, to push them to change,' he said. Now, 'some outside pressure may serve as a good push'.Prof Fan was speaking to The Straits Times on Tuesday (Oct 30) on the sidelines of the Forbes Global CEO Conference in Bangkok.Global stock markets have taken a bumpy ride this year after US President Donald Trump triggered a trade war between the world's two largest economies, accusing China of stealing intellectual property and unfair trade barriers.Related Story China Q3 GDP growth seen hitting lowest since 2009 on trade war tollA series of tit-for-tat measures has resulted in more than US$250 billion (S$346 billion) worth of Chinese goods subject to tariffs of up to 25 per cent in the US, and some US$110 billion worth of US goods are subject to reciprocal taxes in China.Analysts expect the trade war to put a drag on global economic growth.Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G-20) summit in Buenos Aires next month.Mr Trump, while saying he expects to make a 'great deal' with China, has warned that he is ready to slap tariffs on even more products if a deal does not transpire.In the face of the trade war, China should focus on developing its own market rather than retaliation, said Prof Fan.'As long as you can really extend your market further, as long as you can attract more investment in your industrial supply chain, you can win,' he said.Asked if he was concerned that companies which export products to the US may relocate from China to third countries, Prof Fan said that was 'unavoidable'.The flip side of this is that companies targeting the Chinese market may be nudged to set up base within China to avoid the tariffs, he added.Given the complexity of modern supply chain networks, it is too early to say which country will ultimately prevail, he cautioned.'That depends on which market is growing fasterâ€¦ which becomes bigger,' he said. 'If the China market is growing faster and becomes bigger, China may not suffer too much.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SHANGHAI (BLOOMBERG) - The latest casualty of President Donald Trump's trade war? US$1 (S$1.38) yoga pants.Trump's order that the US Postal Service withdraw from an obscure 192-nation postal treaty threatens to hit American shoppers who have grown used to bargains on platforms such as EBay and Amazon.com.Because of the postal treaty, shipping the goods directly to consumers was relatively affordable. When the US pulls out, thousands of listings from China-based companies hawking dirt-cheap consumer goods will likely disappear.The treaty sets fees that national postal services charge to deliver mail and small packages from other countries, and gives poor and developing markets lower shipping rates than developed nations. The agreement - and another one that China and the US signed in 2011 - has essentially given Chinese merchants a US$170 million annual subsidy to ship products directly to American homes.'Chinese sellers on EBay and other platforms may disappear, or at the very least they will not find it so easy to sell to Americans anymore,' said Gary Huang, chairman of the supply chain committee for the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.'This has been a big advantage for them for many years and how they've beat out the American seller on their own turf.'US$1 YOGA PANTSThe postal loophole can be seen in the shipping options offered by Chinese EBay sellers and others on major e-commerce portals.Related Story Trump exits pact offering cheap foreign postal deliveriesRelated Story Trump has cleared deck for China trade war by striking new Nafta deal, say analystsOn Thursday (Oct 18), hundreds of EBay sellers from China advertised women's workout leggings, including ones for little as 76 cents that could be purchased instantly. The seller, China-based Webstainless, has racked up more than 21,680 positive reviews from buyers in the last 12 months, according to the e-commerce site. Webstainless offers free shipping to the US.On AliExpress, Internet giant Alibaba's e-commerce portal for international buyers, shipping is free if a pair of US$10.29 yoga pants are transported via ePacket, the name of the subsidised service by the US Postal Service. Other shipping options from companies like FedEx, United Parcel Service or DHL Worldwide Express range from US$40 to US$60, raising the cost of the cheap pants so much that a buyer might as well get them from a store or seller in the US.Trump's directive to eliminate the postal discounts could potentially raise costs for Alibaba, while helping FedEx and other international shipping companies.Any changes to international postal rates potentially disrupts cross-border e-commerce, the sale of goods from a retailer in one country directly to consumers in another. That business, enabled by platforms such as Amazon, EBay and Alibaba, is expected to reach US$1 trillion by 2020.Representatives for Alibaba did not respond to requests for comment. Alibaba rival JD.com's logistics arm said it was looking into the potential impact. Amazon and EBay, through spokespeople, said they were reviewing Trump's memo and declined to comment.The shipping rate under the postal treaty can be a fraction of what it costs to send the same item from the US to China - making returns very difficult - and it can be lower than what it costs to ship an identical product within the US.Amazon's prices illustrate the gap: standard shipping for an iPhone case from China to a New York address is US$4.99, while from a seller based in the US is $5.99. The difference may not seem like a lot, but added up over millions of low-cost consumer items, its effect has been a disadvantage for American retailers on e-commerce portals.'American sellers simply cannot compete,' said Huang, who's also founder of consultancy 80/20 Sourcing. 'It seems like Trump wants to level the playing field and one outcome is that American consumers will have less access to that really cheap stuff.'AMERICAN RETAILERS CHEERThe subsidised ePacket service limits packages to 2kg and less than US$400 value. Chinese sellers estimate shipping through the services take 10 to 20 days from China to the US.American companies have cheered Trump's plan to withdraw. 'This outdated arrangement contributes significantly to the flood of counterfeit goods and dangerous drugs that enter the country from China,' Jay Timmons, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement.UPS, which along with other private couriers stands to gain if the subsidised service is removed, said that withdrawal was 'the right step.' Under the treaty's framework it takes a year for a country to withdraw, during which rates can be renegotiated.'It's been an unbalanced deal,' said McDavid Stoddard, a director at Beyond, a shopping app that connects foreign brands to Chinese consumers. 'The US Postal Service has been complaining about this for a while and we've always doubted the long-term viability of this channel.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Trump is mulling tariffs on imports of Chinese consumer technology. That could well backfire.The news: Bloomberg says that the presidentâ€™s new tariffs could be extended to hit imports to the US beyond aluminum and steel. That could include electronics, to â€œpunish Beijing for its alleged theft of intellectual property.â€?The impact: Gadfly notes that firms like Amazon and Apple, which build devices in China, may have to hike US prices if that happens. It may also push foreign firms to manufacture in America, and encourage China to impede sales of US hardware while pushing its own.Why it matters: Trump says a trade war is â€œeasyâ€? for America to win, but tech firms could struggle. The situation also heightens tech tensions already whipped to fever pitch by the US governmentâ€™s national security concerns about takeovers of American firms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CLOSE Pig farmer Jimmy Tosh is worried about the impact of a trade war on his earnings. He will get hit from the increased cost of steel when he is building new barns and the lower revenue on pork. Lacy Atkins / The TennesseanBuy Photo Hugo Sanchez tries to catch baby pigs to be vaccinated at a pig farm in Henry, Tenn., on Wednesday, April 11, 2018. (Photo: Lacy Atkins / The Tennessean)Buy PhotoHENRY, Tenn. â€” Jimmy Tosh, a third-generation farmer in this northwest Tennessee town, plans to add 30 new barns to raise pigs in and expand production for his family-owned farm that employs 380 individuals. His plans are less certain now as he looks at the increase in steel prices and a smaller market for pork â€” the results of a tariff confrontation with China.Rebar pricing has increased 17 percent since the steel tariff was announced, making the new barns more expensive, he said. With China the third largest market for U.S. pork, Tosh said he expects revenue to decline.'That is a market that is going to be hard to be replaced,' Tosh said, sitting in an office decorated with a pig clock and pig-themed pillows. 'If we have higher costs and lower revenues, that equals less profit. We'll have to rein in expansion.'More: How to watch Tuesday's Tennessee gubernatorial forum on rural issuesMore: U.S. Ag Secretary Sonny Perdue: Farmers aren't afraid of 'temporary pain' amid tariff debateMore: U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn worried about negative impact of Trump's tariff proposalTosh is among Tennessee farmers concerned about the tariff showdown underway between President Donald Trump and China. When Trump announced new tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, China retaliated with an up to 25 percent tariff on 128 U.S. products, including soybeans, pork, cotton, tobacco, beef and cars â€” each significant crops and products in Tennessee.The conflict could hurt manufacturers and farmers, said Tennessee Economic & Community Development Commissioner Bob Rolfe. He emphasized the strong relationship Tennessee has with China and in terms of recruiting companies to the state. Eighteen Chinese companies have Tennessee locations and 13 have expanded to the state since Gov. Bill Haslam took office in 2011. China is Tennesseeâ€™s third largest trade partner.â€œWeâ€™ve been very successful and been aggressive in recruiting not only Chinese companies but other companies across the globe to come to Tennessee,â€? Rolfe said. â€œThe primary concern remains that these tariffs are going to impact business decisions in Tennessee. When you start this tariff war, you are going to impact your cost of raw materials and then it impacts the price. Then it impacts hiring decisions and expansion decisions.''We are certainly not for a trade war'Trump's decision to impose steel and aluminum tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent, respectively, were an effort to protect those industries in the U.S. and to correct the country's large trade deficit. Since imposing the original steel and aluminum tariffs in March, Trump has threatened to expand their scope to an additional $100 billion in Chinese products.Rolfe said Tennessee exported $2.5 billion in goods to China last year, a 14 percent increase over 2016 totals, and imports $24 billion in goods from China, most of which was computer and communication equipment. He is not concerned by the imbalance, he said.â€œWe have a trading relationship,' he said. 'We are exporting and importing and yes, there is a big imbalance, but thatâ€™s not something we are focused on. â€¦ Maybe it resonates with those that don't really understand international trade policy and trading partnerships.â€?Rolfe said the tariff conflict is likely to give pause to Chinese companies considering expansions in the U.S. A trade war could disrupt job growth at a time when one-third of jobs created through Tennessee economic development incentives were from foreign direct investments and 80 percent were in manufacturing, an industry reliant on steel. With Tennessee increasingly becoming an automotive-centric state, the steel and aluminum tariffs will affect that sector.More: Electrolux halts $250 million project in Springfield after Trump's tariff announcementMore: Tennessee's huge auto industry: 7 things you may not knowElectrolux in Springfield announced in March it would halt plans for a $250 million expansion because of the steel tariffs.â€œWe are certainly not for a trade war,' Rolfe said. 'We are not for higher tariffs. These higher tariffs on both sides of the equation result in higher costs that are ultimately absorbed by the end consumer.'Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Jai Templeton said his department is actively seeking additional trade opportunities with other countries to cushion the impact of Chinese tariffs on Tennessee farmers.â€œInternational relations and trade are key factors to the continued success of agriculture in this state,â€? Templeton said. â€œMaintaining this critical trade partnership with China is extremely important.â€?China is one of Tennesseeâ€™s largest foreign markets for agricultural products, Templeton said.Of the nearly $1.5 billion in farm commodities produced in Tennessee in 2016, soybeans were the largest crop, at $422 million. Nearly $100 million was cotton, $78 million was tobacco, and $23 million was in pork.Tennessee Farm Bureau President Jeff Aiken said China represents 30 percent of the U.S. soybean market.â€œItâ€™s very concerning for Tennessee agriculture,â€? Aiken said. â€œMost farmers focus on providing food and fiber for the world and paying their bills and raising their families. Now, they are going to have the added burden of, are they going to have a market for their products? The long-term concern would be, if we lost those markets, do we ever regain them?â€?The flap over tariffs comes as farms struggle with margins. Farm income has decreased by 50 percent in the past four years, Aiken said. Access to foreign markets helps U.S. farmers and consumers.â€œThose markets help farmers remain in business,â€? Aiken said. â€œThey also help the prices of products the U.S. consumers pay for remain reasonably priced. ... If our farmers are forced out of business, where does our food come from?â€?Alan Meadows, a fifth-generation farmer in Halls, Tennessee, has 2,500 acres he farms with his father, and two-thirds of the farm consists of soybeans. He expects China to buy more from Brazil now that the tariffs are in place on U.S. soybeans.â€œOur margins are already pretty slim over the last two to three years because of the farm economy,' Meadows said. â€œThe China market is something we have worked, as the soybean association, for years to establish. The tariffs are putting my livelihood, so to speak, in jeopardy. We canâ€™t afford to lose our Chinese market.'Buy Photo Adam Walters, left, and his brother, Jeremy, work at Tosh Farms in Henry, Tenn., on Wednesday, April 11, 2018. (Photo: Lacy Atkins / The Tennessean)Trade war leaves farmer with uncertain expansion plansTosh Farms was built in 1913 by Jimmy Tosh's grandfather, but Jimmy Tosh is the one who began the pig operations. In 1994, there were five employees. Today, a staff of 380, plus about 200 contract farmers, produce 750,000 pigs in a year and farm 1,600 acres of row crops. The pigs are raised in long temperature-controlled barns, from wean to finish, and Tosh technicians make sure they are fed and healthy a few times each day.Tosh describes himself as a â€œfirm believerâ€? in free trade and doesnâ€™t see the trade deficit with China as a significant problem. He sees nothing positive coming from the tariff confrontations. While some industries have suffered because of Chinese manufacturing tactics, the nation should be focused on job training for them, not tariff wars.China is the third largest market for pork and also buys parts not used in the U.S.: pig feet, livers and hearts.Building barns will be more expensive with the steel and aluminum tariffs, along with upgrades for pickup trucks and tractors, he said. He said economists are forecasting the pork tariff will cost $6 to $8 a pig, a cost that climbs into the millions when 750,000 pigs are tallied.Jeremy Walters, who works with his brother, Adam Walters, at Tosh Farms, raises about 10,000 pigs as a contract farmer, in addition to working as a service manager. He said he often thinks about expanding his contract, but his individual expansion also will be affected by steel costs.'Iâ€™m not worried about my job here,' Jeremy Walters said. 'But if I wanted to build more barns, it may slow that. It may slow some future expansion.'Many of the red districts nationwide that voted for Trump rely heavily on agriculture and manufacturing, raising questions about how the tariffs will affect Trump's re-election hopes.Adam and Jeremy Walters said they voted for Trump mainly out of distaste for Hillary Clinton, not devotion to Trump. Adam Walters said whether the tariffs will influence his vote going forward will largely depend on the extent of their impact.'It would depend on how long it lasts, or if this tariff is just him moving some chips on the board, trying to get better leverage for something else,' Adam Walters said. 'I'd like to think there was a good reason for it.'Jeremy Walters acknowledged the possibility that the trade confrontation could dampen support from the base that propelled Trump into the presidency.'Thatâ€™s what got him in office, I guess, what you call the red-blooded Americans,' Jeremy Walters said. 'If the red-blooded Americans start to suffer, well ... .â€?For Tosh, a lifelong Republican, the tariffs are certain to affect his vote, he said.'Itâ€™s becoming much more difficult to be a Republican in this type of an environment,' he said.

"The stateâ€™s dominant ag products, valued at $18 billion, are in the crosshairs of retaliatory tariffs. Still, most farmers here are hesitant to criticize Trump.Russell Boening, a Texas farmer and rancher whoâ€™s also president of the Texas Farm Bureau, is starting to feel the effects of escalating trade conflicts between the United States and its trading partners, namely China. In response to tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum enacted by the Trump administration earlier this year, China has placed its own tariffs on a litany of U.S. farm products. One of those, grain sorghum, is a livestock feed grain Boening grows along with 4,500 other farms in Texas. Its price has dropped by 25 percent in the last two months, he said, prompting him to store the grain and pray that prices improve before he puts the crop on a suddenly limited market. â€œThis will be an extra cost, but as true optimists, we are hopeful that the market will improve,â€? Boening told the U.S. House Ways and Means trade subcommittee on Wednesday. â€œThere are many farmers and ranchers who are facing the same challenges with all the uncertainty over trade policy.â€?But Boening stopped short of blaming the Trump administration for the tight spot that he and other Texas farmers have been put in. Beyond sorghum, China and other U.S. trading partners have threatened or levied retaliatory tariffs on beef, wheat, corn, cotton and pork â€” all dominant Texas agriculture products valued together at approximately $18 billion. Instead of using Wednesdayâ€™s venue to criticize the president, Boening told Congress that farmers â€œmust commend President Trump for working to solve problems that have existed for decades,â€? pointing to Chinaâ€™s illegal crop subsidies that undercut the global market. He then implored the administration to take into account the fact that â€œthese decisions have the ability to greatly damage our livelihoods.â€?So far thatâ€™s been the party line, so to speak, of Texasâ€™ overwhelmingly Republican farmers and ranchers. A Texas cotton and sorghum farmer who exports nearly his entire harvest to China told the Dallas Morning News this month that he likes Trump, but â€œI donâ€™t think there has ever been a time when there is so much money on the line.â€? The Texas Farm Bureau didnâ€™t immediately respond to Observer questions on Thursday.â€œThere are many farmers and ranchers who are facing the same challenges with all the uncertainty over trade policy.â€?Even without the tariffs, the situation in U.S. farm country is growing more precarious every day. Net farm income has declined by half since 2013, and median farm incomes for 2018 are expected to dip to -$1,316, according to the USDA. In January, agriculture lenders predicted this year would see even more farmers filing for Chapter 12 bankruptcy.In that context, Wednesdayâ€™s hearing was especially notable. Along with Boening, the panel included a Washington State fruit farmer who grows half of the cherries the state ships to China; a Montana rancher and grain farmer; an economist for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and others. â€œThereâ€™s been very few issues in my career as a farmer that cause me to lose sleep, but this is one of them,â€? said Michelle Erickson-Jones, the Montana farmer, but she and others were careful not to attack the Trump administration directly.Republican members of the subcommittee took a similar tack: bemoaning the hardships borne by farmers as a result of retaliatory tariffs, but declining to lay the blame at the presidentâ€™s feet. â€œI know the administration didnâ€™t intend for U.S. agriculture to be harmed, but the damage is predictable,â€? said trade subcommittee chair Dave Reichert, a Republican from Washington. Dallas Congressman Kenny Marchant, the only Texas Republican on the subcommittee, did not speak during the three-hour hearing. Nor did Representative Lloyd Doggett, the stateâ€™s sole Democrat on the subcommittee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"â€œOnce China finds markets in South America, then they wonâ€™t come back and buy all the beans they bought before, all the corn they bought before, the pork, because they have other markets in place,â€? he said. â€œTheyâ€™re already investing in infrastructure in Brazil, they announced this year, so it looks like theyâ€™re digging in for the long run down there.â€?John Boyd, a Virginia farmer whoâ€™s also the founder and president of the National Black Farmers Association, foresees dire effects for small local farmers. Black-owned farms are almost entirely small-scale, with nearly 50 percent of black-operated farms under 50 acres, according to a 2012 census report. Only 1 percent of black-operated farms are over 1,000 acres. â€œThe tariffs will certainly run small-scale soybean farmers out of business,â€? Boyd said. â€œIt reduces local markets. If thereâ€™s nowhere for local markets to unload their grain elevators, then thereâ€™s going to be nowhere to sell your local commodities.â€? And the USDA, he says, has historically not been favorable to black farmers â€”something heâ€™s worried will keep the $12 billion aid package out of their reach. â€œGenerally, the big boys, the good old boys, they get in there and they know how to work the system and they make the system work for them, and they survive,â€? he said. â€œThis is a system that hasnâ€™t been user-friendly to black farmers. They deter them, and it just hasnâ€™t been a friendly process.â€?Boydâ€™s cash crop is soybeans. Heâ€™s already seen his projected profits take a hit, and heâ€™s nervous that if the trade war continues, the hits will just keep coming. â€œI donâ€™t want a handout, I want a hand-up, which is a free-market price for my commodity,â€? he said. â€œIâ€™m very nervous about what the outcome is going to be.â€?Not everyone is so concerned about the long-term effects of the trade war. Lynn Condreay is the general manager at a relatively small farmerâ€™s co-op in Lindsay, Nebraska, which handles about 2.5 million bushels of corn and soybeans. Lindsayâ€™s farmers werenâ€™t as affected by the soybean tariffs as other farmers, he said, because 80 percent to 90 percent of their beans had already been marketed to soybean-meal-processing plants in the state. And heâ€™s not worried about losing the Chinese export market for soybeans.â€œThey ainâ€™t got no place else to get them but us anyway, so theyâ€™re gonna have to buy them from us eventually,â€? Condreay said. China tends to go to South American markets first before coming to American farmers, he said, and the tariffs havenâ€™t changed the market pattern enough to be a cause for concern.Above all else, though, Condreay isnâ€™t worried about the tariffs or the aid, because heâ€™s confident that the trade war will have a long-term positive effect on agriculture. â€œBefore itâ€™s all said and done, I think itâ€™ll be a good thing. Itâ€™s something we should have done years ago, but evidently everybody else just dropped the ball on it,â€? he said. Trump â€œmight not get everything he wants, but if he gets part of what he wants, should work out pretty good. Thatâ€™s the way our customers all look at it, too.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When the US Secretary of State flies into Southeast Asia this week with a new investment pitch for the region, the response could be: thanks a million, but please stop threatening a trade war with China that will make us lose billions of dollars.Analysts say the $113 million of technology, energy and infrastructure initiatives trumpeted by Mike Pompeo earlier this week - the first concrete details of US President Donald Trump's vague 'Indo-Pacific' policy - may be hard to sell to countries that form an integral part of Chinese exporters' supply chains.It may even further inflame tensions with Beijing, which has been spreading money and influence across the region via its Belt and Road Initiative development scheme.â€œThe Southeast Asian capitals are more worried about any blowback effects for them of US-China trade tension than they are about how much they can benefit from this $113 million initiative,â€? said Malcolm Cook, senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.â€œPompeo has a hard selling job. There is still no real positive trade story for Asia coming out of the United States.â€?Hot on the heels of Washington's new economic plan for emerging Asia came reports the United States could more than double planned tariffs on $200 billion of imported Chinese goods from dog food to building materials. China called it â€œblackmailâ€? and vowed retaliation.After a brief meeting with new Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Kuala Lumpur, Pompeo will fly to Singapore - a global trading hub that could be one of the hardest-hit in the region by a trade war - for a sit-down with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) on Friday.Singapore's biggest bank, DBS, estimates that a full-scale trade war - defined as 15-25 percent tariffs on all products traded between the US and China - could more than halve Singapore's growth rate next year from a forecast 2.7 percent to 1.2 percent. Malaysia's growth rate in 2019 could fall from an estimated 5 percent to 3.7 percent.â€œWe are all acutely aware of the storm clouds of trade war,â€? Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said at the opening of an Asean foreign ministers meeting on Thursday that precedes meetings with the United States and other nations.Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said earlier this year that a trade war would have a â€œbig, negative impactâ€? on the country.Ratings agency Moody's said this week that an escalation of trade tensions in 2018 had become its â€œbaseline expectationâ€?, and that Asia was â€œespecially vulnerableâ€? given the integration of regional supply chains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) â€” Billionaire industrialist Charles Koch warned Sunday that Trump administration trade policies could trigger a recession.The conservative activist lashed out at the Republican president's brewing international trade war as hundreds of donors gathered for a private retreat in the Colorado mountains.Koch told reporters during a rare question-and-answer session that 'protectionism at any level' is 'detrimental.'Trump's approach could lead to a recession 'if it's severe enough,' he said.The administration has imposed billions of dollars of tariffs on Chinese and Canadian goods and threatened billions more on America's allies in Europe. The White House last week announced plans to send $12 billion in taxpayer dollars to U.S. farmers to help ease the economic fallout.The conservative Koch network, which has broken with Trump on immigration, government spending and trade, is promising to punish politicians in either party who support the tariffs.Asked to respond to Koch's remarks, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters cast Trump as 'a free trader.''He believes that the best way forward is for all countries to get rid of unfair practices and move toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies,' Walters said. 'However, until other countries move in that direction, stop engaging in unfair practices, and start playing by the rules, the President is going to take tough action.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"German Chancellor Angela Merkel speaks to President Donald Trump in front of other world leaders in Charlevoix, Canada, at the G-7 summit on June 9, 2018. The mainstream media and world leaders are blaming Trump for starting a trade war, where in reality all politicians are fighting to protect their special interest groups. (Jesco Denzel /Bundesregierung via Getty Images)Whose Trade War Is It Anyway?Everybody complains about Trump, but he wasnâ€™t the one who started itWar is aggression, often with the use of physical violence to conquer land, people, and power. Trade wars, though not quite as bad, also are aggressive in nature. Where two or more private parties want to transact freely, aggressive governments step in the way and prevent trade from happening with the threat of force.In 2018, most of the mainstream media and the establishment powers blame President Donald Trump and his administration for starting a trade war, whichâ€”like real warsâ€”can only produce losers on both sides. â€œHow Much Damage Will Trumpâ€™s Trade War Do?â€? read a headline in The Atlantic, and countless other articles and official statements say similar things.So the mainstream media and some politicians are pretending that trade was 100 percent free before Trump started to threaten the â€œfree tradersâ€? of China, the European Union (EU), Mexico, and Canada with tariffs. The media paints Washington as the aggressor in this trade war. Trump shot first.However, truth be told, this trade war did not start this year and certainly the United States isnâ€™t the biggest aggressor. In real war terms, the Americans are now starting to shoot back after being under siege for decades and the whole world is complaining about this act of self-defense.As Trump wrote in a tweet before meeting the EUâ€™s Jean Claude Juncker on July 25, he doesnâ€™t want a war, he just wants the other side to stop shelling the United States.â€œThe European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade. I have an idea for them. Both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies! That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade! Hope they do it, we are ready â€“ but they wonâ€™t!â€?When Did It Start, Who Started It?If we take the definition of a trade war as stopping trade with force, through tariffs, duties, taxes, regulations, and restrictions on foreign investments, no government is innocent. They are all aggressors vis Ã  vis the private sector, which would like to make win-win deals across the globe.As economist Faustino Ballve notes in his â€œEssentials of Economics,â€? â€œIn the market, the buyer as well as the seller gives less than he gets; otherwise no exchange would take place.â€? In the day and age of identity politics and rampant nationalism, itâ€™s hard to believe that this also goes for the global market where private players donâ€™t care much where the buyer or seller is from or how they look.And itâ€™s hard to keep track of which government started which tariff and kept it for how long. However, we can say for certain that with Chinaâ€™s ascent to the World Trade Organization (WTO), trade restrictions for Chinese goods worldwide were dramatically lowered while China was allowed to keep relatively high tariffs of around 10 percent on average.The Worst OffenderSo despite this pretty good deal, and also making some improvements, China has kept waging a trade war, restricting market access through force more than any other country involved in the current trade spats between the United States and the EU, or the United States and NAFTA. And this has been going on since 2001.It still has simple average tariffs of 10 percent compared to the United States of 3.4 percent according to the most recent WTO data. When weighted according to the most traded goods, China still has more than double the rate of the United States at 3.5 compared to 1.6 percent according to the World Bank.Of course, it doesnâ€™t stop at tariffs. China has used other methods of restricting the flow of trade and putting foreigners at a disadvantage.The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation calls this â€œinnovation mercantilismâ€?:â€œWhen China pursues innovation-mercantilist policies?such as the acquisition of foreign technology enterprises leveraged by nonmarket, government-backed funds; forced transfer of technology or intellectual property (IP); IP theft; abuse of antitrust/antimonopoly policy; denial or restrictions of foreign firmsâ€™ access to Chinese markets; development of China-only standards; massive subsidies for Chinese firms; refusing to allow access to key resources (e.g., rare earth elements) unless companies locate in China; or any number of other unfair trade practices?such policies directly threaten the health and very viability of American (and other foreign) enterprises.â€?According to the latest Enabling Trade Report by the World Economic Forum (WEF) from 2016, which takes some of these measures into account, China ranks 61 out of 136 nations for its role in enabling trade. The United States ranks 22nd with weighted average tariffs at the lowest point in the nationâ€™s history.So while far from perfect, the United States is much less aggressive than the trade war-waging nation of China. To come back to the real war analogy, all the Trump administration has done is say, â€œStop shooting or weâ€™ll shoot back.â€? The Trump administration never asked for favorable treatment, it merely asked for a level playing field especially with China. But the Chinese havenâ€™t stopped shooting so the Trump administration is now shooting back.Of course, like a real war, â€œshooting backâ€? and hitting Chinese goods with tariffs is costly. Existing supply chains will be disrupted, some American industries will be hurt, so will some consumers. Others will benefit.It is possible that tariffs are too crude a way to restore some way of equilibrium because centrally planning trade is as difficult as centrally planning other parts of the economy. However, it can be argued that following through with threats made in trade negotiations is the only way to stay credible and get the Chinese to stop shooting eventually.Why is the mainstream media silent on these acts of trade war committed by the Chinese government? Why doesnâ€™t it call on the Chinese to lower tariffs to U.S. levels? President Trump certainly wonâ€™t stand in the way of that.What About the Others?With NAFTA and the EU, it gets more complicated as both blocks donâ€™t wage their trade wars as fierce as China and generally, trade with the two blocks has been more equitable, although the United States has sizeable trade deficits with both the EU and Mexico.Itâ€™s important to note here that despite all the rhetoric about unfair trade, there are domestic factors also which can cause a country to become less competitive, and the United States has itself to blame for excessive taxation and regulation, which can also be the cause for trade deficits with more competitive countries.The EUâ€™s weighted average tariffs are the same as the United States at 1.6 percent and Canada, the United States, and Mexico scrapped most tariffs within NAFTA.But despite the headline elimination of tariffs, there are still issues within NAFTA. From 1994 to 2016, there have been 35 complaints by American companies against Canada under the NAFTA dispute resolution framework, 22 against Mexico, and 20 against the United States. So again it looks like the United States is the least aggressive of the warring parties.Although the issues are far less severe than with China, Canada and Mexico are also using force to gain an advantage in trade. Canada still has sky-high tariffs on agricultural products, for example, and subsidizes lumber companies with government resources to the detriment of American industry.Despite the high trade deficit with Mexico, it is the most peaceful of the lot. The Trump administration sees more issues with it being used by foreign and domestic companies to manufacture cheaply in Mexico and then export duty-free to the United States, as American and German companies do with cars for example. Mexico is more of a supplier and a base rather than an aggressive war party.Speaking about cars, the EU is the biggest aggressor, with tariffs of 10 percent on American car imports whereas EU carmakers can ship to the United States with a paltry 2.5 percent increase in prices.And although the average tariffs are roughly similar in the EU and the United States, the EU has passed more than 250 harmful trade interventions in every year since 2009, many of which target the United States, according to World Trade Alert. A good example are hundreds of billions in agricultural subsidies and a convoluted set of rules for the standardization of products, like specific sizes for the seats of commercial truck drivers, which make it harder for foreign producers to ship to the bloc without modifications.Letâ€™s Not PretendLetâ€™s not pretend the U.S. trading partners are interested in real free trade. Their elected or unelected representatives are more interested in benefiting their special interest groups than in genuine free trade in goods and services among private parties.And these representatives will intervene with force in the market, wage war against the market to achieve these objectives, in many instances more forceful and for a longer time than the United States.And letâ€™s not pretend that Trump has started to threaten our partners with tariffs because he is a fan of them in and of themselves. He uses them as a negotiating tool, as a threat to get the other parties to reduce their acts of aggression. Trump wants free tradeâ€”and peace. In the case of the EU, this strategy seems to have worked, although agreements to talk about and work toward lower tariffs frequently remain just that: work and talk.And although the EUâ€™s Juncker has made these important concessions to work towards lower tariffs excluding the sensitive auto sector, most of the other players donâ€™t look to be interested in real free trade. Otherwise, they would have committed to Donald Trumpâ€™s offer at the G7 summit in June to drop all tariffs to zeroâ€”for everybody.Views expressed in this article are the opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Epoch Times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the shadow of an escalating trade war, momentum is picking up to protect the World Trade Organization from turning irrelevant.The European Union will host trade ministers from the United States and Japan next month in Brussels, according to two officials with knowledge of the meeting.The gathering will be part of an effort to address Chinaâ€™s trade practices in a way that doesnâ€™t marginalize the WTO, said the officials, who asked not to be identified because preparations are private.The meeting will precede about 10 high-level confabs around the globe over the next year aimed at calming trade tensions.The push to reform the Geneva-based WTO has gained urgency since Donald Trump became president, with his administration showing open disdain for the multilateral trade body and Trump himself saying, â€œThe WTO is unfair to U.S.â€?The EU is working on a proposal to amend the composition of the WTO as well as address about a half-dozen American complaints.â€œThe situation is serious,â€? WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo told reporters last month in Geneva. â€œThere are many leaders in the world that already understand that we need to have negotiations, that we need to sit down and talk, that we need to find solutions.â€?The Trump administration â€” arguing that the WTO is incapable of addressing the problems created by Chinaâ€™s rapid economic ascent â€” has resorted to unilateral tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods.Beijing has retaliated in kind with duties on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods and pledged to respond if Trump follows through with his threat of levies on an additional $200 billion of Chinese products.Washington, D.C.â€™s decision to sidestep the WTO has raised concern that the trade body could slide into obsolescence if steps arenâ€™t taken to shore it up.In May â€” a day after French President Emmanuel Macron proposed negotiations to reform the WTO â€” the United States, the EU and Japan met in Paris and reiterated their concern with some non-market-oriented measure of some partners.The trilateral group issued a joint statement citing the need to address â€œthe trade-distorting policies of third countries.â€?In addition to the Brussels meeting next month, the EU soon will unveil a plan to reform the WTO, seeking to make negotiations more flexible, reduce trade costs, make the dispute-settlement system more transparent, and to strengthen the trade body itself, according to a draft proposal seen by Bloomberg.Changing the WTO as well as addressing Chinese trade abuses will be discussed at a host of meetings around the world over the next year, including an October gathering in Ottawa of about a dozen trade ministers.The topics also will be raised at a high-level Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Papua New Guinea in November; in December, leaders from the Group of 20 economies will bring up reform in Buenos Aires; Macron proposed discussions this fall in Paris; and there will be a ministerial meeting on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The trade fight between the worldâ€™s two economic titans is about to make dozens of household goods more expensive for U.S. shoppers while thousands of miles away in China, consumers appear set to escape much of the pain.President Donald Trump is said to be intending to pull the trigger on tariffs targeting $200 billion of Chinese imports now that a midnight Thursday deadline for public input has passed. Such a move â€” his biggest salvo in the fight with China so far â€” also hits at the heart of the American household, risking price increases for everyday items from refrigerators and freezers to cutlery and towels.â€œIt seems unlikely the tariffs are not implemented as the U.S. administration believes that they are winning the trade war and will be in a stronger position to negotiate if they put more pressure on China,â€? JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note.Beijing has vowed to retaliate. But the targets it has selected â€” and the fact Chinaâ€™s imports of U.S.-made goods are dwarfed by what it exports â€” means the worldâ€™s biggest consumer market will be largely shielded from the spat.The countryâ€™s counterpunch tariffs on $60 billion of imports from the United States focus on manufacturing components, chemicals and medical instruments. And many of the ready-to-buy American goods that will be subject to duties by the Chinese government are hardly mass-market: yachts, riding crops and wigs.â€œMostly, itâ€™s going to be absorbed by Chinese corporates instead of consumers,â€? said Larry Hu, a Hong Kong-based economist at Macquarie Securities Ltd. â€œAt the bottom line, the direct impact is very small.â€?The differing lists of tariffs drawn up by the United States and China reflect the trade imbalances between the two nations: U.S. imports from China were about $505 billion in 2017, much of it electronic goods, household furnishings and clothing. But only $130 billion of products â€” including soybeans, aircraft, machinery and plastics â€” went the other way, reflecting Chinaâ€™s role as a manufacturing base, U.S. figures show.New data out Wednesday showed the U.S. goods deficit with China in the seven months through July this year widened about 8 percent to $234 billion from the same period in 2017.That trade-flow mismatch is helping President Xi Jinping protect Chinese consumers from the conflict, partly because he has comparatively fewer U.S. imports to tax. But if Trump follows through with tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports, it will be tough for American households to emerge unscathed.To be sure, Chinese consumers may see some less direct fallout, through the cost of food.In July, China slapped retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. agricultural products including soybeans, corn and sorghum, used to feed pigs in the worldâ€™s biggest pork-producing nation.The combination of those levies on $50 billion of imports from the United States, and the $60 billion under consideration now, could ultimately inflate shopping bills if manufacturers and producers pass the costs on to customers, according to Morgan Stanley economists. The bump to consumer prices could be 0.3 percentage points, they said in a Sept. 3 report. That said, China has indicated it will just source its pig feed elsewhere.Chinaâ€™s plans for tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods includes an additional 5 percent on U.S. products including planes and dairy machinery, and another 10 percent on items including wigs and textiles. Thereâ€™s an extra 20 percent on some chemicals and paper, and an additional 25 percent on products such as meat and wheat.But beyond these tariffs, China canâ€™t match Trumpâ€™s threats dollar for dollar. The government would have to retaliate in other ways, such as increasing regulation of U.S. companies in China â€” measures that donâ€™t directly put the consumer in the firing line but make it harder for U.S. companies to conduct business there.Reuters contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jean-Jacques Ruest takes the helm at Canadian National Railway Co. amid a tariff war that threatens to dampen economic growth and hamper the flow of goods.Mr. Ruest said a lengthy trade war could damage CN and the broader economy, but much of the companyâ€™s business can withstand higher tariffs on goods between the United States, Canada, Europe and China.â€œShort-term, this whole trade thing for CN is really not material. Itâ€™s a question of whatâ€™s next,â€? said Mr. Ruest, 63, who was named chief executive officer of Canadaâ€™s largest railway on Tuesday, after serving as interim leader since the March departure of Luc Jobin.Story continues below advertisementThe U.S. move to tax imports of steel and aluminum from Canada, Mexico and the European Union in addition to some Chinese goods has been met with reciprocal tariffs. Amid doubts over the future of the North American free-trade agreement (NAFTA), U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to impose a 25-per-cent tariff on autos.In an interview from Montreal, Mr. Ruest said Canadian lumber shipments to the United States continue to rise despite tariffs and CNâ€™s aluminum customer in Quebec and B.C. wants to boost rail shipments to U.S. markets, moving away from trucks and barges.The 25-per-cent steel tariff has negative and positive effects on CN and its customers. While Ontario steel producers could suffer as they lose access to U.S. markets, CNâ€™s biggest steel customer in the United States, US Steel, stands to gain from a protected market.As for U.S. threats to tax Ontario auto imports and the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by China and the United States, â€œweâ€™ll see how these things play out.â€? He said he is encouraged by news on Wednesday that the United States and the European Union were working on a trade deal, and said CNâ€™s Halifax and Montreal port operations are well positioned to take part in the trade.Mr. Jobin left in March, when much of the North American rail industry faced service complaints from customers and pointed questions from government about congested railways and a rail car shortage.Since then, Mr. Ruest has led CNâ€™s push to expand rail yards and add track, crews and rolling stock in a $3.5-billion strategy to reclaim the railwayâ€™s reputation as North Americaâ€™s best-run carrier.CN on Tuesday showed the effort is paying off, posting a 27-per-cent rise in profit and raising its expected earnings growth for the rest of the year.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementChristian Wetherbee, a stock analyst at Citigroup Inc., called the turnaround â€œshocking.â€?â€œThese guys started to deteriorate in the fall of last year and things got pretty ugly over the course of the winter. Clearly weather had an impact, but the improvement from [the first quarter to the second quarter] was pretty remarkable,â€? Mr. Wetherbee said by phone from New York. â€œYouâ€™ve got to give them credit. They spent a lot of time and effort and some money focused on improving operations. They did it quicker than a lot of people expected, including me.â€?Mr. Wetherbee said Mr. Ruestâ€™s experience in marketing will aid his efforts to restore service and add freight capacity across the companyâ€™s 32,000-kilometre network.â€œHe was in sales for a long time, which brings with it a certain perspective, but not one thatâ€™s all that different than the one theyâ€™ve been employing since Luc [Jobin] left,â€? Mr. Wetherbee said. â€œI feel like what weâ€™ve seen over the past several months is what weâ€™re going to get.â€?But uncertainty over new tariffs and trade disputes is a â€œpotential riskâ€? to CN, said Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank of Canada.About one-third of CNâ€™s sales are in cross-border shipments. CNâ€™s biggest business by revenue is moving cargo boxes of consumer and industrial goods, and other products. Much of CNâ€™s container business moves through the West Coast ports of Vancouver and Prince Rupert, to and from Asia. Petroleum and chemicals are its second-biggest category, followed by grain and fertilizer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"U.S. crude hit its highest level since 2014 on Monday amid rising concerns that Venezuelaâ€™s oil output could fall further following the countryâ€™s presidential election and potential sanctions on the OPEC-member nation.Prices firmed further as U.S. President Donald Trump had discussions with Russia and China about issuing new debt to Venezuela. Trump signed an executive order on Monday restricting Venezuelaâ€™s ability to liquidate state assets, a senior administration official told reporters.Any restriction on Venezuelaâ€™s financing, logistics or power supply could further depress the countryâ€™s crude output.Story continues below advertisementâ€œItâ€™s been going down for a bit, but there is an expectation that the decline will accelerate,â€? said Jamie Webster, senior director of the Center for Energy Impact at the Boston Consulting Group. â€œThereâ€™s increasingly a view that this could be as bad as Libya was in its worst days â€“ that production could fall to a very small per cent of what it is capable of doing.â€?U.S. crude futures settled 96 cents, or 1.4 per cent, firmer at $72.24 a barrel, after touching $72.33, the highest since November 2014. In post-settlement trade, the benchmark hit a fresh 3-1/2 year high at 72.59.Brent crude futures gained 71 cents, or 0.9 per cent, to settle at $79.22 a barrel. In post-settlement trade, the global benchmark rallied to $79.59, up more than a dollar from the previous close.Venezuelaâ€™s socialist President Nicolas Maduro faced widespread international condemnation on Monday after his re-election in a weekend vote his critics denounced as a farce cementing autocracy in the crisis-stricken oil producer.The United States is actively considering oil sanctions on Venezuela, where output has dropped by a third in two years to its lowest in decades. â€œThe spectre of U.S. oil sanctions on the embattled Latin American producer now looms large as Washington strives to tighten the financial noose,â€? PVM Oil Associates strategist Stephen Brennock said in a note.Brent pushed past $80 a barrel last week for the first time since 2014, and the market may again try to clear that hurdle, said Gene McGillian, vice president of research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.â€œIt seems as if the pull backs are just short-term profit taking and we will see whether people are going to be willing to drive the market through $80 again,â€? he said.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementBeyond Venezuelaâ€™s production woes, geopolitical concerns that U.S. sanctions on Iran could curb the countryâ€™s crude exports have led prices to trade higher in recent weeks.Additionally, a possible U.S. trade war with China is â€œon holdâ€? after the worldâ€™s two largest economies agreed to drop their tariff threats while they work on a wider trade agreement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday, giving global markets a lift in early Monday trade.Stabilizing trade relations between the countries could boost oil demand, Traditionâ€™s McGillian said.Rising output from U.S. shale and key OPEC producers could end the rally, BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters. Dudley said he expected a flood of U.S. shale and a possible reopening of OPEC taps to cool oil markets after crude rose above $80 a barrel last week.Dudley said he saw oil prices falling to between $50 and $65 because of surging shale output and OPECâ€™s capacity to boost production to cover a potential shortfall in Iranian supplies owing to U.S. sanctions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On Monday, when U.S. President Donald Trump held his second annual Made in America Product Showcase at the White House, there was no contradicting his assertion that American manufacturing has been on a roll. The United States has added more than 350,000 factory jobs since Mr. Trumpâ€™s election, with all the indirect economic spinoffs that implies.The mini-boom â€“ at 8 per cent, manufacturingâ€™s share of the U.S. economy is still only half what it was 20 years ago â€“ has provided Mr. Trump with precious cover as he accelerates a global trade war that may soon include a 25-per-cent tariff on foreign autos that would hit Canada hardest.Most â€œexpertsâ€? â€“ a class of people deeply distrusted by Mr. Trumpâ€™s base â€“ expect a trade war will eventually bring the economies of the United States and its trading partners to a crashing halt. But for now, working-class voters in the United States appear to solidly back Mr. Trumpâ€™s actions, providing him with an incentive to keep on venting.Story continues below advertisementâ€œDuring the campaign, they all said: â€˜Oh, youâ€™re never going to add manufacturing jobs. Thatâ€™s obsolete,â€™â€? Mr. Trump said at Mondayâ€™s event, which featured an F-35 fighter jet parked on the South Lawn. â€œI said: â€˜Itâ€™s obsolete? To make things is obsolete?â€™ I guess they were wrong.â€?To be sure, evidence of the downside of Mr. Trumpâ€™s trade war is emerging by the day. Iowa soybean farmers have seen prices slump since China slapped retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products. (The Trump administration announced a US$12-billion agricultural aid package on Tuesday to help farmers through the trade war.) And some U.S. factories have seen input prices spike since Mr. Trump imposed 25-per-cent and 10-per-cent tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, respectively.But even among workers in U.S. industries most threatened by a trade war, support for the Presidentâ€™s actions remains solid. His message that the United States â€œhas been taken advantage of for too longâ€? resonates on the factory floor. Thatâ€™s why all the expert opinion, pressure from Congress or pleas from U.S. business groups will not persuade Mr. Trump to back down.Nor, apparently, will fact-checking by those who seek to call Mr. Trump to account. On Monday, Mr. Trump again repeated his claim that U.S. Steel Corp. â€œis opening up six plants,â€? even though it is not true. But those who harp on the Presidentâ€™s distortions of the truth miss the point. They may think theyâ€™re waging the good war in tweeting out the Presidentâ€™s â€œlies.â€? But while Mr. Trump rarely gets the details right, his supporters believe he is broadly correct.U.S. Steel is, in fact, adding hundreds of jobs to its work force. On Thursday, Mr. Trump is expected to tour one of the companyâ€™s facilities in Granite City, Ill., where it recently restarted blast furnaces that were closed in 2015. U.S. Steel chief executive officer David Burritt, who has been singing Mr. Trumpâ€™s praises, has said he expects to add 800 jobs at the plant this year.U.S. public opinion overall is still largely pro-trade. But favourable attitudes toward existing trade agreements have been declining. And Republican voters seem willing to trust the Presidentâ€™s instincts on this issue. As a Pew Research Center poll taken in early July, a month after tariffs hit Canadian and European steel, showed, fully 73 per cent of Republican voters said Mr. Trumpâ€™s trade actions will be â€œgood for the U.S.â€? Among Democratic voters, who tend to oppose Mr. Trump across the board, fully 77 per cent said the tariffs would be â€œbadâ€? for the United States.So, while Republicans in Congress continue (for now) to champion trade agreements, it appears Mr. Trumpâ€™s election has transformed voter attitudes on the trade file. The Democratic Party, whose base once consisted of factory workers in Rust Belt states and social conservatives in the South, is now the party of the educated classes that favours free trade and globalization.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementWhile this shift began a while ago â€“ then-president Bill Clintonâ€™s signature of the North American free-trade agreement and support for Chinaâ€™s entry into the World Trade Organization started it â€“ the partisan role reversal on trade is perhaps the defining characteristic of the Trump era, explaining his success in 2016 in Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. While organized labour still backs Democrats, white working-class voters line up behind Mr. Trump.A Wall Street Journal/NBC news poll on Monday pegged Mr. Trumpâ€™s approval rating at 45 per cent, the highest level of his presidency. The survey, completed in part after Mr. Trumpâ€™s meeting last week with Russian President Vladimir Putin, shows that Mr. Trumpâ€™s base is intact and as solidly behind him as it was in 2016. Which is why, this trade war may just be starting.As he tweeted on Tuesday, this President honestly seems to believe: â€œTariffs are the greatest!â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Open this photo in gallery Larry Fink, chief executive officer of BlackRock, takes part in the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit in New York on Feb. 8, 2017. Lucas Jackson/ReutersBlackRock Inc. chief executive officer Larry Fink said that intensifying global trade tensions may spur a broad market downturn and a slowdown in the U.S. economy.Stocks could drop 10 per cent to 15 per cent and U.S. gross domestic product would start slowing in 2019 if the Trump administration sees through its threat to levy tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese imports, Fink said, adding that would elevate the current tensions to a full-blown trade war.â€œThe marketâ€™s having a hard time digesting the whole change in globalization and trade,â€? Fink said in an interview Monday with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television. â€œThe foundations of international trade are being raised and being questioned.â€?Story continues below advertisementTrade worries are already causing investors to â€œpause,â€? he added, despite record deal-making and stock repurchases. That effect has been compounded by the fact that for the first time in a decade investors can earn a return by keeping money in cash.In the BTV interview, Fink also said he expects the yield curve to invert this year, yet he doesnâ€™t think it signals an imminent recession.The worldâ€™s largest asset manager is already seeing signs of investor skittishness. Earlier Monday, BlackRock reported that investors pulled $22.4 billion from its equity products in the second quarter. Inflows into its iShares products totalled $17.8 billion, the lowest since the second quarter of 2016. That was against a backdrop of muted investor flows in ETFs for the industry in general.Shares of BlackRock fell 1.5 per cent at 9:55 a.m. in New York. The stock is down 1.3 per cent this year though July 13.Some institutions also yanked money from equity markets to serve deal-making and share buybacks, Fink added in a separate interview Monday. No matter, BlackRock is built to withstand short-term market tremors because of its size and diverse product offerings, he said.â€œLetâ€™s be clear: over the years, BlackRock has modelled its business to have strong results in rising markets and declining markets,â€? he said. â€œNo firm has our composition,â€? he said, touting the companyâ€™s expansion in technology, cash management and alternative investments such as infrastructure. Spikes in volatility drive greater demand for its risk-monitoring technology Aladdin, according to Fink.BlackRockâ€™s total assets under management were about flat at $6.3 trillion as of June 30. The New York-based firm also reported total net inflows of $20 billion in the period. Overall, the company had a solid quarter with adjusted second-quarter earnings of $6.66 per share, topping analyst estimates of $6.55 per share. Revenue gained 11 per cent year-over-year.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementâ€œInvestors have become accustomed to iShares consistently delivering outsized growth relative to peers,â€?

"U.S. President Donald Trump promised Prime Minister Justin Trudeau he would not impose steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada. It happened not just once over the last few months but on three separate occasions, Canadian officials say.So much for presidential promises. So much for the idea that playing nice with the mercurial man works. Canada got slammed with the tariffs anyway. It didnâ€™t matter that the United States has a large surplus in steel trade with Canada. It didnâ€™t matter that the national security rationale for the tariffs, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rightly pointed out, is bogus. The attempts to be reasonable, to temper the retrograde Hoover-era protectionists in Washington failed.On their own, Mr. Trumpâ€™s steel and aluminum tariffs are serious enough. Ninety per cent of Canadaâ€™s steel exports go to the United States. But the reverberating impact, the potential collateral damage, is worse. The continent now appears headed for commercial turmoil. A brutal extended trade war is well possible.Story continues below advertisementThe Trudeau government couldnâ€™t sit idly by in the face of Mr. Trumpâ€™s aggression. Mr. Trudeau has played kid-gloves diplomat with nothing in return from this President for long enough. For self-respect and for economic justice, he had to hit back hard and his retaliatory measures are strong.Of the Americans, the Prime Minister said, â€œwe have to believe that at some point their common sense will prevail.â€?But with the Trump administration you can never count on common sense. Mr. Trump, whose protectionist views appear to have hardened lately, has another threat looming; the one to impose heavy duties on imports of automobiles and trucks. In the face of the Canadian retaliatory measures he could well move on them, dramatically heightening tensions.Thereâ€™s also the question of the fate of the NAFTA renegotiation. It was already on perilous ground with one deadline to present a new deal to Congress already missed. The steel tariff imbroglio could be the nail in the coffin. No deal is likely now before the election of a new Congress in the fall. The new Congress could have a Democratic majority thus necessitating a new beginning.In the meantime, given that the NAFTA renegotiation has not proceeded as he wished, Mr. Trump could well carry out his initial campaign threat to torpedo the accord.Canada, the United States and Mexico were close to an agreement on a new deal in the auto trade sector which was a high Trump priority. Washington and Ottawa, officials say, had things quite well worked out but U.S. and Mexican negotiators couldnâ€™t come to terms. Mexican elections are a month away and thereâ€™s a good possibility that a new government with different trade priorities could be in place.The negotiating dynamic has placed Ottawa in a hostage-like position to Mr. Trumpâ€™s whims and to decisions in Mexico. The latter are where Mr. Trumpâ€™s bigger issues lie. Canada and the United States however are still far apart on several other NAFTA issues. In meetings with Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland this week, U.S. Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer was insistent on a sunset clause for any new NAFTA deal, a proposal Ottawa strongly opposes.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementWith the steel dispute eruption and NAFTA on the ropes, the prospect of an eventual scenario in which a new bilateral trade pact has to be worked out with Ottawa and Washington heightens.Lumping trade in with national security has given Mr. Trump a cover for his hostile actions. It also brings the administrationâ€™s new superhawk, national security adviser John Bolton, into play on the trade file. The administration contends that a surfeit of steel and auto imports could shrink the U.S. manufacturing base, endangering the U.S. capacity to produce its national defence needs.Never mind the fact that the United States enjoys an overwhelming military advantage and a defence budget leagues ahead of all countries. Never mind that with respect to Canada, it has the steel trade surplus and that the two countries have been defence partners for a century and recently celebrated the 60th anniversary of NORAD (The North American Aerospace Defense Command.)In announcing the new tariffs, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that, â€œWithout a strong economy, you canâ€™t have a strong national security.â€? The American economy with a remarkably low unemployment rate of 3.9 per cent, is the strongest it has been in a long time.As Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says of the tariffs, â€œThis isnâ€™t about national security. This administration has already signalled its true objective is to leverage this tariff threat in trade negotiationsâ€¦â€?The leveraging is being applied â€“ and with potentially havoc-bearing consequences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The United States and China are now in a trade war. The foot soldiers in this kind of action â€“ import duties â€“ are being massed on each countryâ€™s borders. The question is, will the duties be deployed, or is a negotiated peace still possible?If any person other than Donald Trump were U.S. President, the answer would be yes. But his unpredictable and resentful nature forces us to downgrade to maybe.Mr. Trumpâ€™s government announced Tuesday it will impose an additional 25 per cent duty on 1,300 Chinese imports, mostly manufacturing components and machine parts. Beijing has responded with a list of 106 American imports that will get the same treatment, but has focused on things like cars, planes and soybeans.Story continues below advertisementThis follows the news on Monday that China is imposing retaliatory duties on 128 American products, mostly agricultural ones, in response to Mr. Trumpâ€™s earlier announcement of tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum.The latest round of duties wonâ€™t be in effect before late May, because the U.S. first has to go through a consultation process. Beijing is holding its fire in the meantime.This waiting period presents an opportunity for Chinese and American officials to start talking. Both countries have good reason to allow that to happen.The U.S. has legitimate beefs with Chinaâ€™s trade practices, which are blatantly weighted in favour of domestic and state-run companies, and which force foreign companies to share their intellectual property. But Mr. Trump canâ€™t afford to be stubborn and alienate voters in farming and manufacturing states whose products are being targeted by Chinaâ€™s duties.Beijing doesnâ€™t worry about elections or voters, but it is just as vulnerable to the harm caused by a drawn-out trade war. More broadly, the global economy is humming along. Why pull the handbrake on it?If Mr. Trump used the moment to bring China to the table in a spirit of mutual compromise, some good could come of both countriesâ€™ belligerent posturing.In a normal world, thatâ€™s what would happen. But in a normal world, Mr. Trumpâ€™s trade war wouldnâ€™t have started in the first place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Open this photo in gallery China's President Xi Jinping looks on during the BRICS Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, July 26, 2018. Gulshan Khan/POOL via ReutersLast year, a prominent Chinese economist declared that his country had shed its status as a mere emerging superpower and ascended to a position of unchallenged supremacy. China, Tsinghua Universityâ€™s Hu Angang said, eclipsed U.S. economic power in 2013 and surpassed American technological might in 2015.His triumphant conclusion was not supported by most statistics. But it came amid a swell of self-confidence in Beijing, where Chinaâ€™s leadership seized upon the election of Donald Trump as a moment to attain a position of new influence. Chinese President Xi Jinping went to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to position himself as the leading global champion of free trade and openly spoke about China standing astride a â€œgreat era,â€? one where the ways of Beijing presented a â€œnew optionâ€? for others to follow.Now, Mr. Xiâ€™s confidence is beginning to look like hubris. Threatened by a trade war with the United States, spurned by increasingly skeptical economic partners elsewhere and even rebuffed by potential loan recipients, the welcome for Chinaâ€™s corporate and diplomatic agenda is souring. At home, meanwhile, sharp new criticism has emerged of Chinaâ€™s posture, a rare internal rebuke that, this week, included a public petition signed by alumni of Mr. Huâ€™s own university to have him removed from one of the countryâ€™s most prestigious posts.Story continues below advertisementEven the financial markets offered a symbolic portent on Friday of Beijingâ€™s changing circumstances, after Japanâ€™s stock-market value overtook that of China for the first time since 2014.The architect of at least some of the upheaval appears to be Mr. Trump, whose unyielding pursuit of tariffs has raised worries that China is being driven into a trade war it cannot win â€“ and that part of the blame lies with Beijing for adopting a domineering posture that is now provoking global reprisal.That was among the complaints listed by the growing list of petitioners calling for Mr. Huâ€™s removal in a letter warning that claims of surpassing the United States risk contorting domestic decision-making while also provoking â€œother nations' concerns, making Chinaâ€™s neighbours afraid of us. It will harm the country and bring calamities on the people!â€? (None of the signatories responded to requests for comment.)Indeed, the spectre of a trade war has â€œrevealed underlying weaknesses and the soft underbelly of the system,â€? Tsinghua law professor Xu Zhangrun added in a searing essay published in late July. Mr. Xu faulted Mr. Xi for â€œoverweening prideâ€? and â€?vanity politicsâ€? that the professor called â€œodious.â€?His writing, broadly shared among Chinese intellectuals, crystallized some of the internal apprehensions about Chinaâ€™s course under Mr. Xi. (Among Mr. Xuâ€™s demands are the restoration of presidential term limits, the abandonment of the cult of personality around Mr. Xi, the publication of officialsâ€™ personal assets, the cessation of â€œwastefulâ€? international aid and to allow new discussion of the events around the June 4, 1989, deaths around Tiananmen Square.)The countryâ€™s elites are â€œfeeling disappointed, anxious, angry, helpless and dissatisfied with their increasingly powerful leader,â€? wrote Minxin Pei, a scholar of Chinese politics at Californiaâ€™s Claremont McKenna College, in an online commentary. Mr. Xiâ€™s ambition for Chinaâ€™s â€œrevival as a world power,â€? he wrote, has been revealed as hollow through the continuing trade dispute, which has underscored the depth of Chinese reliance on the United States.â€œFar from a rejuvenated hegemon poised to reshape the global economy, Xiâ€™s China has been exposed as a giant with feet of clay.â€?Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementConcerns inside China have emerged in parallel with a foreign re-evaluation of Beijing and its intentions. The most recent U.S. National Defence Strategy called China â€œa strategic competitor using predatory economics to intimidate its neighbours.â€? Germany, concerned about Chinese corporate raiding, enacted legislation providing Berlin new powers to block foreign acquisitions. Australian lawmakers have written new rules to counter foreign political influence.

Myanmar is moving to vastly diminish the size of a port project backed by Chinese money over debt concerns, Reuters reported this week.â€œDonald Trumpâ€™s trade war has galvanized all the previous misgivings which different countries in the West have toward China,â€? said Willy Lam, a Hong Kong-based expert in Chinese elite politics who is a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation in Washington.Those external difficulties have provided an opening for internal dissent. Mr. Xi â€œretains power as the No. 1, but his authority has been severely dented,â€? Mr. Lam said. â€œThat means the degree to which people respect him as a worthy leader of China.â€?Indeed, Mr. Trump has â€œbeen quite effective in really challenging this myth that the Chinese are invincible, because the tariffs really hurt China at a very bad time, when the economy is experiencing serious trouble,â€? said Zhang Baohui, a political science professor at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.Thatâ€™s not to say Chinaâ€™s relative position has shifted: â€œChina is a rapidly rising power. China is closing the power gap with the United States, even though it is still behind,â€? Mr. Zhang said.Story continues below advertisementBut the emergence of questioning commentary illuminates a larger problem inside China, he said: the lack of open debate under Mr. Xi, who has been vigilant about squelching dissent.â€œThe current trade war has created an opportunity for more critical voices to resurface. In a sense, it is a good thing.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Experts say US and Chinese consumers will see higher prices â€“ and fear other countries will be dragged in to the disputeDonald Trumpâ€™s announcement of tariffs on $60bn worth of Chinese imports has raised the prospect of a trade war that threatens to engulf the global economy.US imposes sanctions on China, stoking fears of trade war Read moreThe raft of trade sanctions will likely to trigger retaliation: even before the US presidentâ€™s announcement, a spokesperson for Chinaâ€™s foreign ministry said that Beijing would â€œtake all legal measures to protect our interestâ€?.Analysts believe that not only will US and Chinese businesses and consumers suffer from dampened demand and higher prices of goods, but other countries will experience collateral damage.â€œUS-China bilateral trade investment ties are integrated with global supply chains. So a US-China trade war is necessarily going to have an effect on companies and consumers in other countries,â€? said Scott Kennedy, an expert on Chinese economic policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.China is a major market for US agricultural products, cars, machinery and other products. In 2016, China was the third largest market for US exports. Conversely, more than 41% of clothing and 72% of footwear sold in the US are made in China, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association.â€œNo one will gain from these protectionist policies. By implementing tariffs, prices will rise across industries which will hurt both producers and consumers,â€? said Ashley Johnson, project manager for trade, economic and energy affairs at the National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington.More significantly, analysts say, a trade war between the worldâ€™s two biggest economies threatens to erode the system of multilateral and bilateral trade rules that has governed global markets since the 1990s â€“ promising a return to â€œa much more Hobbesian world of trade and investment,â€? according to Kennedy.â€œA rules-based system gives a basic sense of order to international economic relations. If that is gone, then when the next global financial crisis hits we could see a return to global tit-for-tat protectionism, a pattern of the 1930s that we should not wish to repeat,â€? said Gregory Shaffer, a professor at the University of Californiaâ€™s Irvine School of Law who has researched Chinese trade policy.Beyond trade, the dispute signals a shift in US-China ties where economic and political engagement is no longer seen as a way to encourage reforms and liberalisation in China â€“ part of the rationale behind US detente with China in the 1970s.â€œThe strategy has now changed. The US doesnâ€™t care about whether there will be meaningful change within China,â€? said Henry Gao, an associate professor at Singapore Management University, who also researches Chinese trade policy.The tariffs could encourage domestic Chinese sentiment to turn against the US. The announcement comes after the passage of a law allowing top US officials to visit Taiwan, a measure that China strongly opposes. Beijing views the self-ruled island as a â€œrogue provinceâ€? that belongs to China.An editorial in the state-owned Global Times warned the US against stoking Chinese patriotism, which could result in a mass boycott of US goods.It read: â€œAt that point, itâ€™s not the Chinese government fighting back, but Chinese citizens. It will become a peopleâ€™s war. Try us.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A lose-lose scenario: A soya bean oil production line at the Hopeful Grain and Oil Group factory in Sanhe, China. The factory was hit by recent tariffs on imports from the U.S. | Photo Credit: AFPmore-inChina's top envoy called on the U.S. to remain â€œcool-headedâ€? on Thursday as Washington threatened to raise the tariff rate on the next $200 billion of Chinese imports.Slapping additional tariffs on Chinese imports â€” 60% of which are made by foreign firms, including American companies â€” will only raise costs for domestic U.S. consumers, said Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.â€œWe hope that the trade policymakers in the U.S. will be cool-headed and listen to the voice of U.S. consumers... and also pay attention to the voice in the international community,â€? Mr. Wang said.â€œThe U.S. has no regard for the world... playing both soft and hard ball with China will not have any effect, and only serve to disappoint the countries and territories opposed to a trade war,â€? China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement, adding it still hopes to turn the situation around.President Donald Trump asked the U.S. Trade Representative to consider increasing the proposed tariffs to 25% from the planned 10%, USTR Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday.â€˜Harmful behaviourâ€™â€œWe have been very clear about the specific changes China should undertake. Regrettably, instead of changing its harmful behaviour, China has illegally retaliated against U.S. workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses,â€? Mr. Lighthizer said.Officials, however, downplayed suggestions the move was intended to compensate for the recent decline in the value of the Chinese currency, which has threatened to take much of the sting out of Mr. Trumpâ€™s tariffs by making imports cheaper.The U.S. dollar has been strengthening since April as the Central Bank has been raising lending rates, which draws investors looking for higher returns.Washington and Beijing are locked in battle over American accusations that Chinaâ€™s export economy benefits from unfair policies and subsidies, as well as theft of American technological know-how.Most exports targetedMr. Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on virtually all of Chinaâ€™s exports to the U.S.Officials said they remained in regular contact with their Chinese counterparts but could announce no new meeting.Mr. Wang, who is in Singapore for a Foreign Ministersâ€™ meeting, said the spat will not affect diplomatic cooperation with Washington on North Korea. In a tweet last month, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that China could be undermining a North Korean denuclearisation deal because of the ongoing trade war.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The worldâ€™s financial leaders rejected protectionism on Tuesday and urged â€œfurther dialogueâ€? on trade, but failed to diffuse the threat of a trade war days before US metals tariffs take effect and Washington is to announce measures against China.Finance ministers and central bankers of the worldâ€™s 20 biggest economies, which represent 75 per cent of world trade and 85 per cent of global gross domestic product, discussed trade disruptions as a risk to growth at a two-day meeting.But after talks described by participants as â€œpoliteâ€? and mainly consisting of read-out statements with no debate, the G20 agreed only to stand by an ambiguous declaration on trade from 2017 and â€œrecognizeâ€? the need for more â€œdialogue and actionsâ€?.â€˜Weâ€™re not afraidâ€™â€œWe reaffirm the conclusions of our leaders on trade at the Hamburg Summit and recognize the need for further dialogue and actions. We are working to strengthen contribution of trade to our economies,â€? the final G20 ministersâ€™ statement said. But the declaration did little to dispel concern over a global trade war as the United Statesâ€™ tariffs of 25 per cent on imported steel and 10 per cent on aluminum take effect on Friday.Two officials briefed on the matter said US President Donald Trump would also unveil tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese technology and telecoms products by Friday, a move stemming from Beijingâ€™s intellectual property practices.The 2017 Hamburg declaration, which the financial leaders referred to on Tuesday, said G20 countries would â€œcontinue to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practicesâ€?. But it also said G20 leaders â€œrecognize the role of legitimate trade defense instruments,â€? an ambiguity which provides the United States with a way to argue its cause on the tariffs.US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made clear Washingtonâ€™s tariff action was such a legitimate defense. â€œWe need to be prepared to act in the US interest, again, to defend free and fair, reciprocal trade,â€? he said in a press conference after the talks, adding that there was always a risk that others would reciprocate. Thereâ€™s a risk of a trade war, the President has said weâ€™re not afraid of getting into a trade war, given the size of our market, the size of our economy, and the fact that we have a big trade deficit,â€? Mnuchin said. â€œOn the steel and aluminum issue, this is a result of unfair trade practices and that's why we've responded that way,â€? he said.Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau, comparing this G20 meeting to the one in Germany last year when Mnuchin demanded a rewrite of the longstanding communique language on trade, said the rest of the world now has a better sense of the US view on how the rules of trade should be reworked. â€œThereâ€™s not a consensus, everyone around the table doesnâ€™t have the same point of view, but there's a greater understanding of what it is theyâ€™re trying to achieve,â€? Morneau said.Europe ready to retaliateThe European Union, the biggest US trading partner, wants to be exempt from the metals tariffs like Canada and Mexico, but so far has not had any success. The EU, as a result, is preparing retaliatory tariffs on US products ranging from bourbon and jeans to Harley-Davidson motorcycles.European officials said a trade war would produce only losers and the G20 were united in support of â€œmultilateralismâ€? - G20 jargon for solving disputes through negotiations in the World Trade Organization.â€œWe all agreed trade wars are a negative sum game,â€? Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco told reporters on the sidelines of the meeting. â€œThere hasnâ€™t been any voice against rule-based multilateralism.â€?French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire stressed Europe expected to get exemptions from the US tariffs without any conditions and warned protectionism would hurt world growth. â€œIt is of the utmost importance to avoid any unilateral choice that might jeopardize our growth. Unfair trade conditions, protectionism might jeopardize the economic recovery all over the world,â€? he said.Mnuchin said he has had very direct conversations with his counterparts in China and that he looks forward to working with Liu He, Chinaâ€™s newly-installed, Harvard-educated vice premier in charge of financial and industrial policy, on getting better access to the Chinese market.â€œI think thereâ€™s a general view among the G20 that it is our desire to see China open their markets so that we can participate in their markets the way they participate in ours in a much more...reciprocal... relationship,â€? Mnuchin said.The G20 also called for continued international monitoring of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, and the risks they posed. It said these assets raised issues with consumer and investor protections, market integrity, money laundering and terrorist financing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are clear signals that the current trading system represented by the WTO has lost its utility for the US and the EU. They want a new system by making the current one dysfunctional. While most of US President Donald Trumpâ€™s current actions like raising tariffs are directed against China, they violate WTO rules.The powerful western countries have controlled the global trade in the past five centuries â€” by rules if possible, and by war if necessary. During 16th to 19th centuries, Britain, driven by the Industrial Revolution, colonised China, India, US, Australia and most countries in between to get raw material and push its exports. Ditto with the other major colonial powers â€” Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands.Wars were a necessary means to promote trade. Britain fought with China in 1839-42 and again in 1860 to take control of trade with China. Four Anglo-Dutch wars during this period made the British masters of the sea trade routes leading to colonies.Trade by war continued till the end of World War II in 1945 and most colonies also became independent by this time. The victory gave the US and Britain the confidence to promote trade through rules as it was cheaper than war. They were masters of the industrial system where most products were innovated and produced efficiently. Given their dominant economic position, the rest of the world was forced to buy their products so no wars were needed. And the best way of selling the goods was to get everyone to reduce import duties.This thinking led to the formation of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) in 1947. Important GATT member countries reduced import duties significantly during 1947-1986 in eight rounds of negotiations. The US and EU were in control of the rule-making.From GATT to WTOBy late 1980s, pharmaceuticals and services industry grew in the US and the EU and needed rules to expand globally. But the GATT formulated rules for trade in goods only. To accommodate the new interests, the GATT was replaced by the WTO in 1995. The WTO covered services and intellectual property rights in addition to goods. The Dispute Settlement Mechanism was recreated as an efficient body for disputes resolution with the provision for appeal.Believing in the theory that low import duties are essential for trade growth, the US and EU committed to almost zero bound duty for most products. This meant that in future they would not be able to increase the import duty. If they did, they would violate the WTO agreement. This overconfidence proved to be their undoing. While most developing countries can now increase import duties without violating WTO rules, the US or EU cannot, as they are committed not to.In the 1990s, the US and EU could not foresee the rise of China, which was to soon become the manufacturing hub of the world. They got most WTO members to sign a plurilateral Agreement called the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) in 1996 in anticipation of promoting their dominance in Computer and telecom products.Yet, most of the benefits of the ITA were cornered by China, which had emerged as the largest electronics and IT product exporter, leaving the US and the EU far behind.China made its own rules for conducting trade. It offered free land, power, tax breaks and cheap labour to entice the MNCs. Wherever necessary, it stole intellectual property and forced technology transfer. By 2010 it became a leading supplier of computers, mobile phones, washing machines, TVs, organic chemicals, steel and items of everyday use by the common man.It produces everything from capital-intensive products like factory machinery to labour-intensive products like shoes and umbrellas. On its part, the US extracted some concessions from China before allowing it to become a member of the WTO in 2003.However, the US and the EU have not been able to beat China in trade. They are also bound by the commitments made under the WTO rules so they cannot raise import duties without violating WTO rules. But they do not want to meet the WTO obligations such as reducing agriculture subsidies.Their game plan is to put the old obligations on the back-burner and push the WTO to form rules on e-commerce, an area where the US firms have a clear edge.â€˜Deliver on Dohaâ€™But many WTO member countries want them to first deliver on the agreed issues like reduction in agriculture subsidies. This time, the US and EU are unable to bully the developing countries the way they have been doing earlier. The consensus-driven decision-making process leaves no scope for unilateral pushing of the agenda.So probably the US and the EU have decided that the WTO in its current avatar is of no use to them. One way is to weaken the WTO and Trump is doing just that. The decision to impose import duty on steel and aluminium and duty on imports worth $50 billion from China violate the commitment made at the WTO.The US had committed to zero duty on most of steel and aluminium items at the WTO in 1995. Trumpâ€™s use of threat to national security for imposing a duty on steel and aluminium and then exempting significant suppliers such as Canada and Mexico, the EU, Brazil, Argentina, Australia and South Korea show a complete disdain for the WTO rules. The US blocking the appointment of members of the Appellate Committee has also choked the WTO system.That there is no common ground between the developed and the developing countries was clear in the informal WTO Ministerial Meeting hosted by India in Delhi on March 20 where Ministers and high-level officials from 53 member countries voiced their opinion on how the WTO negotiations can be brought back on track.Most developing countries want progress on the core Doha issues such as reduction of agriculture subsidy, food security and special safeguard mechanism to guard against the imports. Developed countries are not interested in these issues andare pushing for rule-making on new issues such as e-commerce and investment facilitation. They have started pursuing these issues on a plurilateral basis which is bound to weaken the multilateral WTO system.Trade becomes the first causality if rules are weakened. India may choose to remain a keen bystander and not give in to provocations by the US or China. It could also use the time to work on strengthening its trade architecture.The writer is an Indian Trade Service officer.

"Saudi Aramco is winning thanks to U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s trade war with China.Sales of liquefied petroleum gas by the state-run producer to China -- one of its biggest Asian customers -- this year have already reached 90 per cent of all shipments in 2017, according to data from tanker-tracking and intelligence firm Kpler. Thatâ€™s because buyers in the Asian nation are seeking alternatives to American cargoes as a trade war between the worldâ€™s two biggest economies escalates with tariffs targeting billions of dollars worth of products.The surge in demand for LPG, used in everything from cooking to heating and petrochemical production, is also having an effect on contract prices that buyers elsewhere in Asia pay for Saudi cargoes, according to FGE. That means higher prices across the board for all customers to which Aramco supplies long-term cargoes, the industry consultant said.___________________Read more:Aramco, Sabic sign up KBR for $20bn oil-to-chemicals schemeAdnoc expected to announce downstream strategy 'soon', CEO saysSaudi Aramco and Sabic to build world's largest oil-to-chemicals plant___________________â€œChinese importers will definitely avoid US LPG cargoes as much as they can,â€? said Ong Han Wee, a consultant with FGE in Singapore. â€œMore Saudi cargoes have been going to China after the announcement of tariffs. This has also partly lifted up the contract price.â€?Saudi shipments to China have risen to 970,000 tons so far this year, compared with 1.08 million tons for the whole of 2017, according to Kpler. Buyers are turning to other sources of supply as the country slaps tariffs of 25 per cent on US cargoes of propane and butane in the midst of the trade war. The levy is expected to go into effect on July 20, said Scott Gray, a senior director at IHS Markit in Houston.Saudi Aramco raised contract prices for butane to $570 a ton for July, 23 per cent higher than in March. Propane term prices rose 16 per cent to $555 a ton over the same period. Prices may rise further for August on healthy demand in China and India for cooking fuel and petrochemicals, according to one customer in Asia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Donald Trump prepared the ground for a full-scale trade war as he announced plans to impose tariffs worth up to $50 billion on China in response to the theft of US technology and anti-competitive practices.The US president proposed tariffs of 25 per cent on Chinese imports of aerospace equipment and machinery as a punishment for what he said was unfair industrial policies.Hours later, China responded by announcing plans for reciprocal tariffs on $3 billion of imports from the US.According to Bloomberg News, Chinaâ€™s Commerce Ministry said it plans a 25 percent tariff on US pork imports and recycled aluminium, and 15 percent tariffs on American steel pipes, fruit and wine.The moves set the scene for a collision between the worldâ€™s two most powerful economic powers that will have ramifications around the world.Mr Trump's measures specifically target hi-tech products and key industries that China hopes will drive its future economic fortunes. Mr Trump said the US would also propose restrictions on Chinese investment in sensitive US technology.The measures were widely anticipated after the president launched an inquiry in August last year into Chinese trade practices and protectionism._______________Read more:Trump may impose $50bn in China tariffs over intellectual-property violations_______________The inquiry concluded that China was behind the hacking of US companies to steal trade secrets and other sensitive commercial information.A White House statement cited the 2014 case when the US charged five Chinese military hackers with cyber espionage against US businesses for commercial advantage. The inquiry also concluded that US companies were being forced into handing over technological secrets in return for access to the Chinese market.The White House said a list of the proposed tariffs would be published within 15 days. Trade officials have already identified 1,300 products worth about $48 billion.The measures are a response to a major trade imbalance between the two counties and what Mr Trump said was the â€œlargest deficit of any country in the history of the worldâ€?. He added:â€œItâ€™s out of control.â€?He said that he saw China as a friend but was acting to prevent what he called â€œtremendous intellectual property theftâ€?.â€œUnder my administration, the theft of American prosperity will end,â€? he said in a statement. â€œWeâ€™re going to defend our industry and create a level playing field for the American worker, finally.â€?The announcement marked Mr Trumpâ€™s first trade measures aimed directly at China which he blames for affecting the US manufacturing sector and the loss of jobs.The announcements followed plans to impose import tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium but has offered a series of exemptions to trading partners.The series of measures and threats has sparked concerns of a new era of global protectionism with countries responding with tit-for-tat measures to protect their own domestic industries.Policy makers, including Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has warned that a global trade conflict could undermine the broadest world recovery in years.Mr Trump also turned his fire on the European Union, complaining that the 28-nation trading bloc had high and unequal tariff barriers. But the EU is expected to win an exemption on the metal tariffs.â€œIt could be a watershed moment,â€? said Stephen Ezell, vice president of global innovation policy at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a think tank. â€œThe Trump administration's decision to go down this path is illustrative that previous strategies have not borne the hoped-for fruit.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BRICS nations pledge unity against US trade war threatJohannesburg: Five of the biggest emerging economies on Thursday stood by the multilateral system and vowed to strengthen economic cooperation in the face of US tariff threats and unilateralism.The heads of the so-called BRICS -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- met for an annual summit dominated by the risk of a global US-led trade war, although leaders did not publicly mention President Donald Trump by name.'We should stay committed to multilateralism,' ChinaÂ´s President Xi Jinping said on the second day of the Johannesburg talks.'The escalation of protectionism and unilateralism are directly affecting... emerging markets,' he said in a statement in the dayÂ´s opening session.'Closer economic cooperation for shared prosperity is the original purpose and priority of BRICS.'Russian President Vladimir Putin, who held a controversial meeting with Trump last week, echoed the calls for closer ties among BRICS members and for stronger trade within group.'BRICS has a unique place in the global economy -- this is the largest market in the world, the joint GDP is 42 percent of the global GDP and it keeps growing,' Putin said.'In 2017, the trade with our BRICS countries has grown 30 percent, and we are aiming at further developing this kind of partnership.'Trump has said he is ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of Chinese imports, complaining that ChinaÂ´s trade surplus with the US is due to unfair currency manipulation.Trump has already slapped levies on goods from China worth tens of billions of dollars, as well as tariffs on steel and aluminium from the EU, Canada and Mexico.'We are concerned by the rise in unilateral measures that are incompatible with World Trade Organisation rules, and we are worried about the impact,' South African President Cyril Ramaphosa told the summitÂ´s opening session on Wednesday.The BRICS group, comprising more than 40 percent of the global population, represents some of the biggest emerging economies, but it has struggled to find a unified voice.Analysts say US trade policy could give the group renewed purpose.In Washington, Trump and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker announced an apparent truce in their trade war after White House talks on Wednesday.The US and the EU will 'immediately resolve' their dispute over US steel and aluminum tariffs and subsequent EU counter-measures, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed Thursday.The punishing US metals tariffs had angered WashingtonÂ´s major trading partners including the EU and sparked retaliation against important American exports, spooking global stock markets.Xi arrived in South Africa after visiting Senegal and Rwanda as part of a whistlestop tour to cement relations with African allies.

"In French Existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre's book No Exit the philosopher's punchline is, 'Hell is other people.' Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is not as well read in philosophy as his father was, but after the G7 Summit in Charlevoix, Que., this weekend, he can almost certainly relate.U.S. President Donald Trump came to Quebec spoiling for a fight. The previous week, he announced that the temporary exemptions from punitive steel and aluminum tariffs that he had given to Canada, the countries of the European Union, Japan and Mexico would not be renewed. Trump had also launched a process to impose a 25 per cent tariff on all vehicles imported into the United States.Meanwhile, the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has not been going well. Trump refused a call from Trudeau unless Trudeau first agreed to the U.S. demand for a five-year sunset clause in a new NAFTA agreement. Had Trudeau agreed, that might have been the most expensive call in Canadian history.Like an Agatha Christie murder mystery, all of the G7 leaders gathering in Charlevoix had a motive to confront Trump. Yet Trump's volcanic temper was directed at one leader in particular: Trudeau.Trump's anger with Trudeau has been building for some time. In February, Trump complained that Canada was 'very smooth' on trade. This wasn't a compliment; Trump was conveying his frustration that Members of Congress and state governors were quoting Canadian arguments and trade data back to him. Trump prides himself on his ability to read the public mood. Canada's unprecedented, evidence-based outreach to U.S. leaders and businesses was showing Canada could do the same.Then last month, Trump vented that Canada was 'very spoiled' and 'very difficult' on trade. It was the kind of thing you'd say about a cranky child, not a fellow world leader.Then last week, Trudeau appeared on NBC's Sunday public affairs program Meet the Press with Chuck Todd, a longtime critic of Trump's. On the program, Trudeau called Trump's use of section 232 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1962 to impose steel, aluminum and even automotive tariffs on Canada under the justification that they were necessary for U.S. national security, 'insulting and unacceptable.'If Trump didn't appreciate this push back from Trudeau on a domestic U.S. broadcast popular with establishment Republicans and Democrats, he has only himself to blame. And not just because of his most recent tariff threats.No one expected a repeat of the 'bromance' Trudeau has with former U.S. President Barack Obama after Trump was elected as Obama's successor. Trudeau and his team made a conscious decision to impose message discipline on the Liberal caucus and maintain a firm but friendly approach to the United States. Personal relationships were cultivated within the Trump White House, with Trudeau himself working on a personal rapport with the president.After the first 500 days of what the White House is promoting as 'American Greatness,' what has Trudeau got to show for his persistent outreach to Trump? Canadians are paying softwood tariffs, paying the price of NAFTA uncertainty with no end in sight, and now being threatened with even more tariffs. This explains why Trudeau and his government have been shifting their approach to the Trump administration, pushing back against Trump's accusations and criticisms of Canada.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Separately, the Trump administration is considering imposing additional tariffs on Chinese goods to punish Beijing for alleged theft of intellectual property, according to people familiar with the matter.â€œWe might not get our acceleration in global growth to 4.1% that we expect this year,â€? said Schnider. â€œSo a deceleration will be bad.

"Leiking says palm oil industry could benefit from disputePETALING JAYA: Newly-appointed International Trade and Industry Minister Darell Leiking sees opportunities for Malaysia in the event of a trade war between the US and China.â€œChina is a very big importer of our goods, so there are a lot of opportunities for us during a trade war. â€œWe can engage with China (on the available opportunities) and see how we can work together,â€? he told reporters.Leiking, who is also Penampang MP, said the Malaysian palm oil industry could be among the sectors to benefit in the event of the trade war.Chinaâ€™s potential imposition of 25% retaliatory import tariffs on US soybeans is seen as an opportunity for the palm oil industry to increase its exports to the country.This is because lower soybean imports from the US would create a shortfall of edible oil into China, which is likely to benefit palm oil.Last year, Malaysiaâ€™s exports of agri-commodities and agri-commodity-based products to China rose 27% to RM19.1bil compared with RM15bil in 2016.China is the second largest export market for Malaysian palm oil after India.According to data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Council, the export of palm oil to China rose 13.68% to 710,051 tonnes between January and May 2018 compared to the same period a year ago.On the suspension of works on the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project, Leiking said it would not affect the trade relationship between the two countries.On July 3, Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng announced that the final cost of the ECRL was a staggering RM81bil and that the 688-km rail project would only be continued once the cost was lowered to a financially-viable level.Citing â€œnational interestâ€?, project owner Malaysia Rail Link Sdn Bhd (MRL) ordered ECRLâ€™s main contractor China Communications Construction Company Ltd to halt all engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) contract works, pending further instruction.â€œOur trading relationship with China is still good.â€œMalaysia is still the main hub that everybody wants to engage with,â€?

"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian palm oil futures registered its sharpest daily decline in a month on Monday evening, falling for a third straight day on weakness in soyoil on the Chicago Board of Trade.The benchmark palm oil contract for October delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange was down 1.7 percent at 2,204 ringgit ($538.88) a tonne at the end of the trading day for its sharpest daily decline since July 13.It had dropped earlier by as much as 1.9 percent to 2,200 ringgit, its lowest since Aug. 7.Trading volumes stood at 35,352 lots of 25 tonnes each at the end of the trading day.'Palm is down on soyoil,' said a Kuala Lumpur-based futures trader, referring to soyoil's sharp declines on Friday. Soyoil and soybeans on the U.S. Chicago Board of Trade fell on marketconcern that a trade dispute between Washington and Beijing would cause U.S. stockpiles, already projected at a record high, to rise even further.The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday raised its outlook for domestic corn and soybean harvests by a more than expected amount because of good weather during key phases ofdevelopment.The trader also said that palm oil could remain bearish in the medium term, citing rising production and end-stocks.'August exports are also not going to be good, as buyers would wait for the zero percent crude palm oil export tax rate to begin in September,' he added.Malaysia lowered its export tax on crude palm oil for September to 0 percent, down from 4.5 percent in August, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) said on Monday, citing the national customs department.The MPOB had reported on Friday that July end-stocks in Malaysia rose by 1.3 percent to 2.21 million tonnes in a second month of gains, while exports grew by 6.8 percent from June to 1.21 million tonnes.Production in July rose 12.8 percent from the previous month to 1.5 million tonnes and is set to climb in line with the seasonal trend until its peak towards the last quarter of the year.A second palm oil trader said that palm also came under pressure in the afternoon from concerns over the U.S.-China trade dispute.In related oils, the Chicago December contract for soybean oil extended Friday's 1.6 percent decline, dropping by 0.8 percent on Monday.The January soybean oil contract on China's Dalian Commodity Exchange dropped 0.9 percent, while the Dalian January palm oil contract was also down 0.7 percent.Palm oil prices are affected by movements of other edible oils that compete in the global vegetable oils market. - Reuters",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"KUALA LUMPUR: Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd is currently monitoring the impact of the escalating trade war between the United States and China on the petrochemical industry.Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer Datuk Sazali Hamzah pointed out that there is no serious threat to the industry at the moment.â€œOur business is still as usual. But we are closely monitoring the situation, the trade war between China and the US. In the long term, it is not as good as it may impact some of the industrial growth in China. The industry will normalise at the end.â€œOur customers in China are still actively pursuing strategic collaborations with us,â€? he told reporters on the sidelines of Asia Petrochemical Industry Conference 2018 (APIC 2018) here today.On Petronas Chemicalsâ€™ exposure to the currency volatility in Turkey and India, Sazali said the company is quite stable in terms of cash generation.â€œIndia is an opportunity market. Our base markets are still Southeast Asia and China. China represents 16 per cent of our total volume,â€? he said, also noting surging demand for its petrochemical products from China.Moving forward, the company is looking to strengthen its downstream activities in its plants such as RAPID and Kerteh.â€œWe are moving towards increasing our total capacity to 14.6 million tonnes from 12.7 million tonnes after the completion of the Pengerang Integrated Complex in Johor,â€? said Sazali.Earlier in his special address, Sazali said the Asia Pacific region is seeing rapid economic growth supported by increasing urbanisation, contributing to a rise in demand for petrochemical products.â€œThe petrochemical industry is well-placed to leverage on its proximity to the pulse of urbanisation, with 90 per cent of global urbanisation expected to take place in the East such as Africa and Asia.â€œA growing middle-income population will lead to higher consumption, driving the demand for chemicals in the packaging, construction chemicals, personal care, electronics and automotive sectors,â€? he added.Sazali said consumption growth is expected to be driven by Asian millennials followed by American millennials, while the changing landscape brought about by mega-trends such as urbanisation presents a need for collaboration across the chemical value chain, particularly between manufacturers and end-users.APIC 2018 is organised by the Malaysian Petrochemicals Association, with Petronas as the corporate supporting organisation.

"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysiaâ€™s third push to build a national car brand may see it sourcing parts from Southeast Asian neighbors, as the region forges stronger ties to weather out the U.S.-China trade tensions.Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamadâ€™s dream of developing a homegrown automotive brand has courted interest from neighboring countries, Minister of International Trade and Industry Darell Leiking said in an interview with Bloomberg Televisionâ€™s Sophie Kamaruddin in Kuala Lumpur.â€œWhat Mahathir meant was that he needed something where Malaysians can get together, Asean can get together, to supply components of this vehicle and make it into a national car in Asean, not only in Malaysia,â€? said Leiking.â€œItâ€™s ambitious but I think that itâ€™s necessary now, more so when you want to create an economic bloc like Asean.â€?As a trade war between the U.S. and China deepens, the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, has benefited from its fallout as companies shift orders and move production bases to the region.It was the top destination among the one-third of more than 430 American companies in China that considered moving operations elsewhere, according to a survey by AmCham China and AmCham Shanghai.Toyota Motor Corp., Tata Motors Ltd. and Ford Motor Co. already operate assembly plants in Thailand, the biggest car manufacturer in Southeast Asia. The country seeks to ramp up production to 3.5 million units in 2020, an 80 percent increase from 2016, and exports the vehicles to Australia, Japan, as well as Malaysia and Indonesia.Malaysia stands to gain as a trans-shipment point, capitalizing on its location by the Straits of Malacca -- a historic channel connecting Asiaâ€™s biggest economies from Japan and China to India and beyond.Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said the trade war will be positive for the country over the next year or so, especially in electronics and steel as the worldâ€™s two biggest economies seek alternatives for supplies.Privately DrivenThe government is gathering views from the industry on developing the new car brand, and will let the project be driven and funded by the private sector, Leiking said. The government will assist in licensing and facilitation, he said.Dr Mahathir revived his vision of a homegrown car brand just a month into his premiership. He started automaker Proton Holdings Bhd. in the 1980s during his previous tenure, but the brand was later privatized and almost half the stake sold to Chinaâ€™s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.A second effort was made in the 1990s with Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua Sendirian Bhd., also known as Perodua.This time, however, the new car will compete in a market beyond Malaysia, Leiking said.â€œProton has already achieved what theyâ€™ve wanted and theyâ€™re there,â€? he said. â€œSo this is not competing with Proton, this is not competing even with Perodua, this is not competing with anyone. This is a separate thing altogether.â€?Advise and PrayA successful carmaker could help boost the nationâ€™s exports, which relies on commodities such as crude and palm oil, as well as electronics. Shipments declined 0.3 percent in August from a year ago, falling far short of economist estimates for an 8 percent increase. That narrowed the trade surplus to 1.6 billion ringgit ($385 million), from 8.3 billion ringgit in July.Malaysia had taken into account the possible knock-on effects that global trade tensions may have on the supply chain. The government has engaged with representatives from the U.S. on the matter and was banking on the worldâ€™s two largest economies remaining rational.â€œEventually America and the Chinese will come to an understanding, and I pray that they do,â€? Leiking said. â€œWhat else can we do other than advise them and pray? I have faith that they will come to their senses.â€? - Bloomberg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LANGKAWI: Malaysia is likely to benefit from the trade war between China and the United States in terms of attracting foreign investors, says Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.He said policies implemented in this trade war would benefit investors who could not invest in certain countries, thus benefiting countries that were not involved.â€œWe are not involved (in this trade war) and there is a possibility those (investors) who cannot go to certain countries, they will come here,â€? he said at a media conference here yesterday.The trade war between the two superpowers accelerated on WedÂ­nesÂ­day when the US administration upped the ante by recommending a 25% tariff on imports from China worth US$200bil (RM1 trillion).Asked if Malaysia was ready to face an influx of foreign investors following the trade war, Dr Mahathir said: â€œ(For) foreign investment, we are always ready.â€?At the media conference, Dr Mahathir also called on supporters of Pakatan Harapan not to take it easy in the by-elections that would be held in Selangor despite having won the 14th General Election.â€œIf they do that, there is a possibility Pakatan Harapan will lose. Thatâ€™s why we ask the voters to go out and vote,â€? he said.Commenting on Barisan Nasionalâ€™s decision to give way for PAS to contest in the Seri Setia state constituency in Selangor, he said it proved that a pact had taken place between the two opposition parties.â€œWe know for sure they are not separate parties. In front of us, they are segregated but in actual fact, they are one party,â€? he said.Earlier, Dr Mahathir, who is also Langkawi MP, officiated the Langkawi Nature Park, a nature park that featured over 80 species of fauna from within and outside the country.He said the island still had enough land to be used to start such a project and some Malaysian companies had demonstrated the capability to implement it. â€” Bernama",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Before the U.S.-China trade war, American pig processors exported nine out of every 10 pigs' feet and heads they shipped overseas to China and Hong Kong - for prices higher than they would fetch anywhere else.Those parts and others that most Americans won't eat - hearts, tongues, stomachs, entrails - have a special place in Chinese culinary culture and, consequently, in the profit margins of U.S. pork exporters.'You often hear that the products are what keep the plants running,' said Erin Borror, economist for U.S. Meat Export Federation, a trade group.The pipeline for these profitable pig parts, known collectively as offal, is closing fast after China slapped two tariffs on U.S. pork totalling 50 percent.That's forcing U.S. processors to sell an increasing amount of such parts for pennies to be rendered into food for pets and livestock.U.S. shipments of byproducts affected by the duties fell by about a third in April and May combined, after China imposed the first 25 percent tariff on American pork in April, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.On July 6, Beijing implemented an additional 25 percent duty as the world's two largest economies slapped tariffs on $34 billion worth of each others' goods.U.S. President Donald Trump has said the U.S. tariffs - which have provoked equivalent Chinese retaliation - aim to close the $335 billion annual U.S. trade deficit with China.The USDA declined to comment on the drop in offal exports.Exporting pig offal to China has been a money-maker because consumers there enjoy its strong flavour. Stewed pigs' feet with white beans, for instance, is a famous dish from Sichuan province, one of the country's culinary capitals.At least one product exported to China has almost zero value anywhere else: hind pigs' feet. Rear feet are nearly impossible to sell elsewhere because they have holes in them from where hogs are hung upside down in packing houses, which turns off consumers in other countries, said Dermot Hayes, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University.'They go from zero value outside of China to a significant value when the Chinese market is fully open,' Hayes said.ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIES OF STOMACHS, LIVERSChina will likely have little trouble finding supplies to replace U.S. pig offal, analysts said.An expansion of its domestic hog industry had already made buyers less dependent on American pork before the trade tensions.Chinese buyers could also import more from Europe, where hog prices have been trading at their lowest levels in at least two years, analysts said.'The Chinese aren't going to get hurt by this,' said Ken Maschhoff, chairman of The Maschhoffs, the largest family-owned U.S. pork producer. 'Chile or Europe or somebody else is going to say, 'Well, we've got a bunch of stomachs or livers or feet that we're not using...''The slowdown hurts major processors in the United States, such as WH Group Ltd's Smithfield Foods Inc; Seaboard Foods, a division of Seaboard Corp; and the JBS USA unit of Brazil's JBS SA. Such companies benefited from record total U.S. offal sales of more than $1.1 billion in 2017.Smithfield, the biggest U.S. pork processor and exporter to China, declined to comment. The company, owned by China-based WH Group, sells offal, jowls and lard, according to its website.Meat processor Tyson Foods Inc also declined to comment. Seaboard and JBS did not respond to requests for comment.Margins for U.S. pork processors are under pressure due to the impact of the trade fight and last month slipped to their lowest level in three years.WH Group's stock price has tumbled 28 percent so far this year. Tyson shares are down 19 percent and Seaboard shares have dropped 13 percent.$860 MILLION IN LOSSESThe average value of U.S. offal exports to China was about 76 cents (57p) per pound in 2017, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation.If packers do not sell them elsewhere for human consumption, the byproducts will be rendered in the United States for about 18 cents per pound - a decrease equating to a loss of $1.55 per hog for the volume exported to China, the federation said.Overall, it estimated lower offal prices could translate into losses of $860 million (Â£652 million) for the U.S. pork industry over the next year. Processors will try to pass on losses to farmers by paying less for live hogs, Hayes said.'It is the pork farmer who suffers,' he said.Lower demand also has processors rendering more offal into animal feed, according to the federation. Prices in that segment could come under pressure, however, as more processors try to grab market share.Ohio-based JH Routh Packing Company sells most of its offal to feed animals at less than 20 cents per pound, sales manager Tony Stearns said.'Everybody who can sell the stuff,' he said about offal, 'they're pretty much selling everything they can.'Pet food makers could use more offal in their products in response to an increase of supply, said Dana Brooks, president of the Pet Food Institute, an industry group that represents the pet units of companies including Nestle SA, which sells Purina, and Mars Inc, which sells the Pedigree and Whiskas brands.'The parts that we don't eat here in America for pork often have nutritional value to our pets,' Brooks said.(Additional reporting by Theopolis Waters in Chicago and Dominique Patton in Beijing; Editing by Brian Thevenot)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LAST Thursday, US President DoÂ­Â­Â­nald Trump signed a proclamation to raise tariffs for steel by 25% and for aluminium by 10%.It sent shockwaves across the world not only because of the losses to metal exporters, but due to what it may signify â€“ the start of a global trade war that will cause economic disruption and may damage, if not destroy, the multilateral trade system.The United States, joined by Europe, has been the anchor of the global free trade system since the end of World War II. In practice, this rhetoric of free trade was hypocritical because the West continues to have very high protection of their agriculture sector, which cannot compete with those of many developing countries.Moreover, the developed countries champion high intellectual property rights standards through an agreement in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), under which their companies create monopolies, set high prices and make excessive profits. This is against the free competition touted by free-trade advocates.In manufacturing and metals, the developed countries have pressed the others to join them in cutting or removing tariffs and to expand trade, through negotiations in the WTO and its predecessor, the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).They have argued that poorer countries can best grow richer by cutting their tariffs, thus benefiting consumers and forcing their producers to become more efficient.Trumpâ€™s move upends the ideology of free trade. According to his America First philosophy, if cheaper imports displaced local steel and aluminium producers, these imports must be stopped because a country must make its own key products.Since the US has been the flag-bearer of the free-trade religion, this has profound effects on other countries. If the leader has changed its mind and now believes in openly protecting its industries, so too can other countries. The basis for liberal trade is destroyed and the old rationale for protectionism is revived.The WTO rules allow countries adversely affected by imports to take certain measures, but they have to prove that the producers of exporting countries unfairly receive subsidies or set lower prices for their exports. Or they can take â€œsafeguardâ€? measures of raising tariffs but only for a limited period to help affected local producers to adjust.Trump however made use of a little-used national security clause (Section 232) in the US trade laws to justify his big jump in steel and aluminium tariffs. The clause allows the President to take trade action to defend security. The WTO also has a security exception in GATT Article XXI.But what constitutes national security is not clearly spelt out either in the US or the WTO laws, and countries can abuse this clause.The Trump administration tried to justify invoking the security factor by saying steel and aluminium are needed to make weapons of war. But this was undercut by giving exemptions from the increased duties to Canada and Mexico due to their membership of Nafta, the North American Free Trade AgreeÂ­ment that includes the US. The exemptions for reasons unrelated to security exposes the security rationale as fake.Other countries are angry and preparing to retaliate. The European Union has drawn up a list of American products on which its member countries will raise tariffs. China warned it would make an appropriate and necessary resÂ­ponse.At the WTO General Council on March 8, the US action was attacked. Many countries condemned the unilateral move and the use of the national security rationale. Canada said the security issue â€œmay be opening a Pandoraâ€™s box we would not be able to closeâ€?.Brazil expressed deep concern about an elastic or broad application of the national security exception. India said the national security exception under GATT should not be misused and unilateral measures have no place in the trade system. China argued that the over-protected domestic industry would never be able to solve its problems through protectionism.Many WTO member states will most likely take the US to a dispute panel, and the outcome will have strong consequences. If the panel rules for the US, then other countries will view the decision as permission for all countries to take protectionist measures on the grounds of security.If the decision goes against the US, it will strengthen the anti-liberal trade faction and tendency in the Trump administration to ignore or even leave the WTO.Malaysia will be affected by the new tariffs as it exports 96,000 tonnes of steel to the US. But this is small compared to how much steel we import.The bigger blow to us is the US measure in January to slap up to 30% tariffs on solar cells and panels. Malaysia is the largest photovoltaic cells exporter to the US, with a market share of 30%. The tariff increase will have a big impact on the solar industry, a solar company chief was quoted as saying last month.The next big protectionist move from the US may come in a few weeks when Trump decides what action, if any, to take against China after considering a Commerce Department report on Chinaâ€™s trade and intellectual property practices.If strong action against China is announced, China can be expected to take strong retaliatory action.That may escalate the trade war that is already under way.Martin Khor is executive director of the South Centre.

"As the US and China threaten to impose tariffs on goods from aluminium to wine, the two nations are waging a separate economic battle that could determine who owns the next wave of computing.Chinese universities and US technology companies such as International Business Machines Corp and Microsoft Corp are racing to develop quantum computers, a type of processing thatâ€™s forecast to be so powerful it can transform how drug-makers, agriculture companies and auto manufacturers discover compounds and materials.Quantum computing uses the movement of subatomic particles to process data in amounts that modern computers canâ€™t handle. Mostly theoretical now, the technology is expected to be able to perform calculations that make todayâ€™s computers look akin to an abacus.While overall spending by China is unknown, its government is building a US$10bil (RM38.67bil) National Laboratory for Quantum Information Sciences in Hefei, Anhui Province, which is slated to open in 2020. US-funded research in quantum is about US$200mil (RM773.46mil) a year, according to a July 2016 government report, and some researchers and companies donâ€™t believe thatâ€™s enough.One â€œkiller appâ€? may be encryption, the code scrambling technology that secures modern global commerce and communications. China, Chinese universities and western financial institutions are rushing to patent more ways to use quantum technology for encryption, a study by research firm Patinformatics found.'Unhackable systemâ€™â€œWeâ€™re talking about encrypting data so it canâ€™t be broken, certainly not by a classical computer,â€? said Tony Trippe, managing director of Dublin, Ohio-based Patinformatics. â€œIt would be an unhackable system.â€?At the same time, it could break encryption that was on a classical computer. â€œAn organisation or a nation that had quantum computer technologies would have a significantly easier time of wreaking havoc on other systems,â€? he said.US President Donald Trump accused the Chinese government in March of stealing intellectual property by forcing American companies to share their most valuable secrets and sign joint venture agreements with local firms if they want to operate in China, although there are no specific allegations regarding quantum computers.Chinaâ€™s innovationChina has also been aggressive in pushing home-grown innovation as it supports companies in obtaining patents and trademarks around the world, and has increased its research funding. In its annual scorecard, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development called China â€œthe second largest scientific powerhouse,â€? behind the US.Technology companies from Microsoft to IBM to Alphabet Incâ€™s Google view quantum computing as the next revolution.â€œOver time, quantum in the field of computation is so important is that it will redefine the category of computers themselves,â€? said Dario Gil, vice president of IBMâ€™s Artificial Intelligence research. â€œIt is the future of computing.â€?IBMâ€™s inventions may be having the most impact on the nascent field, when judged by the number of times its research has been cited by others in their patent applications. The Armonk, New York-based company already has developed computers being tested by customers, including Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the Energy Departmentâ€™s biggest lab, as well as finance companies like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Barclays Plc, Gil said.'Tough problemsâ€™Intel Corp, which started its own program two years ago, said the technology promises to be â€œtransformational.â€?â€œThere are many tough problems to solve before quantum computing is a commercial reality,â€? said Jim Clarke, director of quantum hardware at Intel. â€œSome of these problems involve materials science, quantum chip design and manufacturing â€“ those are sweet-spot problems for Intel.â€?Clarke said Intel is competitive in the number of patents itâ€™s seeking, though many arenâ€™t yet public. Applications are made public after 18 months.While there will still be a place for whatâ€™s being called â€œclassical computersâ€? â€“ a category that includes modern smartphones and even super computers â€“ the quantum computers could have â€œan infinite number of applicationsâ€? in the fields of life sciences, chemistry and agriculture, said IBMâ€™s Gil.'Patent the potentialâ€™Itâ€™s too early to say which company or country will be the leader in quantum computers, though at this stage it looks like U.S. companies will excel in hardware while Chinese and Japanese ones are focused on the software and applications, Patinformaticsâ€™ Trippe said.â€œJapanese and Chinese companies arenâ€™t as concerned about building them as they are about how theyâ€™ll be used,â€? Trippe said. â€œTheyâ€™ve started to patent the potential. The next five years are going to be pretty fascinating.â€?The US China Economic and Security Review Commission, created by Congress in 2000 to assess national security implications of bilateral trade between the countries, said in its most recent report that China â€œhas closed the technological gapâ€? with the US in quantum information science, a sector Americans have long dominated, â€œdue to a concerted strategy by the Chinese government and inconsistent and unstable levels of R&D funding and limited government coordination by the United States.â€?Quantum physicsStudies by the US Chamber of Commerce and Bloomberg have independently shown that China is rising in its overall score for innovation, which includes education, government research and the number of patents. The World Intellectual Property Organization reported March 21 that China is closing in on the US in filing international patent applications.Quantum physics is one area in which the Chinese government, through its Ministry of Science and Technology, is beefing up its technological prowess, according to a report by the US Trade Representative that laid the groundwork for Trumpâ€™s tariff plans. The China Academy of Sciences and Beijing University are among the Chinese research firms seeking more patents on quantum information technology, according to Patinformatics.The Chinese government invested by giving a lot of money to companies and researchers to â€œreplicate what we did in the US and elsewhere,â€? said Carl J. Williams, deputy director of the Physical Measurement Laboratory at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. â€œTheyâ€™ve come a long ways.â€?Encryption focusThe Chinese researchers are focused on encryption, based on their patent applications. In August 2016, Chinaâ€™s state news agency said the government had launched the worldâ€™s first quantum communications satellite, and a year later claimed to have sent the first â€œunbreakableâ€? code from space.â€œThat should be very scary,â€? said Jonathan Dowling, co-director of Louisiana State Universityâ€™s Hearne Institute for Theoretical Physics, â€œat least to the intelligence agencies.â€?In the US, the Department of Energy, Naval Research Lab and defence contractor Northrop Grumman Corp are among the government entities or contractors researching quantum computers. Overall, though, the US government has cut back on its own funding of computing and cryptography hardware, Dowling said.'Considered a priorityâ€™A July 2016 report by the National Science and Technology Council under former President Barack Obama recommended it be â€œconsidered a priority for federal coordination and investment.â€?In the coming age of quantum, itâ€™s an open question whether federal funding will enable the US to maintain the edge itâ€™s had during the PC era and smartphone wars. Scott Crowder, IBMâ€™s chief technology officer for quantum computing, told a House panel in October that â€œthe US government investment in driving this critical technology is not sufficient to stay competitive.â€?LSUâ€™s Dowling said it could mean the US comes out the loser in the quantum race.â€œWhat weâ€™re seeing is a bunch of different things going on at once with no overall organisation,â€? LSUâ€™s Dowling said, â€œunlike in China, where they are exactly sure what theyâ€™re doing.â€? â€” Bloomberg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The United States on Wednesday announced a proposed list of products imported from China that could be subject to additional tariffs of 25 per cent amounting to $50 billion.The US Trade Representative (USTR) said the proposed list of products is based on extensive interagency economic analysis and would target products that benefit from China's industrial plans while minimising the impact on the US economy.Sectors subject to the proposed tariffs include industries such as aerospace, information and communication technology, robotics, and machinery.The list covers approximately 1,300 separate tariff lines and will undergo further review in a public notice and comment process, including a hearing. After completion of this process, the USTR will issue a final determination on the products subject to the additional duties.The total value of imports subject to the tariff increase is commensurate with an economic analysis of the harm caused by China's unreasonable technology transfer policies to the US economy, the USTR said.China had said on Tuesday that its door for talks with the Trump administration is open but if there is a trade war it will 'fight till the end'. The comments came a day after Beijing imposed tariffs on 128 American products as a retaliation against US duties on steel and aluminium.China had imposed tariffs on 128 US imports worth $3 billion, including meat, fruit and pork, as retaliation against taxes approved by US President Donald Trump on imported steel and aluminium.Last month, Trump announced that the US will impose tariffs on approximately $50 billion worth of Chinese imports and take other actions in response to China's policies that coerce American companies into transferring their technology and intellectual property to domestic Chinese enterprises.These policies bolster China's stated intention of seizing economic leadership in advanced technology as set forth in its industrial plans, such as 'Made in China 2025'.Trump raked up the issue of trade gap with China once again, saying the US cannot afford to have a $500 billion a year trade deficit with Beijing.'We have a problem with China. They've created a trade deficit, and I really blame our representatives and, frankly, our preceding presidents for this. They have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year. It's not something we can live with,' Trump told reporters during a media interaction with visiting Baltic leaders.The theft of intellectual property alone, he said, is probably around $200-300 billion a year.'The US has to do something on trade with certain countries. And obviously, China is the leader in terms of deficits. We've never had a situation where a countryâ€”nor has there ever been inâ€”in history, a situation where a country has done that to another country,' he said.However, several industry groups were quick to oppose Trump's proposal to impose tariff on some 1,300 selected Chinese products.'The Trump administration is right to push back against China's abuse of economic and trade policy, but imposing tariffs on producer goods will inadvertently hurt Americans through reduced capital investment and lower productivity growth. The list of tariffs that the USTR has proposed today would hurt companies in the US by raising the prices and reducing consumption of the capital equipment they rely on to produce their goods and services,' Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) President Robert D. Atkinson said.Attempts to roll back Chinese innovation mercantilism should be more carefully targeted than this. The focus should be on things that will create the most leverage over China without raising prices and dampening investment in the kinds of machinery, equipment, and other technology that drives innovation and productivity across the economy, he said.Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of International Affairs at the US Chamber of Commerce said the administration is rightly focused on restoring equity and fairness in US trade relationship with China.'However, imposing taxes on products used daily by American consumers and job creators is not the way to achieve those ends. The US Chamber looks forward to working with the administration throughout the comment period to make the business community's voice heard on the US-China economic relationship,' he said.But several US lawmakers supported Trump's move.'Publishing this preliminary list is an important step that will allow US companies to evaluate the implications and convey their views about the effect of such tariffs on our economy. I'm confident that we can protect national security and minimize unfair trading practices while protecting American consumers and jobs,' House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady said.'We must address China's theft of technology and intellectual property belonging to American companies. It is a serious problem that requires action,' said Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade Chairman Dave Reichert.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"You need Javascript and either Adobe Flash or Html5 to view this video.The Trump administration on Tuesday said it will use a Great Depression-era program to pay up to $12 billion to help US farmers weather a growing trade war with China, the European Union and others that the president began.It is a clear signal the US President Donald Trump is determined to stick with tariffs as his weapon of choice in the conflict.The move meant to cushion the blow for a politically important constituency was met with broad criticism by many farmers and farm-belt lawmakers, including Republicans. Rural and agricultural states supported Trump by wide margins in the 2016 election.Trump's trade policies have become central in several rural-state US Senate races ahead of congressional elections in November.The president, speaking at an event in Kansas City on Tuesday, reaffirmed his support for tariffs and pledged that 'farmers will be the biggest beneficiary.''Just be a little patient,' Trump said.The relief package is intended as a temporary boost to farmers as the United States and China negotiate over trade issues, officials said.'This obviously is a short-term solution that will give President Trump time to work on a long-term trade policy,' said Sonny Perdue, the secretary of the US Department of Agriculture.The aid will be financed through the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation and will not require congressional approval, Perdue said. This obviously is a short-term solution that will give President Trump time to work on a long-term trade policyThe administration's action appeared to divide Republicans, with some praising the move and others troubled by what they view as the kind of widespread government-assistance program their party has traditionally opposed.'This trade war is cutting the legs out from under farmers and the White House's 'plan' is to spend $12 billion on gold crutches,' said Senator Ben Sasse, of Nebraska who frequently criticises the president, a fellow Republican.SHORT-TERM BOOST?Farmers have been a particular target in the current clash over trade policy as other countries seek to retaliate for Trump's duties on Chinese goods as well as on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico. Those affected economies have in turn targeted US agricultural products, including soybeans, dairy, meat, produce and liquor.The United States exported $138 billion in agriculture products in 2017, including $21.5 billion of soybeans, the most valuable export. China alone imported $12.3 billion of U.S. soybeans last year, according to the USDA.The size of the direct payments to farmers as a result of trade shortfalls would be unprecedented, said Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois.'We have never compensated farmers directly on such a large scale for retaliatory tariffs,' Irwin said.Blake Hurst, a corn and soybean farmer and president of the Missouri Farm Bureau, said that unless the White House's policies change, the US agriculture industry will continue to suffer.â€œThe payments will be helpful to farmers facing overdue loans and angry bankers, but are completely insufficient if they mean that tariffs and the trade war will last for the foreseeable future,' Hurst said. 'They are a very temporary bandage to a self-inflicted wound.â€?Later this week, Trump will visit Iowa and Illinois, two other farm-belt states, as he seeks to shore up support for Republican candidates in the US Midwest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cotton nearing harvesting dots a field in the Concho Valley.There's a Chinese proverb: Sow melons, reap melons. Sow beans, reap beans.In other words, expect tit for tat.President Donald Trump â€” and by extension many of the nation's farmers â€” is seeing that lesson in action after he launched a bevy of tariffs against China on Friday, prompting the People's Republic to retaliate with its own tariffs on imports from the United States. Among those American goods are some key Texas exports, including cotton, corn and sorghum. Some of the Chinese goods targeted in Trump's tariffs are vital parts for Texas' agriculture industry, such as livestock equipment.'No question, it's going to hurt,' said Gene Hall, a spokesperson for the Texas Farm Bureau.Throughout his presidential campaign and since he was inaugurated, Trump has threatened to amp up protectionist measures on the world's second-largest economy. It was a campaign issue that resonated with many Trump voters, including many Texas farmers.'We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S.,' Trump tweeted in April. 'Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!'On Friday, the United States levied tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods. China responded with its own tariffs on $34 billion in U.S. exports.The Chinese Ministry of Commerce called the United States a 'typical trade bully' set on igniting the largest trade war in history and violating World Trade Organization agreements.'Instead of serving the interests of U.S. companies and people, the move will prove to be counter-productive and damaging,' the Chinese commerce minister said in a statement.For Texas farmers, the trade war plays havoc with their bottom line. Tens of billions of dollars of goods trade between China and Texas each year. Texas exported $42 billion in goods to the country in 2017, second only to Mexico.Cotton is the state's 10th largest export. Nearly half of the U.S. cotton exported to China comes from Texas. Soy is a smaller market for Texas but China is the state's largest international soy customer. Texas exports about $157 million worth of corn a year, making it the 13th largest exporter of the crop in the country, though U.S. corn exports to China have dropped precipitously over the past few years due to increased regulations on the Chinese side.Wesley Spurlock, a corn farmer in Stratford and chairman of the National Corn Growers Association, said the weeks of talk of a trade war had already hurt Texas farmers. The prices of corn and soy have both decreased by around 15 percent since mid-May. The price of cotton has decreased by over 11 percent since mid-June. Spurlock credits those declines with the threat of tariffs, a situation that could be exacerbated with their enactment.Dee Vaughan, a corn and cotton farmer from the Panhandle, said even the threat of tariffs has caused shipping companies to be more hesitant buying his crop. Prices had already been low going into the spring, he said, though farmers were 'cautiously optimistic' about this year's revenues. But 'simply because of the uncertainty, if nothing else, all the rhetoric that's going on' for the past few months has been keeping farmers worried that they'll be able to make fewer sales.'You couldn't pick a worse time for agriculture to be in a trade dispute,' said Hall, the Texas Farm Bureau spokesperson pointing to a 50 percent decline in agricultural income since 2013. He said the farm bureau always supports negotiating trade disputes over gratuitous tariffs â€” but that many farmers hope the president's actions will force China, which has historically acted in ways that have harmed Texas agriculture, to the negotiating table.'There is some patience in the agricultural community for what the president's doing, but there is some angst as well,' Hall said.As China's middle class expands and demand for protein grows, soy has become essential in providing feed for the country's growing beef industry, Spurlock said. China imports more than half of American soybeans, and the United States is the second-largest soy exporter to China, representing about 34 percent of the country's soy imports. Spurlock fears the new tariffs will push Chinese consumers to look to other producers to get their soy, such as Brazil, which already accounts for more than half of all soy imports in China.The tariffs will also make agricultural equipment more expensive, but Spurlock said those rising costs are more of an inconvenience than a damning new expense. Vaughan echoed that sentiment, saying he is more concerned about not being able to sell his crop than the rising cost of farm equipment since he doesn't need to buy equipment very often.Though the agriculture industry will face a bitter few months with rising costs and damaged competitiveness, Spurlock said he hopes the tariffs work to improve and smooth trade between the United States and China, whose byzantine bureaucracy makes penetrating the market slow and cumbersome. If the tariffs work to bring China to the table to expedite trade allowing corn to become a major export to China, Spurlock said the United States could become the world's leading food producer.But when asked if he is optimistic the tariffs will work, Spurlock said, 'I have to be optimistic.'The Texas Tribune is a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans â€” and engages with them â€” about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.Read or Share this story: https://www.gosanangelo.com/story/news/2018/07/11/trade-war-china-worries-texas-agriculture/774225002/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Trump said Monday that the United States and Mexico have reached a new, 16-year trade deal with Mexico, focused largely on manufacturing.The White House and Mexican officials were unable to reach an agreement about the steel and aluminum tariffs Trump imposed several months ago, according to The Washington Post.Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump promoted the preliminary agreement with Mexico as a deal that could replace the North American Free Trade Agreement and threatened to hit Canada with auto tariffs if it did not â€œnegotiate fairly,â€? according to The New York Times.The National Marine Manufacturers Association, which called the progress â€œwelcome news, and an important step toward modernizing and preserving the trade pact,â€? advocated for the administration to continue to negotiate a deal with Canada.â€œThe agreement with Mexico is a positive step forward but the Administration needs to bring Canada on board to preserve NAFTA,â€? NMMA president Thom Dammrich told Trade Only Today. â€œAnd, there continues to be much work to be done to eliminate tariffs that are causing harm to many American industries.â€?Dammrich urged the administration to bring Canada, which is the industryâ€™s largest export market, back into the fold.â€œAdditionally, President Trump should leverage the goodwill created by this progress and work with both countries to resolve other trade disputes, especially retaliatory tariffs,â€? said Dammrich in a statement.Earlier this summer, Canada and Mexico responded to the administrationâ€™s Section 232 tariffs on aluminum and steel by applying punitive tariffs on U.S.-made products including boats.â€œAs a result, sales to both countries â€“ which collectively account for nearly half of U.S. boat exports annually â€“ have all but dried up,â€? said Dammrich.While pleased with progress on the agreement between the United States and Mexico, Dammrich said it was â€œpremature to celebrateâ€? the agreement as a major change in trade policy.â€œProud domestic industries like recreational boat manufacturing remain in the trade warâ€™s crosshairs and more work is needed to secure better deals for American workers and businesses,â€? said Dammrich. â€œWe urge the administration to swiftly and simultaneously finalize the trilateral NAFTA revamp and address other outstanding issues with key trading partners â€“ the 650,000 American jobs supported by our industry are counting on it.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mnuchin Says U.S.-China Trade War 'on Hold'WASHINGTONâ€”The worldâ€™s two biggest economies are pulling back from the brink of a trade war after making progress in talks aimed at bringing down Americaâ€™s massive trade deficit with China.â€œWe are putting the trade war on hold,â€? U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on â€œFox News Sunday.â€?After high-level talks Thursday and Friday, Beijing agreed in a joint statement with the U.S. to â€œsubstantially reduceâ€? Americaâ€™s trade deficit with China â€” but didnâ€™t commit to cut the gap by any specific amount. The Trump administration had sought to slash the deficit by $200 billion.Still, Mnuchin said that the two countries had made â€œmeaningful progressâ€? and that the Trump administration has agreed to put on hold proposed tariffs on up to $150 billion in Chinese products. China had promised to retaliate in a move that threatened a tit-for-tat trade war.Mnuchin said they expect to see a big increase â€” 35 to 45 percent this year alone â€” in U.S. farm sales to China. He also forecast a doubling in sales of U.S. energy products to the Chinese market, increasing energy exports by $50 billion to $60 billion in the next three to five years.Mnuchin said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has been part of the U.S. negotiating team, would soon be traveling to China to follow up on last weekâ€™s discussions.In Saturdayâ€™s statement, Beijing committed to â€œsignificantly increaseâ€? its purchases of American goods and services, saying the increase would â€œmeet the growing consumption needs of the Chinese people and the need for high-quality economic development.â€?Last year, the U.S. racked up a record $376 billion deficit with China in the trade of goods, largest by far with any nation.Trade analysts were not surprised that China refused to agree to a numerical target for cutting the trade gap, but they said the talks likely were more successful in de-escalating trade tensions.â€œThe Trump administration seems eager to engineer at minimum a temporary peace with China to ensure a smooth run-up to the Kim-Trump summit in June,â€? Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad said, referring to the June 12 meeting scheduled between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.If there is success in the U.S.-China discussions, analysts suggest it likely would involve the countriesâ€™ presidents this fall before the U.S. midterm elections.â€œPart of the good news for markets: as long as both sides continue to be â€˜constructivelyâ€™ engaged, imposition of additional tariffs by either side is very unlikely,â€? analysts at investment management firm Evercore ISI said in a research note. â€œThere is no reason for either side â€” particularly the U.S. â€” to destroy the process that both sides are building, which is what imposing tariffs would do.â€?Republican. Sen Lindsey Graham of South Carolina praised the Trump administrationâ€™s efforts with China.â€œItâ€™s smart to engage China on trade abuses, and it would also be smart to get them more involved in trying to help us with North Korea,â€? Graham said on â€œFox News Sunday.â€?Trump, a Republican, campaigned in 2016 on a pledge to get tough on China and other U.S. trading partners. He views the U.S. trade deficit with China as evidence that Beijing is engaged in abusive trading practices and has outmaneuvered previous U.S. administrations.Last August, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer began investigating Beijingâ€™s strong-arm tactics to challenge U.S. technological dominance. These include outright cybertheft of U.S. companiesâ€™ trade secrets and Chinaâ€™s demands that American corporations hand over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese markets.Last month, the Trump administration proposed tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports to protest the forced technology transfers. Trump later ordered Lighthizer to seek up to an additional $100 billion in Chinese products to tax.China responded by targeting $50 billion in U.S. products, including soybeans â€” a shot at Trump supporters in Americaâ€™s heartland. The prospect of an escalating trade war has shaken financial markets and alarmed business leaders.In a separate controversy, the Commerce Department last month blocked Chinaâ€™s ZTE Corp. from importing American components for seven years, accusing the telecommunications company of misleading U.S. regulators after it settled charges last year of violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea.The ban amounted to a death sentence for ZTE, which relies heavily on U.S. parts, and the company announced that it was halting operations. A week ago, Trump tweeted that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to put ZTE â€œback in business, fast.â€? Media reports suggested that the U.S. was offering to swap a ZTE rescue for an end to proposed Chinese tariffs on U.S. farm products.Speaking Sunday on CNNâ€™s â€œState of the Union,â€? Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called Trumpâ€™s intervention in the case â€œoutrageousâ€? and said that using ZTE â€œas a bargaining chip â€¦ is not in the best interests of our national security.â€?Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Sunday on ABCâ€™s â€œThis Weekâ€? that there could be â€œsome small changes around the edgesâ€? in the sanctions against ZTE. But Kudlow added: â€œDo not expect ZTE to get off scot-free. It ainâ€™t gonna happen.â€?___AP Business Writer Marcy Gordon contributed to this report from Washington.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The travel analysts reported year-on-year weekly bookings from China to the US during August were down by 8.4%, falling further as the latest rounds of what it branded â€œtit-for-tatâ€? tariffs have been announced by the US president.This drop was against a weekly bookings rise from China to the US of 2% from the last week of February (after the Chinese New Year holiday) to March 23, when the first of Trumpâ€™s tariffs took effect.Washington has imposed tariffs on $50bn (Â£40bn) worth of Chinese goods this year, in a bid to pressure US companies to bring production back to the US.Trumpâ€™s administration is threatening further tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.ForwardKeys, which predicts future travel patterns by analysing 17 million booking transactions a day, said the decision could cost the American tourism sector â€œdearlyâ€? this yearThe United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) puts total spending by Chinese tourists abroad at US$ 258 billion in 2017, while the WTTC reports the value of tourism to the US from international visitors amounted to $200.7 billion in 2017 - 8.6% of total exports.Trumpâ€™s tarrifs have also negatively impacting the Chinese yuan.The currency has fallen 7.5% against the US dollar since tariffs were introduced â€“ meaning touristsâ€™ money buys less, and warnings from Beijing about US travel security risks, have likely further influenced the trend, ForwardKeys said.Its data forecasting the rest of year outlines that Chinese outbound bookings to the US are 9.6% behind where they were at the same time last year, whereas Chinese outbound bookings worldwide are ahead by 5.5%.This pattern of â€œgrowth worldwide but slowdown to the USâ€?, ForwardKeys explained, was consistent in every month except October with the setback in October due to this yearâ€™s Mid-Autumn festival falling at the end of September, which draws departures at the start of the busy National Day Golden Week holiday into September from October.The biggest impact has been on bookings for group travel (defined as six or more passengers) from China to the US, currently behind for the rest of 2018 by 34.4% compared to last year.Bookings by free independent travellers (FIT) are behind 3.9%, with leisure travel being worse affected than travel for business or travel to visit friends and relatives.By way of a benchmark, Chinese bookings for travel to Canada were up 4.8% to the end of July and are currently ahead 8% for August to December.Olivier Jager, ForwardKeys chief executive and co-founder, said: â€œOur findings strongly suggest that President Trumpâ€™s trade war has had a significant impact on Chinese tourism to the US.â€œLooking at the year to date, we see a setback in Chinese tourism arrivals of just under 5%. If that continues to the end of the year, we estimate that the cost to the US economy will be north of US $122 billion in 2018.â€œChinese spending in this sector is significant â€“ it amounts to the largest category of US services exports to China. It is unquestionable that the Chinese appetite for visiting the US is diminishing, and that is bound to worry the US travel industry.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Supreme Court has adopted a new interpretation of Americansâ€™ right to vote: Use it or lose it.Ohio law allows state officials to strike voters from the rolls if they havenâ€™t cast a ballot in three consecutive federal elections and fail to return a single piece of mail. In a 5-4 ruling on Monday, the courtâ€™s five conservative justices upheld the law. â€œWe have no authority to second-guess Congress or to decide whether Ohioâ€™s (law) is the ideal method for keeping its voting rolls up to date,â€? Justice Samuel Alito, concluded for the majority in Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute. â€œThe only question before us is whether it violates federal law. It does not.â€?Voting-rights groups said the ruling would keep lower-income and disadvantaged residents away from the polls. â€œVoters should not be purged from the rolls simply because they have exercised their right not to vote,â€? Dale Ho, the director of the ACLUâ€™s Voting Rights Project, said in a statement. â€œThis ruling is a setback for voting rights, but it is not a green light to engage in wholesale purges of eligible voters without notice.â€?The ruling is a major victory for Republicans nationwide and could open the door to similar laws in other states. It also reifies efforts by GOP-controlled state legislatures to enact laws that make it harder for Americans to vote. Republicans typically defend these measures as necessary to combat voter fraud, but experts widely agree that fraud is rare. Many argue that the laws serve an altogether different purpose: preserving Republican electoral power by keeping disadvantaged and lower-income Americans away from the polls.At issue in Mondayâ€™s case was how Ohio maintains its voter rolls. Every state takes steps to maintain its list of eligible voters. Americans can lose their eligibility to vote by dying, moving to a new jurisdiction, receiving a felony conviction or some combination thereof. Ohio uses two methods to keep track of any changes. The first is to double-check voter addresses against the U.S. Postal Serviceâ€™s change-of-address database. If thereâ€™s a match, the state then mails a notice to the original residence and strikes the voter from the rolls if they donâ€™t reply or cast a ballot within four years.Federal election laws are designed to allow this method, and most states use some form of it. But Ohio takes it a step further. To find ineligible voters who didnâ€™t tell the Postal Service that they moved, the state also uses what it calls the â€œSupplemental Processâ€?: Election officials mail notices to voters who have gone two years without casting a ballot, changing their voter registration, or otherwise engaging in what the state calls â€œvoter activity.â€? If the voter doesnâ€™t mail back the notice and doesnâ€™t cast a ballot for the next four years, he or she is stricken from the rolls.Ohio officials first adopted the Supplemental Process in 1994 and carried it out every two years until 2014, when a lawsuit by the conservative legal organization Judicial Watch compelled the state to conduct it on an annual basis. In 2015, Ohio resident Larry Harmon, who hadnâ€™t voted since the 2008 presidential election, discovered he had been stricken from the voter rolls when he tried to cast a ballot in a state race. (State records say Harmon was sent a notice in July 2011, but he told the court that he doesnâ€™t remember receiving one.) Harmon, the A. Philip Randolph Institute, and the Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless filed a lawsuit in 2016 arguing that the stateâ€™s Supplemental Process violated federal election law.Under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, states canâ€™t use inactivity as the sole reason to remove a voter from the rolls. Ohio officials argued that this prohibition doesnâ€™t apply to the Supplemental Process because the state mails notices to voters before striking them from the rolls. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, finding that the process â€œconstitutes perhaps the plainest possible example of a process that â€˜result[s] inâ€™ removal of a voter from the rolls by reason of his or her failure to vote.â€?The Supreme Court sided with Ohioâ€™s interpretation of the law, overturning the Sixth Circuitâ€™s ruling. The Supplemental Process â€œdoes not strike any registrant solely by reason of the failure to vote,â€? Alito wrote. â€œInstead, as expressly permitted by federal law, it removes registrants only when they have failed to vote and have failed to respond to a change-of-residence notice.â€?That reasoning did not persuade the courtâ€™s four liberal justices. â€œOhio, of course, says that it has a ground for believing that those persons they remove from the rolls have, in fact, changed their address, but the ground is the fact that the person did not vote -- the very thing that the Failure-to-Vote Clause forbids Ohio to use as a basis for removing a registered voter from the registration roll,â€? Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in their dissent.In a separate solo dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor addressed the disparate impact that Ohioâ€™s law would have on the stateâ€™s electorate. Multiple organizations filed briefs with the court, she observed, to note that â€œthat the Supplemental Process has disproportionately affected minority, low-income, disabled and veteran voters.â€? One brief contended that 10 percent of voters in majority-black neighborhoods in Cincinnati had been removed for inactivity under the process.The impact can be substantial for those affected. â€œAt best, purged voters are forced to â€˜needlessly reregisterâ€™ if they decide to vote in a subsequent election; at worst, they are prevented from voting at all because they never receive information about when and where elections are taking place,â€? Sotomayor wrote.Other Republican-backed voter measures impose similar burdens. More stringent voter ID laws suppress black and Hispanic voter turnout, academic studies have consistently shown. Since voters from those groups tend to support Democratic candidates, Republican nominees typically reap the benefits.Brad Schimel, Wisconsinâ€™s attorney general, defended his stateâ€™s voter-ID law last month as a means to ensure Republican candidates would prevail. â€œHow many of your listeners really honestly are sure that Sen. (Ron) Johnson was going to win re-election or President Trump was going to win Wisconsin if we didnâ€™t have voter ID to keep Wisconsinâ€™s elections clean and honest and have integrity?â€? he asked a radio-show host during an interview last month. Trump won the state in 2016 by 22,000 votes.Sotomayor was careful not to single out any state laws that might come under future scrutiny from the court. But the breadth of her call to arms was unmistakable. â€œCommunities that are disproportionately affected by unnecessarily harsh registration laws should not tolerate efforts to marginalize their influence in the political process,â€? she wrote, â€œnor should allies who recognize blatant unfairness stand idly by.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though Trump's schedule was not public Monday afternoon, he will likely face questions from Iowa farmers who stand to lose millions of dollars this fall if the trade dispute with China is not resolved.'He's not going to come to Iowa and not hear about the impact of the trade dispute,' said Aaron Putze, a spokesman for the Iowa Soybean Association. 'There is a lot of angst in the agricultural community and rural America right now.'On July 6, China imposed $50 billion in tariffs on American exports, which includes a 25 percent tariff on soybeans. The move was retaliation for tariffs the United States placed on Chinese goods.Since the tariff was enacted, the price for American soybeans has dropped roughly 20 percent, said Chad Hart, an economist at Iowa State University. If prices do not rebound, Hart estimates Iowa soybean farmers will lose $624 million this year. Across the Midwest, economists at Purdue University estimate farmers' losses will exceed $3 billion.There is still time to save farmers from the bulk of these losses, Hart said. But only if China removes its soybean tariff before fall harvest time, when America's soybeans hit the market.'That's when potential losses become real losses,' Hart said.RELATED Midwestern farmers brace to lose billions in trade warAs harvest time steadily approaches, farmers are left with no option but to wait and hope that the two governments reach a resolution in time.For now, there are few signs of that happening.'There's been a lot of talk about the impact of the tariffs, but there's not been a lot of talk about how they're going to resolve it,' Putze said. 'And each day is one day closer to harvest season. Anxiety is rising.'If left unresolved, the long-term impacts of the Chinese tariff are difficult to predict, Hart said.'For individual farms, it's going to be a mixed bag,' Hart said. 'Some farmers have the financial reserves to weather this. For those already struggling going into this year, it will be harder to bear. This will force a few farmers out of business.'Nationally, the impact is even harder to predict.China is the world's single largest importer of soy, and it buys roughly 30 percent of all U.S. soybeans. The tariff, which is a tax Chinese buyers pay the government to purchase the commodity, ensures Chinese buyers will buy from other countries.'In the long term, this could cause anti-American sentiment to take root in China toward American agricultural products,' Putze said. 'If that happens, the impact of these tariffs could last a generation or two. So, let's resolve this now and get back to trading.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Wednesday trade negotiations should be prioritized over escalating a U.S.-China trade war with tariffs. File Photo by Stephen Shaver/UPI | License PhotoApril 4 (UPI) -- China urged the Trump administration to resolve trade tensions through negotiations and warned that countries like the United States could experience a 'bitter taste' with the escalation of tariff wars.The message came from Beijing's foreign ministry following the announcement of new retaliatory tariffs of up to 25 percent by China on imports from the United States that include U.S. agricultural products and metals.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Wednesday the 'door to dialogue' between China and the United States remains open, Xinhua reported.Geng also claimed China has made sufficient efforts to resolving trade disputes through dialogue, then warned the United States of the consequences of a trade war where both sides escalate tariffs.'China wishes each country enjoys the opportunity of development but if governments insist on protectionism it would be like closing the gates to China, and the experience of a bitter taste will follow,' Geng said, paraphrasing statements made by Foreign Minister Wang Yi.Geng also urged the U.S. government to listen to the voice of the American people.China's new tariffs appear to be targeting areas of the United States with an industrial base that may have supported Trump.The tariffs on U.S. steel could be targeting the Rust Belt, where Trump gained critical support in 2016 that helped him win the presidential election.China could be targeting the region ahead of U.S. midterm elections in November to weaken Trump's support base, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported Wednesday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"CLOSE The last time a trade war happened in the U.S., things didn't go well for the economy. Will history repeat itself as Trump puts a tariff on steel and aluminum? Here are the facts. Just the FAQsSteel mill in Baytown, Texas. (Photo: David J. Phillip/AP)The bullets are flying in the intensifying U.S. trade war with other global powers, and the casualties are starting to mount â€“ in layoffs, reduced worker hours and thinner company profits.While the damage has been limited so far, it would spread quickly if the Trump administration follows through on all its threatened tariffs, economists say. President Donald Trump significantly ramped up the fight Friday with fresh tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports.â€œThis is hurting the economy but so far itâ€™s manageable,â€? says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moodyâ€™s Analytics. â€œIf the war continues to escalate, it will do more damage and at some point it will undercut the good economyâ€? and trigger a recession.Trans-Matic, of Holland, Michigan, shapes metal, mostly into auto parts, as well as components for door locks. It has paid higher steel costs for several months as U.S. steelmakers raised prices in anticipation of higher American tariffs on metal imports, company Chief Financial Officer Steve Patterson says.More Money: Trump launches $34 billion trade war and China 'immediately' fires backMore Money: Trump vs. Red Hen restaurant: Eateries in Trump properties also dinged for violationsMore Money: June jobs report: U.S. economy adds 213,000 jobs but unemployment rises to 4%Trans-Matic has passed along the price hikes to its auto-supplier customers, but some have scaled back orders, reducing Trans-Maticâ€™s revenue in that key sector by 5 to 10 percent, Patterson says. As a result, the company is giving its 300 U.S. employees about five hours a week in overtime instead of their usual 10.â€œWhen you cut them back ... they get grumpy,â€? he says. And with a low unemployment rate creating a tight labor market thatâ€™s giving workers more leverage, Patterson worries Trans-Matic employees could bolt for competitors. â€œThis is all causing a bit of chaos,â€? he says.The U.S. last month slapped a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imported from Canada, Mexico and the European Union in an effort to combat what President Trump has called the dumping of those products in the U.S. below market prices. Those countries responded in kind. The EU imposed tariffs on $3.2 billion of U.S. goods, including bourbon, motorcycles and steel products. Canada has levied tariffs on billions of dollars of American metals, agricultural products and other goods. And Mexico is targeting U.S. products such as cheese, apples, blueberries, pork bellies and steel.More: Trump launches $34 billion trade war and China 'immediately' fires backMore: June jobs report: U.S. economy adds 213,000 jobs but unemployment rises to 4%More: Trump vs. Red Hen restaurant: Eateries in Trump properties also dinged for violationsThose duties followed U.S. tariffs in the spring on Chinese steel and aluminum imports and Chinese counter-tariffs on $3 billion in U.S. goods, including pork, fruit, ethanol and scrap aluminum.After the EU slapped a 31 percent tariff on motorcycles, iconic Harley-Davidson said it would move some production overseas, sparking a war of words with Trump.In Poplar Bluff, Missouri, Mid-Continent Nail, the nationâ€™s largest nail maker, laid off 60 workers last month. Sales plunged 70 percent after Trump placed a 25 percent tariff on steel from Mexico and Canada. When the company boosted its prices, customers defected. Now, Mid-Continent is strongly considering a second round of 200 layoffs, company spokeswoman Elizabeth Heaton says, and all 500 employees could be axed by Labor Day.CLOSE President Trump says the era of 'global freeloading' is over. He told rallygoers in Fargo, North Dakota, that his tariff standoff with China, the European Union and Canada is aimed at fixing his predecessors' 'disastrous trade deals.'

SEMO Box, a packaging company in Cape Girardeau, has said it will lay off four temporary workers because of the slowdown at Mid-Continent, according to Mid-Continent and The Associated Press. SEMO wouldnâ€™t comment.In Phoenix, Greg Hankerson, co-owner of Vintage Industrial, which makes custom steel furniture, says the 25-percent tariff on imported steel has boosted raw-material costs, which forced him to raise prices 5 to 10 percent earlier this year for various items, with more price hikes possible.In Wisconsin, Regal Ware, which makes cookware and small kitchen appliances, is getting dinged at both ends of the trade shootout. The West Bend company, with 200 U.S. employees, has paid $150,000 to $175,000 more for steel and aluminum as a result of the U.S. tariffs, says Doug Reigle, vice president of supply chain management. Itâ€™s absorbing part of that and passing along part in a 2.5 to 5 percent surcharge.Meanwhile, 65 percent of its revenue comes from overseas. Its products in Europe were hit with a 25 percent tariff last month, costing the company up to $2.5 million in sales, Reigle says. He says the company easily could have moved abroad but instead decided to stay in the U.S., investing $7 million in plant improvements the past five years.â€œWe kept jobs here, and I almost feel weâ€™re being punished for that,â€? he says.Elsewhere in Wisconsin, the dairy industry is reeling from $387 million in Mexican tariffs of 15 to 25 percent on U.S. cheese. Wholesale cheese and butter prices have slumped recently as buyers and sellers worry about the effects of the duties, says Pete Hardin, publisher of Milkweed, an industry publication.â€œWe are looking at a washout of 20 percent of Wisconsin dairy farm milk income on a monthly basis,â€? he says. â€œThatâ€™s how dangerous this mess is.â€?Thatâ€™s because dairy farmers have started cutting their prices to wholesalers to offset the higher tariffs, reducing their profits. The stateâ€™s farmers already were in trouble because of a milk surplus.Another round of 25 percent U.S. tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports took effect Friday and includes items such as medical devices, auto parts and industrial machinery.Those measures are aimed at fighting what administration officials say is Chinaâ€™s theft of U.S. intellectual property and its insistence that companies divulge valuable technology to enter Chinaâ€™s market. Beijing is lashing back with duties on American meat, seafood and SUVs, among other products. An additional $16 billion in tariffs, by both sides, are expected later this summer.Over the next year, all these tariffs are expected to translate into the loss of about 170,000 jobs and a tenth of a percentage point in economic growth, Zandi estimates. But Trump has threatened an additional $400 billion in tariffs on Chinese shipments to the U.S. and $275 billion in auto imports. Those would push total job losses to 700,000 and lop a half-percentage point of economic growth, likely nudging the country into recession, he says.Contributing: Rick Barrett of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Russ Wiles of the Arizona RepublicCLOSE The Milwaukee-based company blames retaliatory European tariffs in for moving some of their production overseas.

"CLOSE A former official at the U.S. Treasury department says the current tariff war between the United States and China is a threat to the global supply chain. (April 4) APPresident Trump waves to journalists after returning to the White House Thursday. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images)WASHINGTON â€” President Trump is upping the ante in his high-stakes trade dispute with China, proposing $100 billion in additional tariffs on Chinese goods â€” on top of the $50 billion in tariffs put forward just two days ago.The move comes a day after China responded in the back-and-forth trade war by matching Trump's proposed tariffs with $50 billion of its own, targeting small aircraft and soybeans.And late Thursday, Trump countered with instructions to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider using his authority under the Trade Act of 1974 to take additional actions against Chinese products.'In light of Chinaâ€™s unfair retaliation, I have instructed the USTR to consider whether $100 billion of additional tariffs would be appropriate under section 301 and, if so, to identify the products upon which to impose such tariffs,' Trump said in a statement Thursday night.Trump's directive merely begins the process of instituting sanctions, which begins with a 30-day review period in which the White House will seek public comments on the proposal.Still, the actions have raised fears of a wide-ranging trade war that could impact the agriculture, manufacturing and technology sectors.Trump's new economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, tried to reassure jittery markets Wednesday that Trump was only making plans to protect U.S. products â€” not firing the first salvos in a trade war.â€œThere is a process here, thereâ€™s going to be some back and forth, but thereâ€™s also some negotiations and we may talk about that, but thatâ€™s the key point,' he told Fox Business Network Thursday.Kudlow said previous presidents had complained about China's unfair trade practices, but Trump was 'the first guy with a backbone in decades' to do something about it â€” 'at least preliminary actions.'Trump said he also instructed Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue 'to use his broad authority to implement a plan to protect our farmers and agricultural interests.'U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, R-Neb., criticized the president's move. â€œHopefully the President is just blowing off steam again but, if he's even half-serious, this is nuts. China is guilty of many things, but the President has no actual plan to win right now. Heâ€™s threatening to light American agriculture on fire. Letâ€™s absolutely take on Chinese bad behavior, but with a plan that punishes them instead of us.

"China has added its voice to a growing chorus of concern about the rising threat of a trade war and tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to impose on steel and aluminum imports later this week.A top Chinese diplomat says that while Beijing does not want a trade war with Washington, it will defend its interests if necessary.Speaking at a press conference ahead of Chinaâ€™s annual legislative meetings, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui also gave assurances that the rise of worldâ€™s second largest economy and a rise in military spending was no cause for alarm.â€œChina does not want a trade war with the Untied States, but we will absolutely not sit idly by and watch as Chinaâ€™s interests are damaged,â€? Zhang said.Tit for tatLast week, the U.S. president announced plans to slap tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imports.China is a key country Washington is aiming to target with the tariffs, but the decision also has sparked a global backlash with leaders of other affected nations such as Canada and Europe, which are warning they, too, are prepared to take countermeasures.Analysts have said that if President Trump follows through on his pledges to get tough with China on trade, Beijing could respond by targeting the airline and agricultural sectors, even focusing on communities in the United States where support for the president was strong during the 2016 election.Zhang, who also is serving as the rotating spokesperson of the National People's Congress (NPC) said the best way to improve trade is to open up markets further and expanding the â€œpie of cooperation.â€?'If policies are made on the basis of mistaken judgments or assumptions, it will damage bilateral relations and bring about consequences that neither country wants to see,' Zhang said.Rising concerns about a trade war are likely to be a hot topic during the annual political meetings. Chinaâ€™s Premier Li Keqiang will deliver a government work report on Monday to the NPC during its opening session. That speech may highlight Beijingâ€™s concerns as it forecasts the government outlook for the economy in 2018.Moderate increaseThe report also will provide details about another closely watched item, Chinaâ€™s military spending.Zhang said China will see a moderate increase in its military budget this year, but argued that was to make up for a shortfall from previous years, upgrade equipment, and improve training and living conditions at the grassroots level for troops, among other reasons.Zhang did not say how much of a percentage increase China might see this year in its defense spending, but he stressed that the countryâ€™s military does not threaten anyone.Analysts tell VOA that spending could grow by about 10 percent, but they note that the real figure is perhaps much larger.â€œChinaâ€™s defense budget takes up a smaller share of its gross domestic product [GDP] and national fiscal expenditure than other major world countries. Its military spending per capita is also lower than other major countries,' he said.Last year, China disclosed that it spent nearly $165 billion on its military about one-fourth of what the United States plans to spend on defense this year.China modelDespite assurances, Chinaâ€™s broader strategic intentions are still something that Washington and other countries in the region watch closely.Under Xi Jinpingâ€™s leadership, China has begun assuming a bigger role on the global stage and has launched several initiatives of its own, including a massive trillion-dollar trade and infrastructure project called the â€œBelt and Roadâ€? initiative.During this yearâ€™s annual meetings, Chinaâ€™s communist party aims to solidify its self-proclaimed position as the only political organization qualified to rule the country, with the passage of 21 constitutional amendments.One key amendment in the package is a proposal to scrap restrictions regarding the number of terms the president can serve in office. The proposal paves the way for Xi to become Chinaâ€™s president indefinitely, although state media denies Xi will be granted tenure for life.When asked, Zhang did not respond to the question of whether the changes would give Xi lifelong tenure. He only said that the amendments would help unify the countryâ€™s leadership under Xi as Chinaâ€™s â€œcore leader.â€?The proposal, along with Chinaâ€™s growing ambitions to showcase what it calls the China model or 'China Solutionâ€? has led to concerns that Beijingâ€™s communist leaders will seek to spread their model of rule.Zhang said that each country has its own development path and model, and Beijing will not import models from other countries, nor will it export its own.â€œWe will not ask other countries to copy Chinaâ€™s practices, but of course if some countries are interested in learning Chinaâ€™s experiences and practices, we are ready and willing to share our experiences with them,â€? Zhang said.Zhang added that China will not impose anything on others and has no intention of overthrowing the existing international order or trying to start again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"President Donald Trump said Wednesday the United States is not in a trade war with China, after Beijing announced plans to impose tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods in response to a similar package announced by the United States.In a Twitter post Wednesday, Trump contended, â€œWe are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S.â€? He added, â€œNow we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!â€?On the same day, White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Bloomberg News, â€œNone of the tariffs have been put in place yet, and these are all proposals.â€?Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC, â€œEven shooting wars end with negotiations. ... So it wouldnâ€™t be surprising at all if the net outcome of all this is some sort of negotiation.â€?Tit-for-tat trade spatSince the start of this week, the United States and China have been engaging in a tit-for-tat trade spat. On Monday, in response to earlier tariffs on steel and aluminum imposed by the Trump administration, China started tariffs of up to 25 percent on 128 U.S. products, including fruits, nuts, pork, wine, steel and aluminum.Later the same day, the U.S. Trade Representatives (USTR) proposed to increase tariffs on 1,300 imported goods from China, mostly aerospace, medical and information technology products.Less than 12 hours later, China announced it plans to impose retaliatory duties of 25 percent on 106 politically sensitive American goods, including soybeans, automobiles and aircraft.The proposed list is now entering a â€œpublic notice and comment process, including a hearing,â€? the USTR said. After this process is completed, the USTR will issue a final determination on the products subject to the additional duties.Chinaâ€™s commerce ministry said the question of when the measures will go into effect will depend on when the U.S. tariffs become active.Chinaâ€™s Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai told reporters on Wednesday, â€œNegotiation would still be our preference, but it takes two to tango. We will see what the U.S. will do.â€?White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reiterated at Wednesdayâ€™s press briefing that this measure is now going through the review process, and â€œit will be a couple of months before tariffs on either side would go into effect and be implemented.â€?â€œWeâ€™re hopeful China will do the right thing. Look, China created the problem, not President Trump. Weâ€™re finally having a president whoâ€™s willing to stand up and say enough is enough, weâ€™re going to stop the unfair trade practices,â€? Sanders said.She also warned if China doesnâ€™t stop the unfair trade practices, the administration will move forward to the next step.Already in a trade warScott Kennedy, deputy director of the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he believes that the U.S. and China are already in a trade war.â€œIt started several weeks ago when the United States instituted penalties on Chinese steel and aluminum, and then the Chinese responded with penalties that also went into effect, so we havenâ€™t just put our guns on the table, weâ€™ve actually pulled the trigger. In the last few days, weâ€™ve announced additional tariffs that will come into effect in the coming weeks. If this isnâ€™t a trade war, I donâ€™t know what one is,â€? Kennedy told VOA.?Farming first to be hitAt the frontline of this war is Americaâ€™s farming industry.China, which buys nearly $20 billion in U.S. agricultural products annually, has become one of the most important export markets for U.S. farmers, but many agricultural products, including soybeans, cotton, frozen beef and sorghum, will be subject to tariffs if it goes into effect.American Farm Bureau Federation Policy Communications Director Will Rodger told VOA, â€œRight now, we export about 20 percent of what we produce. We are very, very dependent on exports. We are looking at 25 percent being placed on soybeans into China.â€œThe actual economic impact will not be good, it will certainly be bad, the question is how large itâ€™s going to be, we donâ€™t know exactly,â€? Rodger said.He said farm income is already at a 16-year low, resulting in many farmers in economic distress.â€œWhile we havenâ€™t reached the crisis point, we have one or two more years of declining income, we will be there pretty quickly,â€? he noted.Rodger said the current trade dispute is obviously not a good thing.â€œWe need it to stop, we need China and the United States to sit down and come up with a reasonable agreement in a reasonable fashion,â€? he added.Losses in the short termIf the tariffs go into effect, China trade expert Kennedy pointed out, there will be potential job losses by the reduced export opportunities, but the most important impact in the short term will be on the financial markets.Kennedy said the trade dispute between the U.S. and China is not about how fast this is resolved, but the way it is resolved.â€œThe issues the Trump administration has raised are issues American presidents have raised with China for almost two decades now, and not made the progress that they want. We shouldnâ€™t be looking for a quick deal and put this behind us, we should be ready for a sustained level of tension until China relents,â€? he said.Kennedy said China wonâ€™t do that easily.â€œChina has an economic governance system which is distinctive and critical to the way the Communist Party runs the country, so itâ€™s going to take a lot for them to move fundamentally,â€? he said.â€œThe two sides may make some type of short term deal to address superficially the challenges, but this is not something that will go away in the next few weeks,â€? Kennedy added.State Department correspondent Nike Ching contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Liang Liang is feeling a lot of stress lately. He owns an import wholesale business in Los Angeles.â€œI have been watching the news every day â€” when will the tariffs be put in place? When are my goods arriving; itâ€™s a fight against time. Iâ€™m trying to order all my products for the rest of the year,â€? he said. His goods, such as toys and T-shirts, come from China through the largest port complex in the United States, the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.He expects a 10 to 20 percent increase in shipping costs because of the trade war between the United States and China.Shipping costs likely to riseChina is the largest trading partner for both ports. As tariffs from both countries increase the cost of goods, manufacturers and retailers may order fewer products, which will cause a decrease in trade volume between the two countries, according to Stephen Cheung, president of the World Trade Center Los Angeles.â€œOnce that happens, youâ€™re going to see an increase in the rates for shipping because then you donâ€™t have the volume to justify the goods going back and forth,â€? he said.Cheung explained that shipping costs will affect all goods between the U.S. and China, not just the ones on the list to be taxed. He said the trade and logistics sector, which includes the ports and the supply chain of trucks and warehouses, will be the first to feel the effects of the trade war.Liang said he will absorb the cost and live with smaller profits, up to a point.â€œIf the tariffs increase by another 20 percent, weâ€™ll have to raise our prices,â€? he said.â€œThe consumers are going to feel it in their wallets very quickly,â€? Cheung said.?Supply chain may be less reliableThe U.S. as a manufacturing center depends on parts from China, but that supply may become less reliable as the trade war continues. Cheung said there may be uncertainty about whether the products will be produced or â€œwhether they will be in the same price, so this potentially can have a huge aspect in terms of our exporting capability not only to China but to the rest of the world, Cheung said. â€œAnd there are a lot of jobs that are tied to this,â€? he added.Officials at the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles said it is too early to tell the impact of the trade tariffs.â€œWeâ€™ll have to wait and see how various businesses restructure their supply networks and adjust to the tariff environment,â€? said Duane Kenagy, the Port of Long Beachâ€™s interim deputy executive director.He said so far, the port has seen record container volumes this year, but there is concern.â€œThe impacts of a sustained long-term trade war could be devastating to both economies,â€? Kenagy said.Political theater?Liang said he has hope, saying he thinks the trade war is actually political theater for the U.S. and China.â€œChina also has its position on trade. The Chinese government also has to be accountable to the 1.4 billion people of China. I think China and the U.S. will disagree over trade on the surface. (For Trump), itâ€™s a show for the November midterm elections, so he can be accountable to the electorate,â€? Liang said.Washington has been critical of Chinaâ€™s unfair trade practices and concerned with a trade imbalance. The U.S. imported more than $500 billion of Chinese goods last year compared to $130 billion of U.S. products exported to China.These concerns and issues of American intellectual property are reasons the Trump administration announced tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese imports.â€œIf youâ€™re utilizing this as a tactic, thatâ€™s fine. What are the steps that youâ€™re going to use to mitigate some of these damages that will be happening to the local community? These are huge issues that have not been addressed yet,â€? Cheung said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Director General of the World Trade Organization, Roberto Azevedo warns the global economy will run out of steam and millions of jobs will be lost if political leaders do not reach a negotiated settlement to end the trade war.WTO reports there has been a significant rise in protectionist measures since mid-October, with countries imposing an average of 11 restrictive trade measures every month.WTO chief, Roberto Azevedo says the major negative impacts resulting from trade restrictions should set off a few alarm bells.'It threatens the recovery of the global economy. It threatens growth. It threatens jobs,' said Azevedo. 'Our concern about anything is that this dynamic of an eye-for-an-eye or tit-for-tat or whatever you call it, it may be perceived as the new normal if countries begin to take this as a normal way of behaving.'He says this would be very harmful for the global economy down the road. Azevedo says the trade war is not a technical issue. It is a political situation, which he says will have to be resolved by political means.'So, leaders have to talk to themselves. At some point in time, they have to begin to listen to each other,' said Azevedo. 'It is not only also about responding. It is not only about making threats to each other. At some point in time, the question is going to beâ€”okay, so we have all these problems, how do we fix them?'That process appears to have begun. During a meeting Wednesday at the White House, U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission Chief Jean-Claude Juncker pulled back from the brink of an all-out trade war. They agreed to work together to lower tariffs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trump is on the verge of what may be the greatest escalation in his trade war with China yet.According to Bloomberg News, Trump instructed his aides to impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products, adding to the already $50 billion in place. And the announcement follows his threat last week to impose another $267 billion on Chinaâ€™s exports to the US.â€œI hate to say this, but behind that there is another $267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want,â€? Trump said on September 7.Itâ€™s now clear that what once started as a modest effort to change Americaâ€™s trading relationship with China has turned into a full-fledged assault on Beijingâ€™s economy.Trumpâ€™s move also comes at an inopportune time. Washington and Beijing were planning another round of talks on ways to end the trade spat. Itâ€™s possible, though, that the new tariffs will derail any chance of striking a deal in the near future.Many of the tariffs Trump imposed so far have mostly targeted high-tech Chinese products to put economic pressure on Beijingâ€™s â€œMade in China 2025â€? program â€” a Chinese government initiative to transform the country into an advanced manufacturing powerhouse, in areas like biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicles.But if he follows through on all his tariff threats, Trump will have placed levies on nearly every product China sends to America.That would almost certainly hurt the US economy in the future, too. Beijing usually retaliates with tariffs of their own on the same kind and amount of products American exporters send to China. That makes it even harder for US businesses to gain access to the Chinese market.In other words, Trumpâ€™s stated effort to bring back American jobs and strengthen Americaâ€™s private sector â€” all while trying to reduce the $31 billion trade deficit with China â€” may soon take a major hit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Trump may have just started a major trade war with countries around the world over steel and aluminum, and it sure looks like he doesnâ€™t know what heâ€™s gotten himself into.On Friday morning, the day after he announced his plan to impose a 25 percent tariff on all steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on all aluminum imports into the US, Trump boasted that his drastic actions would result in an easy win for the nation.â€œWhen a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,â€? he tweeted. â€œExample, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, donâ€™t trade anymore â€” we win big. Itâ€™s easy!â€?Thereâ€™s a lot to unpack in Trumpâ€™s tweet, but the overall message is pretty clear: The president doesnâ€™t seem to have a full grasp of whatâ€™s going on here.Itâ€™s peculiar â€” and worrying â€” that Trump labels trade wars as â€œgood.â€? A trade war is when two countries pursue tit-for-tat protectionism against each other â€” they take turns blocking the other countryâ€™s exports with tools like tariffs (border taxes) and quotas (caps on imports). If their actions against each otherâ€™s exports are big enough or go on long enough, they can have a devastating impact on each otherâ€™s economies: destroying businesses, increasing unemployment, and raising the price of vital goods in both countries.There is a legitimate debate over whether itâ€™s worth it for a country to set up specific tariffs to protect a beleaguered domestic industry (in this case, steel) and possibly risk a trade war with other countries.But few trade economists would say that a trade war is good or that it should be sought out; most think of trade wars as something to be avoided â€” or, at most, endured for the sake of protecting an industry that needs a helping hand from the government.Trumpâ€™s conviction that trade wars are â€œgoodâ€? seems related to his apparent belief that they are â€œeasy to win,â€? which is the most revealing part of his tweet. Itâ€™s certainly easy to start a trade war, but winning one isnâ€™t so straightforward.Thatâ€™s because countries can always find ways to retaliate â€” and there are already signs that countries are planning to do just that.Trump doesnâ€™t seem to realize that the US is very vulnerableâ€œIf the Americans impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, then we must treat American products the same way,â€? European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told the German press on Friday. Juncker specifically singled out Harley-Davidson motorcycles, bourbon whiskey, and blue jeans â€” all major American exports â€” for possible tariffs.If Europe hits those goods hard enough with huge tariffs, it could decrease demand for those products and cause job losses for the workers who make them. So Trumpâ€™s bid to make American steel great again could end up harming iconic American brands like Harley-Davidson and Jack Danielâ€™s Tennessee whiskey.Canada is also eyeing retaliatory measures. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Friday that restrictions on the flow of Canadian steel into the US were â€œabsolutely unacceptableâ€? and that Canada would take â€œresponsive measures.â€?Because so many countries â€” many of which are vital allies and major trading partners â€” export steel to the US, the US has a lot to fear in terms of possible retaliation. Mexico, South Korea, Japan, Brazil, and other countries that ship steel to the US could take aim at US exports to their countries.So why, then, did Trump make such a risky move?Part of the answer is that there seems to have been a shift in power among trade policy advisers in the White House. Since Trump took office, his administration has been split into two camps: one that favors free trade and is resolutely opposed to using tariffs to reboot American industries, and another that thinks tariffs are both good policy and good politics. Trumpâ€™s new tariffs are a sign that the free trade wing is losing.According to Politico, Trump announced the steel and aluminum tariffs after several weeks of rancorous debate between his advisers that one White House aide described as â€œabsolute chaos.â€? National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, the most prominent of the free traders, reportedly got into heated arguments with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, perhaps the most eccentric trade adviser and tariff advocate in the administration.Itâ€™s long been rumored that one of the main things keeping Cohn from leaving the White House was his desire to stop Trump from imposing tariffs on steel. Now that he seems to have lost that battle, he may be more likely to make an exit. That would, in turn, give the â€œAmerica Firstâ€? trade advisers in the White House a stronger grip over trade policy and could make other controversial tariff policies more likely in the months to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was just last week that US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the Trump administration was going to hold off on hitting China with punishing new tariffs as part of an effort to put â€œthe trade war on hold.â€?Flash forward to Tuesday and it seems like President Trump may be gearing up to launch a trade war between the worldâ€™s two largest economies after all.On Tuesday morning, the White House announced that it will proceed with plans to impose 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese exports to the US. The tariffs, or border taxes, are in response to Chinaâ€™s practice of forcing American businesses to hand over their signature intellectual property to Chinese companies if they want to do business in the worldâ€™s most populous country.The administration also announced that it will restrict Chinese investment in US companies and limit the number of goods that US companies can sell to China.The White House said the final list of Chinese goods that will be subject to tariffs will be announced on June 15, and that the measures will go into effect â€œshortly thereafter.â€?Trump has been bashing China since before his successful presidential run, so the tariffs donâ€™t come as a total surprise. Still, the timing of the move is raising eyebrows on both sides of the Pacific given that Mnuchinâ€™s comments had suggested the US was trying to lower tensions, not increase them further.Washington and Beijing are set to continue trade talks this week, and experts say that China could be confused by the apparent White House reversal. That, in turn, could lead Beijing to take a harder line during negotiations.Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the pro-trade Peterson Institute for International Economics, told me the new moves could loom over Commerce Secretary Wilbur Rossâ€™s upcoming trip to Beijing, where heâ€™s working on getting China to buy more American energy and agricultural products.â€œChina might no longer be so willing to go along,â€? Bown said.Trumpâ€™s possible trade war with China has been a long time comingIn April, the administration said it was weighing whether to levy tariffs on more than 1,300 Chinese exports, which included flat-screen televisions, aircraft parts, and medical devices. That would make them more expensive for American consumers and manufacturers.The Trump administrationâ€™s goal is to hit Chinaâ€™s more high-tech exports and damage Beijingâ€™s â€œMade in China 2025â€? program, a huge state-sponsored initiative to make China a world-class manufacturer of goods like robotics and high-end electronics.When Trump initially unveiled the tariff plan in April, China quickly threatened to respond in kind with tariffs on $50 billion worth of US exports to China, including cars, airplanes, and soybeans. The last one could deal a particularly serious political blow to Trump and his fellow Republicans: The biggest soybean producers in the US include Ohio, Iowa, Missouri, and Indiana â€” states in the heart of Trump country where neither the president nor his party wants to see economic instability or job losses during the 2018 or 2020 elections.On Wednesday, Beijing didnâ€™t issue that exact same threat, but suggested that a retaliation was on the table. â€œWe want to reiterate that we donâ€™t want a trade war, but we arenâ€™t afraid of fighting one,â€? Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters. â€œIf the US insists on acting arbitrarily and recklessly, China will take firm and powerful measures to safeguard its own legitimate rights.â€?Edward Alden, a trade expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, says itâ€™s worth noting that Trump has declined to announce an exact date for when the tariffs would go into effect â€” it seems thereâ€™s still a question of whether heâ€™ll actually go through with them.â€œThis appears to be the same tactic of using threats to gain leverage,â€? Alden told me. â€œBut so far, that approach has produced almost no tangible victories for Trump.â€?Trumpâ€™s surprise announcement on tariffs is in a way the opposite of another recent reversal: his bid to save the Chinese telecom giant ZTE.Hereâ€™s the backstory. In April, the Commerce Department banned US companies from selling parts or providing services to ZTE, which makes inexpensive smartphones, because it shipped equipment to Iran and North Korea in defiance of US sanctions. ZTE relies so much on components shipped from the US that the company immediately looked like it might go out of business.But a couple of weeks ago, Trump said he was looking into saving the company from collapsing, and on Friday he indicated that he had in fact reached a deal with the Chinese that will allow ZTE to stay alive by buying US parts again.Lawmakers in both parties have criticized Trump for trying to save ZTE, which they see as a huge concession to Beijing. They think his about-face on ZTE could hurt the USâ€™s credibility in negotiations, and theyâ€™re worried that ZTE could pose an espionage risk to the US by covertly using its cellphones for surveillance.Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers are in fact crafting legislation that could block Trumpâ€™s plan to save ZTE.Some analysts think that Trumpâ€™s tariff announcement on Monday might be an attempt to persuade Congress that heâ€™s not getting soft on China and to encourage lawmakers to drop efforts to put together blocking legislation on ZTE. Whether theyâ€™ll be convinced remains to be seen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trump announced yesterday that he would impose $50 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports. Now China has swiftly retaliated with promises to impose tariffs on US goods of the â€œsame scale and the same strength.â€?The US and China have been on the brink of a trade war for months as tensions between the two countries continue to rise over what the Trump administration characterizes as Chinaâ€™s â€œunfairâ€? trade tactics. The administration claims, among other things, that China forces foreign companies to spill American technology secrets in order to do business in their country.The administration announced on Friday that about $34 billion worth of Chinese goods will be subject to tariffs starting July 6. An additional $16 billion worth of products will be subject to further review and public hearings.China has said it would purposely enact tariffs that will affect American farmers and industrial workers in the Midwest â€” states that have large populations of Republican Trump supporters.The two countries were reportedly attempting to make amends in the past few weeks with discussions about a deal involving the additional purchase of up to $70 billion in American goods. But Chinese officials now say the compromise is â€œinvalid.â€?While itâ€™s still unknown which Chinese products will be hit with an import tax, it will likely include the list of 1,300 goods the Trump administration released in April with some modifications.And just last month, Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico, and the European Union; the move quickly created tensions and prompted retaliation from the US allies.Many US business leaders are worried about the potential negative impact of Trumpâ€™s tariffs. Tom Donohue, president and chief executive of the US Chamber of Commerce, told the Washington Post on Friday that â€œImposing tariffs places the cost of Chinaâ€™s unfair trade practices squarely on the shoulders of American consumers, manufacturers, farmers and ranchers. This is not the right approach.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"China seems to be positioning itself to deal with the fallout of a bruising trade war with the US.On Thursday, Chinaâ€™s commerce ministry announced that the country had agreed to lower or cancel existing tariffs, or border taxes, on thousands of goods from India, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Laos starting July 1.Trade experts say that the move is plain evidence that China is looking for alternative sources for goods that it imports from the US. China is currently planning on imposing sweeping tariffs on numerous goods from the US, retaliating against Trumpâ€™s tariffs on Chinese goods that are scheduled to begin next week.For example, China plans to lower tariffs on soybeans imported from those five Asian countries â€” all of which are party to the Asia Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA). That should help Chinese consumers find alternatives to soybeans imported from the US, which are going to become much more expensive when China hits them with tariffs.â€œThereâ€™s no question that China is preparing for a trade war,â€? Edward Alden, a trade scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, told me.China is currently planning on placing tariffs on $34 billion worth of US goods in response to Trumpâ€™s plan to hit $34 billion in Chinese goods with tariffs next week. Beijing is attempting to dissuade Trump from considering additional tariffs in the future by matching the scale of the USâ€™s first batch of them.While China and its Asian trading partners began to work on an agreement before the recent escalations in trade tensions between the US and China, analysts say the timing of the announcement is politically charged.Chinaâ€™s plan to impose tariffs on soybeans is going to hit the US hard. China buys about a third of the USâ€™s soybean exports, making it far and away the largest importer in the world for the American crop. The biggest soybean producers in the US include Ohio, Iowa, Missouri, and Indiana â€” states in the heart of Trump country where neither the president nor his party wants to see economic instability or job losses in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, or the 2020 elections.Experts say that Chinaâ€™s move will also help it foster closer ties with its neighbors at a time when US influence in the region is ebbing.â€œThese tariff cuts will also help to strengthen Chinaâ€™s relations with its Asian neighbors, even as the United States has turned its back on the region economically, by walking away from the TPP,â€? Alden told me.Trump pulled out of the TPP â€” a free-trade agreement with 11 other Pacific Rim countries â€” in his first week in office. At the time, trade analysts feared that China, which was not a member of the agreement, would have a unique opportunity to consolidate power in the region. That seems to be exactly whatâ€™s happening.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Trumpâ€™s aggressive trade policies could punish his most committed supporters, according to an updated analysis from the Brookings Institution.The centrist, Washington-based think tank projects that more than 1 million jobs in over 2,600 counties across America that voted for Trump in 2016 could suffer in a trade war with China that began in earnest on Friday. Nearly 564,000 jobs in just under 500 counties that supported Democrat Hillary Clinton two years ago are threatened.â€œThe U.S. soybean industryâ€™s worst fears are coming to pass today with the implementation of tariffs on Chinese imports,â€? the Iowa Soybean Association said in a statement. â€œThis aggressive action positions Iowa and Americaâ€™s soybean farmers directly in the crosshairs of a full-scale, multi-national trade war if China, as it has promised, imposes tariffs on U.S. soybean imports.â€?Trump defeated Clinton in Iowa by close to 10 percentage points. Almost 51,000 jobs could be adversely impacted in the battleground state if Trumpâ€™s effort to negotiate more favorable trading terms with China spins out of control and results in a war of escalating tariffs on a broad range of exports from both countries.Republicans in Congress have for months been concerned that they could pay the price for Trumpâ€™s trade policies in the midterm elections, fretting that a tit-for-tat tariff battle with Beijing will undercut a strong U.S. economy that in June produced 213,000 jobs and an significant uptick in the number of Americans who joined the labor force.Trump has dismissed those concerns, claiming that the U.S. economy has little to lose from a trade war. His theory will be tested after he slapped $34 billion in higher tariffs on Chinese imports and Beijing responded with $34 billion in new tariffs on U.S. imports. Among the affected U.S. exports are soybeans. Nationally, soybean farmers export 60 percent of their crop, about $14 billion annually, to China.Agriculture stands to be hard hit, but it isnâ€™t the only sector of the American economy concerned about Trumpâ€™s trade policies. Manufacturing, the industry that Trump said stands to benefit the most, also is concerned. Brookings first analyzed the potential impact of a trade war with China in the spring, after Trump threatened steep tariffs if Beijing didnâ€™t agree to better terms for American products.Yet many in the line of fire are hesitant to speak out, worrying that doing so could incite retaliation from the president, as experienced by Harley Davidson after the Wisconsin motorcycle manufacturer responded to threats of a trade war with the European Union by moving some manufacturing overseas.â€œWe now have an unparalleled opportunity to stop these practices at their root, through a strategic approach that includes the negotiation of a fair, bilateral, enforceable, rules-based trade agreement by an administration that champions manufacturing,â€? National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons said in a statement.â€œTariffs, though, have not and will not solve the existing problems in China,â€? he added. â€œTariffs will bring retaliation and possibly more tariffs. No one wins in a trade war, and it is Americaâ€™s manufacturing workers and working families who will bear the brunt of continued tariffs.â€?Senate Republicans are positioned to pick up seats in the midterm elections, despite an otherwise tough political environment for the GOP. The Democrats are defending nearly 10 seats in states won by Trump in 2016, about half of which continue to strongly support the president.But if Trumpâ€™s aggressive trade tactics boomerang, voters could revolt, at least many Democrats believe so. Targeted Senate races are in states like Indiana (60,000 jobs impacted); Missouri (40,000); Montana (2,300); North Dakota (7,600) and Ohio (58,000), states with significant agriculture and manufacturing industries dependent on international trade, some with China, some with other countries.Other states, like Iowa, could see reverberations in competitive House races.Republican Mike Naig, Iowaâ€™s elected secretary of agriculture, didnâ€™t mince words on his concern about the effect Trumpâ€™s trade policies are having on his state.â€œThe continued escalation of trade tensions with China is having a real impact on Iowa farmers and businesses. We have seen a significant drop in prices for both crops and livestock and this is creating even more stress and uncertainty during what was already a difficult time for the ag economy,â€? Naig said in a press release.â€œThere are real issues in our trade relationship with China that need to be addressed, but Iowa agriculture cannot continue to bear the brunt of the retaliation from our trading partners.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Orrin Hatch said in a statement.'When it comes to unfairly traded steel and aluminum, Mexico, Canada, and Europe are not the problem â€” China is,' Rep. Kevin Brady said of the tariffs, echoing Hatch.

Mnuchin said in an interview with CNBC Friday afternoon.â€œThere is a level of risk that we could get into a trade war,â€? he repeated.The two countries have traded escalating threats of tariffs this week, with Trump calling Thursday evening for his trade representative to explore tariffs on an additional $100 billion of Chinese imports on top of the $50 billion he already proposed.The objective isnâ€™t a trade war, Mnuchin said, but rather free and fair trade, and Trump is prepared to defend U.S. interests.Asked directly if there are ongoing negotiations with Chinaâ€™s government about reaching an agreement to defuse the situation, Mnuchin hedged, saying he didnâ€™t want to negotiate in public.â€œWe are willing to negotiate; we are in communication with them regularly,â€? he said.For his part, Trump has welcomed the prospect of a trade war, musing on Twitter that it would be easy to win.Meanwhile, his top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, downplayed the threats of tariffs earlier Friday, suggesting that there was plenty of time to negotiate and avoid retributive taxes.â€œThis has been very well organized,â€?

"The head of global leader Koch Industries on Wednesday urged the Trump administration to call off its trade war with China and others, warning that it could sink the U.S. economy and give rise to socialism that hurts workers.In an exclusive interview, Charles Koch said, â€œthe less trade we have the worse everybody is. I mean, the less exports we have the less imports we have and that makes us worse off. And the more we isolate ourselves, the less we learn of improvements and developments and innovations around the world.â€?And, he warned, â€œIf goods donâ€™t cross borders soldiers will and we see that now in this trade war. Itâ€™s just creating more animosity and it could escalate.â€?Koch has been a leading pro-trade voice even when it hurts his companies. For example he recently penned a column for the Washington Post in which he decried President Trumpâ€™s trade tariffs on steel. Koch is a major steel producer.â€œWeâ€™re working hard against all these other protectionist trade barriers that are just different forms of corporate welfare which, other than a few special interests, will make Americans worse off,â€? he told Secrets.Our founder, Charles Koch, on why he is working to eliminate cronyism and why tariffs 'will only perpetuate the rigged system that threatens the very core of our society.' https://t.co/Od5pQUKqQg â€” Charles Koch Inst. (@CKinstitute) March 8, 2018Koch, chairman of the board and chief executive of Koch Industries, called cashing in on export tariffs and walls a â€œcancerâ€? on the nation that has to be avoided.Itâ€™s â€œa cancer on society,â€? he said, when business pushes a policy of â€œletâ€™s rig the system so that we can make a quick buck.â€?A student of philosophy and history, Koch said in the telephone interview from his Wichita, Kan., HQ that he worries that expanding trade barriers and tariffs will hurt the country. He cited several nations, including the former Soviet Union and China, that became â€œthird worldâ€? after imposing isolationist policies.And he fears that younger Americans are getting a skewed view of capitalism.â€œCorporate welfare and cronyism is, I think, a contributing factor to so many young people being socialists because if the government is going to determine who succeeds in business, who needs the business people. Just let the government do it. So I think itâ€™s suicidal for long term,â€? said Koch.Trump and his commerce secretary have championed the new tariffs on China as an attempt to make trade more fair. Koch said that he has not had discussions with the White House on the issues.However, he said that some lawmakers have used his Post column to urge fewer tariffs. It has also sparked a lively debate on right-leaning talk radio where many of the presidentâ€™s tariff policies have come under fire because of the resulting counter tariffs that have hit small industries in America.Instead of punching and counterpunching, Koch held out his companyâ€™s philosophy as a model.â€œA key element in that is not having protectionism in any of its forms but creating what we call virtuous cycles, that is continuing learning and improving and creating value for others, and thatâ€™s a way you're successful and thatâ€™s how our company has been successful. Developing capabilities so we can create value for others and do it in a way that weâ€™re compensated obviously or we wouldnâ€™t be successful. So itâ€™s what we call a philosophy of mutual benefit, and thatâ€™s what trade is,â€? he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Trump delivers a joint statement with Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, at the White House on July 25. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)Hear that sigh of relief on Wall Street?At first glance Wednesday, it looked as if President Trump halted his trade war. Trump hosted European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the White House, and the two happily announced a â€œdealâ€? on trade. Europe agreed to buy more soybeans and liquefied natural gas from the United States, and Trump agreed not to put any more tariffs, for now, on the E.U. Traders cheered the news, sending the stock market higher.But there are a lot of reasons to be skeptical that Trump has suddenly changed his mind on trade. The details of the agreement with Europe are thin, thereâ€™s still a trade deficit that Trump hates, and only a day ago the president tweeted that â€œtariffs are the greatest.â€?1. Thereâ€™s still a trade deficit. Trump detests the U.S. trade deficit with Europe, China and the rest of the world. All those deficits still exist. While Juncker vowed that the E.U. would purchase more soybeans and liquefied natural gas, he canâ€™t command private companies to do that. He doesnâ€™t have the same power the Chinese president does. Furthermore, itâ€™s unclear whether those additional purchases would put much of a dent in the $101 billion trade deficit the United States ran with the E.U. in 2017.The trade deficit means that U.S. consumers bought more from Europe than vice versa. Trump is focused on bringing the trade deficit down, but the vast majority of economists donâ€™t view it as a problem. The U.S. economy has continued to grow and add jobs despite the long-running deficit.2. Trumpâ€™s metal tariffs are still in place. The carefully worded U.S.-E.U. statement Wednesday says the two sides â€œwant to resolve the steel and aluminum tariff issues.' But the fact remains that Trump still has a 25 percent tariff on European steel and a 10 percent tariff on European aluminum. Beyond Europe, Trumpâ€™s metals tariffs are still in place on many other countries, including such allies as Canada and Japan.3. Tariffs are moving forward on China. Europe may have gotten a breather Wednesday, but China did not. Nearly half of the tariffs Trump has put in place so far are on Chinese products (the total is about $37 billion). On top of that, the Trump administration is pushing ahead with tariffs on another $16 billion of Chinese goods and has started the process for tariffs on another $200 billion. In recent days, Trump has repeated threats to put tariffs on all items the United States buys from China (roughly $500 billion). All of this comes as trade talks with the country have stalled.4. The â€œdealâ€? with Europe looks odd. This is an agreement to make a deal at some point down the road. And thereâ€™s a lot to work out, even on the basics. Trump said Europe would be a â€œmassive buyer of LNG,â€? but it isnâ€™t clear how that will happen. Liquefying natural gas, shipping it across the Atlantic in special tankers and turning it into gas again is costly. Russia, which has very low gas production and pipeline costs, can easily undercut U.S. LNG. Thatâ€™s why European facilities for re-gasifying LNG are operating at about a quarter of capacity. And new pipelines will deliver natural gas from the Caspian Sea to Southern Europe and from Russia to Germany. â€œThe United States is putting a ceiling on the price of gas in Europe,â€? Total chief executive Patrick PouyannÃ© said in a recent visit to Washington. But that doesnâ€™t necessarily translate into massive sales.Furthermore, the vows that Trump and Juncker made to work toward zero tariffs and zero subsidies on industrial goods looks a lot like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a deal negotiated by the Obama administration that Trump had previously pushed aside. Is Trump really ready to embrace it now when the only major change is for Europe to buy more soybeans?5. The auto tariff investigation is moving forward. The E.U. claims that it succeeded in getting Trump to back down on putting auto tariffs on Europe â€” for now. But that point didnâ€™t make the official statement, and the Trump administration is still moving ahead with its investigation into whether other countries are hurting the United States' â€œnational securityâ€? by bringing in so many foreign cars, trucks and parts. The investigation is likely to take several more weeks. By the time itâ€™s done, Trump could easily change his mind. His top economic advisers indicated this week that the president was still keen to put 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of autos and parts.6. Trump has a tendency to go soft, then hard, on trade. The world saw a similar playbook when Trump unveiled the steel and aluminum tariffs in March. Early on, he exempted numerous countries, including the European Union, from the tariffs. Many experts and Wall Street traders saw this as a sign that Trump wasnâ€™t as gung-ho about tariffs as his rhetoric suggested. But they were later stunned when Trump went ahead and put the metals tariffs on U.S. allies June 1.Trump has also gone hot and cold on China. Remember when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration was putting the tariffs with China â€œon holdâ€? only to have Trump forge ahead a few days later? Or when Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau praised each other at a news conference at the Group of Seven summit, and then Trump blasted Trudeau as â€œmeek and mildâ€? after they left? Trump often seems to like to lure people to the table to see what they will offer before hitting them hard again for more.Related:One important group supports Trumpâ€™s auto tariffsTrump voters hit hard by tariffs are standing by him â€” for now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump waves during joint statements with China's President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, November 9, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo (Thomas Peter/Reuters)President Trump said Friday that he is ready to impose tariffs on $267 billion in Chinese goods, on top of the additional $200 billion that he said will likely be hit with import taxes in a matter of days.If eventually carried out, Trumpâ€™s latest threat could result in tariffs on all Chinese goods entering the United States, an unprecedented escalation of his trade war with China.The U.S. in July began imposing tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese industrial imports as Trump moved to confront Beijing over a range of policies that have long vexed American leaders.'Weâ€™ve taxed them $50 billion â€” thatâ€™s on technology,â€? the president told reporters aboard Air Force One. â€œNow weâ€™ve added another $200 billion. And I hate to say that, but behind that, thereâ€™s another $267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want. That totally changes the equation.'Stocks dipped after Trump's comments became public but recovered most of their losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down about 77 points or 0.3 percent in mid-afternoon trading.The tariffs that Trump has imposed, and threatened to impose, total $517 billion -- more than the $505 billion in Chinese goods that entered the country last year. The president says the tariffs are needed to force China to stop stealing U.S. technology and coercing American companies to surrender their trade secrets in return for access to the Chinese market.It's not clear why the president cited the specific figure he used. The White House did not reply to a request for comment.So far this year, U.S. imports from China are running roughly 8 percent higher than during the same period in 2017. If that pace continued for the remainder of this year, Chinese imports would top $548 billion -- leaving Trump a bit short of complete coverage of Chinese goods.The office of the U.S. trade representative Thursday finished accepting comments on the next round of tariffs, which could hit up to $200 billion in Chinese products any day. Many products purchased by consumers, such as refrigerators, spark plugs and furniture, are among the potential targets.Trump's decision to double-down on his uncompromising stance toward China means little chance of an early resolution of the standoff between the world's two largest economies. Additional U.S. tariffs are certain to trigger Chinese retaliation, though China's smaller volume of American imports means that it can't match Trump's tariffs on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Chinese officials may respond by subjecting American companies operating in China to unexpected tax audits, custom inspections or even consumer boycotts.'The end game in the U.S.-China trade war has now become even more difficult to discern as both sides step up their attacks and counter-attacks,' said Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad, former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. 'Trumpâ€™s remarks confirm his intention to continue escalating trade sanctions until China capitulates, and China has equally clearly signaled it has no intention of doing so.'Aboard Air Force One, the president cited the suffering Chinese stock market as an indication that the U.S. is winning the trade conflict. The Shanghai market is down roughly 23 percent in dollar terms so far this year while the Dow has risen nearly 5 percent.'China is moving lower in their economy. The U.S. is moving higher,' Lawrence Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said on CNBC. 'We're the hottest place in the world.'Despite several rounds of talks between U.S. and Chinese officials, the two countries have made little progress toward resolving their differences. Chinese diplomats complain that the Trump administration lacks a single negotiator empowered to make a deal and is vague about its objectives.But Kudlow said the U.S. goals are clear. 'Lower barriers, open markets, quit stealing IP and technology,' he said, using an abbreviation for intellectual property. 'These things are not hard.'As the president readies additional anti-China trade barriers, some economists worry about the economic toll. An intensified trade war would likely hurt the U.S. more than China, according to S&P Global Ratings. By 2021, based on IMF economic forecasts, the U.S. would lose about 1 percent of its annual output or about $230 billion while China would lose 0.6 percent of its $18 trillion economy that year or $110 billion.'The direct economic effects of the U.S.-China tariff dispute have so far been limited. That may be about to change,' wrote S&P economist Satyam Panday.Some business groups greeted the president's latest tariff threats with dismay. â€œThe notion that the president is going to add an extra $267 billion worth of tariffs is grossly irresponsible and possibly illegal,' said Jose Castaneda, spokesman for the Information Technology Industry Council, which argues that the tariffs are not permitted under U.S. trade law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Donald Trump meets Chinaâ€™s President Xi Jinping as he arrive for the state dinner with the first ladies at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Nov. 9, 2017. Trump is closing in on a decision to impose punishing tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese goods as early as June 15. (Thomas Peter/AP)President Trump on Friday will announce a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion of Chinese products, the latest move in his intensifying campaign to rewrite the rules of global trade.The action will come one day after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Beijing for talks with Chinese leaders about the presidentâ€™s recent meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.The tariffs, which Trump set in motion in March, are a response to Chinaâ€™s practice of compulsory technology licensing for foreign companies and its efforts to steal U.S. trade secrets via cybertheft, administration officials have said.The president has blamed China for the loss of 60,000 U.S. factories and 6 million American jobs, numbers most economists regard as including the effects of increased manufacturing automation. He has identified reducing the $375 billion annual trade deficit with China as a key test of his â€œAmerica Firstâ€? trade strategy.Although the import levies affect less than 10 percent of the $505 billion in Chinese goods that Americans buy each year, Trumpâ€™s new trade barriers mark a historic change after three decades of deepening ties between the worldâ€™s two largest economies.The administration initially said that up to 1,300 products could be hit with the tariffs, which American importers pay and pass on to their customers.Some new products will replace some original items on the list to be announced Friday. As a result, not all of the tariffs will go into effect at the same time, allowing for public comment on the new goods.Robert E. Lighthizer, the presidentâ€™s chief trade negotiator, has said that the tariff list would be designed to minimize the impact upon consumers.Trump has resorted to tariffs with an enthusiasm not seen in an American president in at least 80 years. His import taxes on steel and aluminum have drawn protests from companies that use foreign-made metals, farmers who fear U.S. trading partners will retaliate against them and Republicans in Congress.But his plan to crack down on China has drawn wider support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Soybean farmer Michael Petefish stands inside a bin with soybeans at his farm near Claremont in southern Minnesota on July 18. (Jim Mone/AP)DemocracyPost contributorWhen Robert Zimmerman grew up in Hibbing, Minn., the areaâ€™s politics were as deep blue as the waters of Lake Superior to the east. The nearby taconite mines churned out iron ore, and the miners reelected left-leaning congressmen like clockwork.Zimmerman grew up and left his hometown (and his name) behind to become Bob Dylan. And at a time of dramatic political change, he wrote his most famous lyric: â€œThe times they are a-changinâ€™.â€?As President Trump rumbles into Minnesota for a rally on Thursday night, those words again apply to Dylanâ€™s home state. Republicans have long seen Minnesota as a key target. Trump nearly won the state in 2016 and would have been the first Republican to do so since Richard M. Nixon. But Trumpâ€™s endless scandals, his bullying brand of politics and his trade-war folly are giving Democrats a political gift in a swing state that Republicans need to win in the upcoming midterms.Because of Al Frankenâ€™s resignation in January, Minnesota has two U.S. senators on the ballot this year. Both are incumbents from the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (Minnesotaâ€™s version of the Democratic Party). But perhaps more astonishing is the fact that four of Minnesotaâ€™s eight congressional districts are competitive. Two red seats are likely to turn blue, but two blue seats could also turn red â€” a tectonic shift triggered by Trump that demonstrates how he has redrawn conventional political lines.Around Hibbing, in Minnesotaâ€™s 8th Congressional District, Republicans have one of their best opportunities to flip a Democratic seat. Many mines have gone dormant. The Main Streets of Virginia, Eveleth and Aurora used to be thriving; now the median age in the district has skyrocketed and the bustle has turned to bust. The region is dotted with shuttered storefronts, antique shops and dive bars. And for those who feel nostalgia for the boom times, the notion that Trump could make Minnesotaâ€™s Iron Range Great Again â€“ with a Hail Mary trade war â€“ is alluring. Everything else failed. Why not give Trump a shot? The race is considered a toss-up.But as the Trade War giveth, it also taketh away. Trumpâ€™s rally is being held in Rochester, Minn., the economic anchor of the 1st Congressional District. The incumbent vacating the seat, Tim Walz, is a Democrat now running for Minnesota governor. But with the seat open, the districtâ€™s fundamentals favor Republicans: Most of the district is rural, 90 percent white and comparatively affluent (partly thanks to the 35,000 employees of the world-renowned Mayo Clinic health-care hub in Rochester).Even so, Trump has given Democrats better odds. His signature health-care proposal was opposed by the medical community. High education levels in the district favor Democrats too, as college-educated white people tend to have negative opinions of Trump.Even more striking are the political shifts underway among farmers in the district, as Trumpâ€™s quixotic trade war begins to tilt soybean farmers along the Iowa border against Trump.â€œThe trade war is really doing long-term damage to our farmers out here,â€? Gary Wertish, president of the Minnesota Farmers Union, recently told me. â€œSoybeans is the big one â€” the price has fallen approximately a couple of dollars a bushel; itâ€™s been about a 20 to 25 percent reduction since Trump started the trade war with China.â€? Worse, the steel tariffs (that miners in Minnesotaâ€™s 8th Congressional District are celebrating) are hitting farmers hard in equipment purchasing and repairs. As Wertish put it: â€œFarmers are getting squeezed on both ends.â€?Trumpâ€™s cynical attempt to provide a one-time payment to farmers isnâ€™t cutting it either. â€œThe amount of money that theyâ€™re proposing is not even close to what the tariff wars have cost farmers,â€? Wertish added. He worries that the export markets that Minnesotaâ€™s farmers have cultivated for decades could disappear permanently, even if the trade war ends soon. And Wertish warns that family farmers and younger farmers may be forced out of agriculture â€” even after they â€œget their crop in the binâ€? â€” if they canâ€™t pay their bills because of Trumpâ€™s trade war.As a result, a district that would normally favor Republicans in this cycle is now a toss-up. Trump may have thrown away an easy GOP pickup.At the same time, Trump has given Democrats a huge political gift in the suburbs of Minneapolis and St. Paul, particularly in the Republican-held 2nd and 3rd Congressional Districts. Due to Trump, â€œthe Twin Cities and the suburbs are boiling over with progressive energy,â€? according to Jeff Blodgett, a leading Democratic-Farmer-Labor strategist. â€œThe changing politics of the suburbs is going to dominate what happens here in 2018 and beyond.â€? Trump has alienated huge swaths of historically Republican voters in each district. Both the 2nd District and the 3rd District are now considered â€œlean Democraticâ€? by the Cook Political Report.Trump might fire up the crowd at his rally, but his visit will certainly fire up Democrats in the suburbs. If energized Democrats manage to win two longtime Republican suburban strongholds and can hang on in the rural 1st District and the 8th District, they will make serious headway on the path to taking back control of the House.Of course, a lot can happen between now and November.As Bob Dylan reminds us: â€œAnd donâ€™t speak too soon / For the wheelâ€™s still in spin / and thereâ€™s no tellinâ€™ who that itâ€™s naminâ€™ / For the loser now will be later to win / For the times they are a-changinâ€™.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite warnings from key allies, members of his own party and economic experts, President Trump further escalated his tariffs confrontation with China by ordering his chief trade negotiator to consider imposing tariffs on an additional $100 billion of products.China, in return, said it didn't want a trade war but was ready to fight Trump's policies â€œat any cost.â€?While the U.S. move late Thursday may not lead to a full-blown trade war, the tit-for-tat has raised the stakes of a conflict that is worrying Europe, Japan and American business leaders alike.While Trump argues that his tariff plan is necessary to rein in China's trade practices, his critics blame the president for risking a trade confrontation that could easily get out of hand. Here's how we got to this point.March 1: Trump first announces steel and aluminum tariffsSpeaking at the White House, Trump makes a first statement on his plans to impose punishing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. The president says he has decided on tariffs of 25 percent for foreign-made steel and 10 percent for aluminum, making no exceptions for close allies such as Canada, Britain or Germany.The president then takes to Twitter to explain his decision. â€œWhen a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,â€? he argues. â€œExample, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, donâ€™t trade anymore-we win big. Itâ€™s easy!â€?When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, donâ€™t trade anymore-we win big. Itâ€™s easy! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2018China initially reacts with cautious criticism, urging the United States to abide by multilateral trade rules and do nothing to damage the fragile global economic recovery. Reactions are most furious in Europe where Trump's announcement triggers a sharp backlash, including threats of retaliation.To prevent other countries from successfully challenging his move through the World Trade Organization, Trump argues that his plan is based on national security concerns. International treaties state that a country may claim exceptions from its trade obligations if national security is at stake. Trump later defends the measures, arguing that his national security reasoning is justified because the United States needs to produce more steel and aluminum for its defense sector.President Trump speaks to reporters before boarding Marine One. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)His critics doubt that national security concerns are at the core of the measures, however, and Trump himself implies that the tariffs are designed to punish China for what the president considers an unfair trade relationship. In the past, Trump has repeatedly referred to cybertheft and a Chinese rule that forces U.S. companies to hand over proprietary technology if they seek to gain access to the Chinese market.March 8: Trump offers temporary tariff exemptions for Canada and MexicoOn March 8, Trump partially reverses his tough stance. Administration officials announce that the president will offer Canada and Mexico temporary exemptions from new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.Mid-March: U.S. resistance to the tariffs plan is on the riseWith Trump continuing to insist that the measures will apply to China and U.S. allies except Mexico and Canada, Republicans in Congress start to demand narrower measures to avoid an outright confrontation with major U.S. trade partners such as the European Union. U.S. trade associations join the protest, warning that any confrontation over tariffs with China would be â€œharmfulâ€? to Americans.The president repeatedly takes to Twitter in the following days to reassure U.S. companies and consumers that the confrontation with China will instead end up benefiting Americans. â€œWe cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country,â€? he writes on March 14.We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country! â€” Donald J.

"With all the recent hostilities, it's easy to forget that China and the United States have been top trading partners for years.In 2015, China overtook Canada as the United States' largest trading partner, boasting nearly $500 billion in total imports and exports, about 15 percent of total U.S. trade. The United States, on the other hand, has been China's top trading partner since the 1990s, overtaking Hong Kong as the largest importer of Chinese merchandise goods in 1998.While trade relations between the two economic powerhouses have not always been smooth, they changed dramatically Friday, when Washington imposed the first wave of tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods, prompting an immediate retaliation from Beijing. If President Trumpâ€™s threats throughout May and June are to be taken seriously, nearly a third of Chinese imports to the United States could be affected by tariffs in coming months.The period leading up to this week has been â€œvery significant,â€? said Mary Lovely, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and economics professor at Syracuse University. '[This period] represents a fundamental retreat by the leader of the global trading system,â€? she said, â€œIt will be seen as a turning point.â€?Even as a candidate, Trump made clear that he planned on significantly renegotiating trade relations with China. In a 2015 speech announcing his candidacy, Trump mentioned China 21 times, arguing that the country was taking American jobs and â€œrippingâ€? the U.S. economy. Throughout his campaign, he pledged to correct the growing trade deficit between the two countries by levying high taxes, though, for a period, this seemed more like tough talk than action.On Friday, the endless threat of tariffs became a reality. It is not clear what will happen next, but the fallout from this first round of tariffs is already starting to emerge, analysts say. â€œThe key is whether there will be more â€” a second round of revenge and retaliation and a third round,â€? said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, to The Post.For anyone looking to learn how this became a â€œcode redâ€? situation, as Lovely described, here is an overview of major events:Jan. 22 â€” Trump imposes a new tax on solar panels â€” a key Chinese exportIn his first major trade-related move of the year, Trump introduced tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. For solar panels, the tax will start at 30 percent for the first year before falling to half of that over four years. The decision was not received well by China, which produces 65 percent of the worldâ€™s solar modules.[The first layoffs from Trumpâ€™s tariffs are here]March 1 â€” Trump hikes tariffs on steel and aluminum importsAfter months of threatening to do so, Trump raises import taxes on steel and aluminum by 25 percent and 10 percent, respectively. While only 6 percent of these U.S. imports come from China, the country responds with a stern warning: A Chinese spokeswoman says at a news conference that Beijing â€œwill take proper measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.â€?April 2-6 â€” China proposes tariffs against the United States, sparking week-long tit-for-tat that significantly escalates tensionsOn April 2, China issues tariffs on $2.4 billion in U.S. exports. This list of 128 goods rivals the $2.7 billion worth of Chinese steel and aluminum imports that the Trump administration decided to tax in March. The list also targets agricultural products such as pork, which would disproportionately affect U.S. farmers.The Trump administration retaliates April 3 by unveiling a list of 1,300 Chinese goods that could be hit with 25 percent tariffs. The list, which has a value of about $50 billion, includes goods such as semiconductors, medical devices and flat-screen televisions. These are nearly all examples of the kind of sophisticated technology that China is targeting through its â€œMade in China 2025' plan.On April 4, China responds to U.S. tariffs by producing its own list of 106 American goods, including soybeans, cars and airplanes, that could be subject to tariffs of 25 percent.A day later, Trump orders his chief trade negotiator, Robert E. Lighthizer, to consider expanding tariffs to an additional $100 billion in Chinese imports but stops short of confirming any new duties. Chinaâ€™s Commerce Ministry says the next morning that China will fight Trumpâ€™s proposed tariffs â€œat any cost.â€?April 16 â€” U.S. Commerce Department bans exports to Chinese telecom company ZTEThe United States implements a seven-year ban on exports to the Chinese telecom company ZTE after learning it did not abide by the rules of a previous settlement agreement.The company had first been penalized in May 2017 for illegally exporting U.S. goods to North Korea and Iran, in violation of trade sanctions. It agreed to a settlement with the United States, which required it to pay $1.19 billion in fines and punish the employees involved in violating the sanctions. After learning that ZTE had not actually punished those involved, the Commerce Department says it will bar all U.S. firms from selling key parts such as microchips to the company.A ZTE research and development center in Beijing on June 13. (Jason Lee/Reuters)May 13 â€” In an about-face, Trump tweets that U.S. will help revive ZTEEarly in May, ZTE announces it plans to â€œcease major operating activitiesâ€? because of financial losses caused by the U.S. ban.In response, Trump tweets May 13 that he is working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to get ZTE back into business. â€œToo many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!â€? he said.Reports emerge around this time that the Trump administration was working to obtain trade-related concessions from China in exchange for helping ZTE, but the abrupt shift in Trumpâ€™s position still catches trade advisers off-guard. Some national security officials also raise concerns that selling U.S. technology to ZTE might pose cybersecurity threats.â€œAmericaâ€™s national security must not be used as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations,â€? Democratic senators wrote in a letter to Trump. â€œOffering to trade American sanctions enforcement to promote jobs in China is plainly a bad deal for American workers and for the security of all Americans.â€?[A trade war with China could hit these communities hardest]June 7 â€” Trump administration eases ban on ZTELess than a month after it went into effect, the seven-year ban on selling U.S. goods to ZTE comes to an end. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross tells CNBC that in place of the ban, the company will pay a $1 billion fine and accommodate a new compliance team staffed by U.S. experts.June 15 â€” Trump announces 25 percent tariff on $50 billion of Chinese goods. China responds with a targeted retaliation.Three weeks after saying the proposes tariffs were â€œon hold,â€? the Trump administration releases an updated list of 1,100 Chinese products that will be subject to a 25 percent tax. The governmentâ€™s threats, first made in the week-long tit-for-tat in April, will be actualized on July 6.More than 90 percent of the items in this list are intermediate inputs or capital equipment, meaning they are items U.S. firms import to assemble end products. In other words, the tariffs slated to go into effect will adversely affect American businesses and raise prices for American consumers, experts at the Peterson Institute warned.China responds by issuing a revised list of $50 billion in U.S. products that will be subject to tariffs starting July 6, as well. The list disproportionately targets the U.S. agriculture sector, particularly in places where there is a strong Trump voter base. As Ted Mellnik and Kevin Uhrmacher mapped out for The Washington Post, â€œtariff-exposed jobs are more than twice as likely to fall in counties that voted for Republican Donald Trump in 2016 than in counties won by Democrat Hillary Clinton.â€?June 18 â€” Trump threatens to impose tariffs on additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goodsTrump says in a statement that the United States is compiling a list of Chinese goods that will face tariffs of 10 percent unless China agrees to the trade concessions laid out by his administration. If implemented, this would add a further $200 billion in import taxes for the country, meaning nearly all of the $505 billion in Chinese products coming into the United States would be placed under tariffs. The Postâ€™s David Lynch and Heather Long point out that such â€œa step would be virtually unprecedented in U.S. history.â€?Chinaâ€™s Trade Ministry responds by calling Trumpâ€™s statement â€œblackmail.â€? Meanwhile, the Senate backtracks on Trumpâ€™s ZTE decision, voting 85 to 10 to reinstate a ban on the sale of U.S. components to the company.U.S. and Chinese flags are in place ahead of a news conference by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on June 14.

"I was saddened to read Fareed Zakariaâ€™s April 6 Friday Opinion essay, â€œOn this one big point, Trump is right.â€? It is difficult to justify U.S. farmers and firms exporting to China and U.S. firms and families benefiting from low-cost goods paying for corporate Americaâ€™s trade dispute.Regardless of whatever modest concessions emerge from this episode, trade imbalances will remain. They are driven by macroeconomic fundamentals. The Chinese surplus will decline as the nation consumes more; the United States will be challenged to reduce its deficit by saving more with the growing federal deficit.The fundamental issue is whether the U.S. model of an open, mixed capitalist economic system will outperform the Chinese model of a closed, state- Â­directed economy. We should be taking steps to improve productivity through investment in infrastructure, education, and research and development, pursuing a welcoming immigration policy to attract the best and the brightest, a robust cybersecurity policy and an aggressive competition policy to foster more innovation in industries that have become overly concentrated. On these big points, President Trump is not right.James Wallar, FairfaxThe writer is a former director of the Treasury Departmentâ€™s International Trade Office, Treasury representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and negotiator for the U.S. trade representative during the Tokyo Round.I totally agree with Fareed Zakaria, who stated in his April 6 column that tariffs on China are deserved. However, Mr. Zakaria omitted a very important point: President Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. If we had maintained our commitment to the TPP, we would be in a significantly stronger position in dealing with China. We would be maintaining our strong Asian marketplace regardless of the possibility of the reduction in the Chinese market, thereby pressing China to modify its methods.What we have done is strengthen the Chinese position in the TPP (including the Australian-New Zealand market) while weakening our position throughout the Pacific. This provides the Chinese a dominant position in the market and makes our tariff war with China a losing proposition. It defeats the tariff warâ€™s purpose completely. There is very little incentive for China to change its terrible policies. The Chinese win; we lose.Howard Pedolsky, RockvilleBecause thereâ€™s no way to perform the Heimlich maneuver on the U.S. economy, it may choke on President Trumpâ€™s determination to expand a trade war with China.A crude brawler, the president might recall a long-ago sage who commented, â€œNever get into a land war in Asia.â€? A trade war may be more destructive to Americans than actual battle with Asiaâ€™s largest economic power.Looming economic conflict was reported in the April 6 front-page article â€œTrump seeks to expand tariffs â€?: â€œThe presidentâ€™s latest salvo, moving the worldâ€™s two largest economies closer to an open brawl, is certain to spook U.S. allies.â€?This isnâ€™t a bone in the throat of a restaurant patron. Economic conflict with China will hike prices on imported products. It will cut U.S. exports as Chinese buyers reconsider buying a U.S.-built vehicle, new Leviâ€™s, Midwestern pork and beef, or California fruits and grains.The president again disdains the national interest to pursue unwise policies.

"President Trump addressed the U.N. General Assembly last September and will do so again this week. (Richard Drew/AP)As Chinaâ€™s rapid rise presented a challenge to the United States, political leaders in Washington were confident that the American model for prosperity would triumph over the path pursued by their communist rival.While China sought to win global influence through transÂ­actional, checkbook diplomacy, the United States offered a fuller package â€” not just financial investment but also security guarantees and leadership on human rights and the rule of law.Now, President Trump prepares to face world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly this week in the middle of a fast-escalating, head-on trade war with China. Itâ€™s one that his critics say is being waged on Beijingâ€™s terms, as the president has rattled U.S. allies and undermined partners, looked the other way on human rights abuses and cozied up to authoritarian leaders.The upshot is a growing consensus that the United States under Trump is going it alone â€” a sharp break from the multiÂ­lateral approach that leaders of both political parties have pursued since World War II.Trump believes he is winning the trade dispute with Beijing, contrasting the record U.S. stock market highs with recent sluggishness in Chinaâ€™s economy. Economists warn that he could be underestimating the willingness of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has consolidated power, to play the long game.Beyond that, however, the United States under Trump has surrendered ground in other Â­areas: engaging in trade disputes with Europe, South Korea, Japan, Mexico and Canada; criticizing NATO; and withdrawing from the Paris climate deal, the Iran nuclear accord and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.The United States had long sought to manage Chinaâ€™s rise by pressuring it to become a more responsible global player and engage in multilateral institutions. Now it is the Trump administration that is turning away.Last week, national security adviser John Bolton eviscerated the International Criminal Court, declaring that the autonomous body founded in 2002 in The Hague is â€œdead to us.â€? The White House also announced that Trump would skip three regional summits in Southeast Asia in November, the first time since 2013 that an American president has been absent.In the past, American leaders believed â€œwe could cede an absolute majority of the pie and trade that relative wealth for dramatically increased influence,â€? said Danny Russel, an Asia Society analyst who served as a high-ranking Asia policy official in the Obama administration. â€œBut if we really are reverting to a more primitive barter system, then we lose that. Then we are competing on Chinaâ€™s terms â€” at a moment when China is on the upswing. Very few countries, if any, believe that of the two countries, Americaâ€™s day is dawning.â€?At the United Nations, aides said, Trump is prepared to amplify the message he foreshadowed on the same stage a year ago: a demand for other nations to respect the â€œnational sovereigntyâ€? of the United States and one another. Aides said Trumpâ€™s presence at the U.N. conference â€” Xi is not attending â€” demonstrates his commitment to global partnerships. But the president has consistently sown doubt through his nationalist rhetoric and unilateral actions on trade.â€œThe forces opposing us in Washington are the same people who squandered trillions of dollars overseas, who sacrificed our sovereignty, who shipped away our jobs, who oversaw the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the world,â€? Trump said at a campaign rally in Las Vegas on Thursday. â€œIn 2016, the American people voted to reject this corrupt globalism. Hey, Iâ€™m the president of the United States â€” Iâ€™m not the president of the globe.â€?China has targeted U.S. soybeans in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. (Michael Conroy/AP)In many ways, Trumpâ€™s â€œAmerica Firstâ€? message is one that Beijing understands. Since taking office in 2012, Xi has aimed to return China to a dominant role in Asia, a strategy he touted as the â€œChinese Dream.â€?In doing so, Xi has sought to elbow the United States and other global powers out of what Beijing considers Chinaâ€™s sovereign claims, which its leaders call â€œcore interests.â€? Among them are the South China Sea, a crucial shipping corridor over which China has asserted maritime control, and Taiwan, the target of an intensifying campaign by Beijing to isolate the island diplomatically.At the same time, China has signaled it would do business with other nations without calling for reforms of their style of governance or pressuring them on human rights.China unveiled a trade agreement in Southeast Asia called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which lacks the type of labor and environmental protections that marked the TPP, envisioned as a higher-standard, 12-nation agreement, sans China, to reduce tariffs and establish new regulatory structures.Chinese leaders also launched an ambitious â€œBelt and Roadâ€? foreign investment program aimed at distributing tens of billions of dollars in infrastructure loans to countries, drawing them into Beijingâ€™s political sphere.The other countries â€œdo not necessarily want Chinese influence,â€? said Bonnie Glaser, a China analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. â€œBut if thereâ€™s not an alternative, they will take the risk of longer-term economic dependence and maybe even growing debt in order to get the short-term benefits. I worry about that.â€?In recent months, nations have wrestled with the consequences of accepting Chinaâ€™s economic largesse. Malaysia canceled two giant projects funded with Chinese cash over fears that they would bankrupt the country. By contrast, El Salvador, eager to cash in with Beijing, severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan â€” drawing a rebuke from the White House.â€œCountries seeking to establish or expand relations with China in order to attract state-directed investment . . . may be disappointed over the long run,â€? White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. â€œAround the world, Â­governments are waking up to the fact that Chinaâ€™s economic inducements facilitate economic dependency and domination, not partnership.â€?But analysts said it will be difficult for the adminÂ­istration to pressure other Â­countries into turning away from China.Several weeks ago, the State Department temporarily recalled three ambassadors from Latin America countries that cut relations with Taiwan. That came as Xi was playing host to the leaders of 53 African nations in Beijing and pledging a new $60 billion investment and loan package for the continent.â€œTheyâ€™ll have a hard time pushing countries to make a choice,â€? said Brian Klein, a former State Department official who served in China and India. â€œChinaâ€™s throwing around a lot of money.â€?White House allies praised the harder line Trump has taken with Beijing. Daniel Blumenthal, an Asia policy official at the Pentagon in the George W. Bush administration, complimented the administration for strengthening security ties with Japan and confronting the North Korean nuclear threat.On human rights, however, Blumenthal said Trump had missed an opportunity by failing to condemn the imprisonment of an estimated 1 million Uighur Muslims languishing in â€œreeducation campsâ€? in western China. The president also has said nothing in public about the persecution of more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, which the United Nations labeled â€œethnic cleansing.â€?â€œThe Chinese want to do a lot of business and diplomacy in Muslim-majority countries, and if you highlight a massive abuse of human rights, China would have to answer to that,â€? said Blumenthal, now a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.For countries assessing how to engage with the two economic behemoths, the uncertainty rests in the open question of whether Trumpâ€™s trade war is a tactical play to boost U.S. exports or a more strategic effort to punish China and make the American economy less reliant on its rival, said David Dollar, a Brookings Institution scholar.On Fox News on Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the administration is determined to force China â€œto behave in a way that if you want to be a power, a global power,â€? the country must respect â€œthe fundamental principles of trade around the world â€” fairness, reciprocity.â€?But Dollar, who served as a Treasury Department emissary to China from 2009 to 2013, said: â€œI donâ€™t think the administration knows clearly what itâ€™s doing. Other countries are confused. Weâ€™ve launched a lot of trade measures against other countries and sent a signal of withdrawal from the world.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chinese President Xi Jinping, right, shakes hands with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a meeting on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia, on Sept. 12. (Xie Huanchi/Xinhua/AP)Since trade tensions between the United States and China began to soar this year, Chinaâ€™s markets have lost 20 percent, its currency has wobbled and exports have decelerated.But China is gaining something else: friends.Under pressure from President Trumpâ€™s tariff war, China has embarked on a charm offensive on the diplomatic circuit, smoothing over old disputes and courting partners who could help Beijing weather the storm with Washington. Germany, which perennially harangued Beijing over market access restrictions, recently let Chinese investors hold bigger shares in joint ventures in a significant concession. South Korea, the target of withering Chinese boycotts last year over its deployment of a U.S. missile defense system, is seeing Chinese tourism revenue and automobile sales return.This week, Chinaâ€™s relations with its heavyweight neighbor, Japan, reached its highest level in years. After meeting at a summit in Russia, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced that China will welcome Abe on his first state visit to Beijing next month after he was frozen out for years over territorial disputes and the Japanese leaderâ€™s visits to a controversial shrine for wartime dead. The two men smiled for a photo together, a stark turnaround from four years ago, when they could barely face each other for a memorably grim snap.During their meeting, Xi told Abe that the two countries should â€œfirmly defend multilateralism, the free trade system and the rules of the World Trade Organisation to push forward an open global economy,â€? according to Chinaâ€™s state-run Xinhua News Agency. Later, a Japanese foreign ministry official told the Mainichi Shimbun that Japan could play a â€œmediatingâ€? role in the ongoing China-U.S. dispute.Although Trump has yet to confront Japan as he has China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union, the United States' most critical ally in the Pacific could be in his sights next. The White House has been weighing tariffs of up to 25 percent on autos and car parts, and the president said this month that he plans to tell Japanese leaders â€œhow much they have to payâ€? â€” at the risk of straining the relationship.The U.S. â€œstrategic rivalryâ€? with China has had other secondary effects. The Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army this month participated in Russiaâ€™s biggest military drills since the Soviet era, while Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin sipped vodka at a summit in their latest display of brotherhood. The Global Times, a hawkish Chinese state-run newspaper, quickly pointed a finger at Washington.â€œWhile China-Russia relations are well-developed, they both have a twisted relationship with a distant major power,â€? it said in an editorial. â€œOther countries should rethink why they canâ€™t become good friends with Beijing and Moscow.â€?To be sure, itâ€™s not clear that Chinaâ€™s whirlwind diplomacy will lead to lasting alliances. Its disputes with neighbors such as South Korea and Japan often involve territory and are steeped in complicated, emotive history. Its frictions with the E.U. over technology sales and market access will probably outlive the temporary camaraderie of resisting Trump. It may now even be wooing India, but few foresee the two Asian rivals settling into an easy, enduring friendship.But as Trump pulls America into self-imposed isolation, Xi isnâ€™t wasting time. He gave a major speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos last year, the first appearance by a Chinese leader, where he presented himself as a champion of free trade and attributed Chinaâ€™s economic miracle to market reform and opening up. Next week, Chinaâ€™s No. 2, Premier Li Keqiang, is set to repeat the message in an address to the â€œSummer Davosâ€? crowd in Tianjin.Li will probably hit notes of â€œshared prosperityâ€? and â€œshared values,â€? but in truth, the message is really about the White House and its trade policies: in other words, a shared threat.Historically, thatâ€™s typically been an effective reason for building alliances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Qilai Shen/Bloomberg)Another day, another round of tariffs.After President Trump unveiled a new list of Chinese goods the United States plans to slap with import duties â€” this time worth a staggering $200 billion â€” Beijing punched back with a somberly worded warning.â€œThe behavior of the U.S. is hurting China, hurting the world, and hurting itself,â€? the Ministry of Commerce said Wednesday in a statement.The Chinese government went on to paint itself a defender of free trade, urging the international community to â€œwork togetherâ€? to protect a global commerce flow that has brought wealth to nations worldwide.â€œThis is a fight between unilateralism and multilateralism, protectionism and free trade, and between hegemony and rules,â€? Ministry of Finance spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.Officials also announced that Beijing had leveled another complaint against Americaâ€™s â€œunilateralist behaviorâ€? to the World Trade Organization, marking Chinaâ€™s 12th such filing against the United States.The document, filed July 9, claimed the United States was unfairly singling out Chinese products and breaking WTO rules with exceedingly high levies.The United States, meanwhile, has lodged 22 WTO complaints against China, accusing the Asian nation of a range of illegal trade practices, including propping up its manufacturing and agricultural sectors with subsidies and effectively stealing the trade secrets of foreign firms.â€œThey have been killing us,â€? Trump said last week at a Montana rally.[Trump implements threat of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports]The president made good Tuesday on his threat to hit an added $200 billion in Chinese products with 10 percent tariffs, including clothing, televisions, bedsheets and air conditioners. Thatâ€™s on top of the higher border taxes on $34 billion in largely industrial goods that took effect Friday.Administration officials said theyâ€™re turning up the pressure on China to stop swiping American intellectual property and to ditch policies that push U.S. companies into divulging their trade secrets in order to enter the Chinese market.Chinese markets seemed rattled by the news Wednesday, dipping after three days on the upswing, with the Shanghai Composite index dropping 1.8 percent and the blue-chip CSI300 index falling 1.7 percent.The $200 billion move came in response to Beijingâ€™s retaliation for the first set of U.S. duties, which primarily targeted farmers in Americaâ€™s heartland, but the new tariffs wonâ€™t be imposed until the end of a two-month period for public comment.Business groups on both sides have said they hope it wonâ€™t reach that point, saying the commercial battle will ultimately hurt workers and consumers.Beijing has pledged to match whatever Trump orders. However, China only purchased about $135 billion in U.S. products last year, so it canâ€™t respond equally to the presidentâ€™s latest action.American firms fear the Chinese government will find other ways to hurt their operations, such as delaying license approvals and ramping up regulations.Chinese President Xi Jinping appears to be treading carefully to avoid a public relations mess, analysts say. The country has vowed to compensate Chinese businesses that suffer from the economic turmoil.And in recent statements, Xiâ€™s government hasnâ€™t insulted Trump directly. The Commerce Ministry has repeatedly pointed out that it responding to U.S. moves in equal measure â€” not playing the instigator.â€œXi canâ€™t be seen as soft on the U.S.,â€? said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at CSIS in Washington.

"Chinese workers spread steamed sorghum on the ground as they prepare it for the first fermentation to be used in locally made wine called baijiu at the Maopu Health Liquor Co. Distillery on September 24, 2016, in Guizhou province, China. (Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)China announced temporary anti-dumping measures on U.S. sorghum, potentially hitting U.S. growers and exacerbating the brewing trade war between Beijing and Washington.Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Commerce said that starting Wednesday, Chinese importers of U.S. sorghum, used by the Chinese for animal feed and brewing alcohol, will be required to put down a 178.6 percent deposit in anticipation of anti-dumping tariffs. The deposits could discourage imports of U.S. sorghum, hurting American producers.Sorghum growers said the measure puts them at the center of a widening trade dispute through no fault of their own.â€œWe didnâ€™t ask for this fight, but now weâ€™re on the front lines of it,â€? said Tim Lust, the chief executive of the National Sorghum Producers, an industry group. â€œFarmers are really stuck in the middle of . . . this much larger fight [with China].â€?The news came a day after the United States banned U.S. firms from selling parts to Chinese phone maker ZTE for seven years. The Commerce Department said ZTE violated an agreement reached after the company was caught shipping U.S. goods to Iran.In a separate development, the Chinese government announced a timeline for lifting ownership limits on foreign automakers. The United States has long demanded better access to the Chinese market.The moves on sorghum and foreign automakers take place amid heightened tension between the worldâ€™s two largest economies. In recent months, the United States and China have exchanged escalating threats of tariffs worth billions of dollars.[In a U.S.-China trade war, who has more to lose?]Hitting U.S. sorghum exports could hurt American growers â€” potentially having an impact on farming states that have backed President Trump.Most U.S. sorghum is grown for the Chinese market, and farmers have planted more acres of the grain in recent years to keep up with demand from Chinese livestock producers. Exports exploded from 2013 to 2015 when China limited its imports of genetically modified corn and sent producers scouring for new feed sources.Since then, sorghum exports have fallen back from their peak. But the crop remains important on the western edge of the U.S. corn belt. The top five sorghum-producing states are Kansas, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma and South Dakota. All but Colorado went for Trump in the 2016 presidential election.[Sorghum farmers are the first victims in growing trade dispute between China and the U.S.]Chinaâ€™s action is seen by some analysts as a warning sign to other sectors of U.S. agriculture, particularly soybean producers, who in 2016 sent $12.4 billion of product to China. Earlier this month, China threatened tariffs against soybeans, pork and other U.S. agricultural products.Li Qiang, chief analyst at Shanghai JC Intelligence, an agriculture consultancy, said this yearâ€™s crop has already been sold but that the news would â€œcertainlyâ€? have an impact on U.S. growers in the future.He said he sees the deposit move as a Chinese response to U.S. investigations into Chinese washing machines and photovoltaic panels. This is â€œtrade frictions,â€? he said, but not a â€œtrade war.â€?Chinese officials said the new measure was the result of a months-long investigation that concluded that U.S. sorghum was being dumped on the Chinese market.Probably not coincidentally, U.S. critics often accuse China of dumping its own products, such as aluminum .Lust vigorously denies that U.S. producers have engaged in dumping and says his organization submitted thousands of pages of data to the Chinese government to demonstrate they did not.But the Chinese Commerce Ministry said that U.S. sorghum exports to China rose from 317,000 tons in 2013 to 4.76 million tons in 2017, while the price of the exported sorghum fell 31 percent â€” harming Chinese farmers.â€œThis approach is in line with Chinese law and WTO rules; it aims at correcting unfair trade practices, maintaining normal trade and competition order,â€? wrote Wang Hejun, director of the ministryâ€™s trade remedy and investigation bureau, in a statement.Because few other countries export sorghum in significant amounts, China will probably turn to other grains, such as corn and barley, to supply livestock producers.Caitlin Dewey in Washington and Yang Liu in Beijing contributed to this report.Read more:How Trump risked a trade war with China, alienated U.S. allies in under 30 daysTrump pushes back on fears of a trade war with ChinaTrade war escalates as China says it will impose tariffs on 128 U.S. exportsTodayâ€™s coverage from Post correspondents around the worldLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moments after the deadline, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued a statement calling the U.S. move â€œtypical trade bullying.â€?â€œIn order to defend the core interests of the country and the interests of the people, we are forced to retaliate,â€? the statement said.The ministry did not specify what measures to expect, but Chinese officials have previously said they would respond with equivalent action against a range of U.S. goods, including pork, poultry, soybeans and corn, and President Trump last month vowed to hit an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods if Beijing did so.The moves mark a historic break with nearly a quarter-century of growing integration between the U.S. and Chinese economies. The U.S. tariffs â€” intended to spare consumers by aiming at industrial products â€” are designed to force China to drop numerous trade practices that the president says discriminate against U.S. companies.After months of rhetorical exchanges between Washington and Beijing, the imposition of the new import taxes makes real a conflict that has rattled markets, scrambled corporate supply networks and chilled business investment.â€œI donâ€™t think this is going to get resolved easily and I think these tariffs are going to hurt the U.S. economy,â€? said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents multinationals such as Coca-Cola, Ford and Microsoft.The potential exchange of tariffs comes as trade-related cracks are beginning to appear in an otherwise robust U.S. economy, according to minutes of the Federal Reserve Boardâ€™s most recent meeting, on June 12 and 13, which were made public Thursday.Farmers fear the loss of export sales as U.S. trading partners like China erect trade barriers in response to Trumpâ€™s tariffs, while businesses across the country â€œindicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy,â€? the Fed said.Even in the steel and aluminum industries, protected by tariffs Trump imposed in March, producers were not planning new investments to increase their capacity, the Fed reported.â€œThe net impact of the trade war on the U.S. economy is going to be negative,â€? Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank Securities, said via email. â€œMost importantly, the risks are rising that the negative effects on the economy of the administrationâ€™s trade war will be bigger than the positive effects of the corporate tax cut.â€?The Dow Jones industrial average rose almost 182 points Thursday, or 0.8 percent, to close at 24,356.74, but remains below its late-January level, when Trump imposed his first tariffs on foreign washing machines and solar panels.Industry groups, which support pressuring China to change its trade practices, are outspoken in their opposition to the presidentâ€™s tariff-heavy approach. Trump already has approved levies on an additional $16 billion in Chinese products, which will take effect later this month.â€œAmerican consumers are one step closer to feeling the full effects of a trade war,â€? said Matthew Shay, president of the National Retail Federation. â€œThese tariffs will do nothing to protect U.S. jobs, but they will undermine the benefits of tax reform and drive up prices for a wide range of products as diverse as tool sets, batteries, remote controls, flash drives and thermostats.â€?Administration officials say that with the economy powering along, and unemployment at an 18-year low, this is the time for the United States to confront China over its long-standing complaints.â€œThe trade relationship between the United States and China must be much more equitable,â€? Trump said last month.The president has long been critical of China, accusing it of waging â€œeconomic aggressionâ€? against the United States. He blames Chinese trade cheating for the loss of millions of American manufacturing jobs.Although the president has often spoken of hopes for making a deal with China, the United States and China were not engaged in negotiations in the hours before the tariffs took effect.Trump ordered the tariffs in response to Chinaâ€™s intellectual property policies, including compulsory licensing requirements that coerce foreign companies into surrendering their trade secrets in return for access to the Chinese market.He also wants China to buy significantly more American products in a bid to reduce the $375 billion U.S. trade deficit.With no official talks scheduled, some trade experts doubt that Trumpâ€™s approach is likely to lead to a quick resolution.â€œI donâ€™t know if there is a strategy,â€? said former U.S. trade negotiator Wendy Cutler, a senior policy consultant at Akin Gump. â€œHeâ€™s been very quick to pull the trigger. I donâ€™t know that he knows how to get off the cliff.â€?Erin Ennis, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said she has been advising member companies to prepare for the additional tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese products that Trump threatened.Those would probably take effect in September, after a required period for public comment.China is moving to pin the fallout on Trump, framing the United States as a bully the Asian nation is forced to confront. A state media editorial this week called the United Statesâ€™ â€œdictatorial bentâ€? a global threat, while officials said China will â€œabsolutely notâ€? take the first swing.â€œThe United States will be opening fire on the whole world and also opening fire on itself,â€? Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said Thursday.[Editorial: Trumpâ€™s trade war with China is over for now. China won.]Chinaâ€™s counter-tariffs appear to be aimed at the U.S. heartland, which helped put Trump in the White House. Farmers in the overwhelmingly red Midwest fear they will lose access to Chinaâ€™s lucrative market and be left with the bill for excess produce and livestock.What happens next is anyoneâ€™s guess, analysts say, since both sides have pledged not to back down.â€œItâ€™s a dark day tomorrow for global trade,â€? said JÃ¶rg Wuttke, former president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.Uncertainty hangs over companies, supply chains and investment plans, he said. U.S. firms in China are reporting spikes in random inspections at ports.One U.S. manufacturer said Chinese authorities on average used to inspect 2 percent of the vehicles it sent abroad. Since June, agents have taken a closer look at every product.â€œDonâ€™t expect the â€˜warâ€™ to be out in the open in some imaginary tit-for-tat tariff battlefield,â€? said James Zimmerman, a partner in the Beijing office of international law firm Perkins Coie. â€œThe real battle will be on the flanksâ€? â€” in the form of unnecessary inspections, product quarantines and heightened regulatory scrutiny.Supply chains will also suffer a blow, said Cliff Tan, East Asian head of global markets research at Japanâ€™s MUFG Bank in Hong Kong. The initial set of U.S. tariffs could rock companies in the technology sector and raise the price of â€œWalmart-typeâ€? products.â€œItâ€™s like a war where everybody points the guns at themselves,â€? Tan said.The conflict over U.S.-China trade has been brewing for years but has intensified rapidly in 2018. On April 3, the United States released a list of targets for proposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, taking aim at high-tech and industrial goods. On April 4, China fired back.In the months since, the tit for tat has escalated, with the United States threatening successive rounds of tariffs on goods valued at hundreds of billions of dollars. China vowed to match U.S. moves, using both quantitative and qualitative measures.Kenneth Jarrett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said that a sense of anxiety has settled over business in the port city.â€œMy hope is that with this start, people will feel that the cost is too great and we will not move on to the second wave,â€? he said.The U.S. president has showed no interest in a last-minute truce. Although he has called Chinese President Xi Jinping a â€œgood friend,â€? he has not expressed any apprehension over what could happen in either country when the first tariffs land.â€œTrade wars are good,â€? Trump recently tweeted, â€œand easy to win.â€?Yang Liu in Beijing contributed to this report.Read more:China is winning Trumpâ€™s trade warTrade war escalates as China says it will impose tariffs on 128 U.S. exportsChina offers to buy more American products, Kudlow saysTodayâ€™s coverage from Post correspondents around the worldLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Leading up to the presidential election, Donald Trump campaigned vehemently against free trade deals, claiming they were bad for American jobs, manufacturing and the economy.Businesses grew concerned about the rhetoric, worrying what the dismantling of free trade deals could mean for their imports, exports and supply chains. In 2017, protectionist trade policy became the top business concern in the apparel and fashion industry â€” a drastic increase over the figures in 2016.The first tariffs were announced in January 2018 on imports of solar panels. But that escalated quickly, to tariffs on billions of dollars of goods among the worldâ€™s largest trading partners.So how did we get here?

"Some U.S. products, mostly steel and iron, face 25 percent tariffs, the same penalty the United States slapped on imported steel in May. Other U.S. imports, from ketchup to pizza to dishwasher detergent, will face a 10 percent tariff at the Canadian border, the same as America's tax on aluminum.Speaking in Leamington, Ontario, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau thanked Canadians for standing united against President Donald Trump's sanctions. He urged Canadians to 'make their choices accordingly' in considering whether to buy American products.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In escalating tariffs, Donald Trump is treading a dangerous and high-stakes path. Tariffs lock out foreign competition, but they also punish consumers with higher prices, disrupt global supply chains, infuriate allies, and impair economic growth. To Trump, though, these are mere bumps in the road to the free-trade ideal that he outlined at the conclusion of the G7 meeting last month in Canada: â€œNo tariffs, no barriers, thatâ€™s the way it should beâ€”and no subsidies.â€?Raising tariffs in order to eliminate them might sound like nonsense, yet it is a tactic that Trump is employing with increasing vigor. In the last few months, he has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, hit China with tariffs on a range of consumer and industrial products, and proposed new tariffs on foreign cars and automotive parts. High tariffs, the theory goes, will give Trump more leverage in negotiations. So far, though, the tariffs have led to retaliation, not concessions.Trumpâ€™s actions are evoking fears of a global trade war. The presidentâ€™s tariffs are often compared to the economically disastrous 1930 Smoot-Hawley tariffs, which nearly doubled the average U.S. tariff rate to 20 percent. Most economists and historians believe Smoot-Hawley exacerbated the economic problems of the Great Depressionâ€”the bank collapses, the stock-market implosion, the restrictive monetary policiesâ€”while prompting other countries to retaliate and thereby slowing trade.While often described as unprecedented, the Trump tariffs are just a more prominent and larger-scale version of trade disputes that have cropped up often over the years. A 1994 study from the Peterson Institute for International Economics looked at 72 cases of threatened U.S. trade sanctions from the 1970s to the early 1990sâ€”including such riveting sagas as disputes with Europe over oilseeds and conflict with Japan over citrus and beefâ€”and found that tariff threats succeeded less than half the time. They were more likely to succeed when the foreign country depended on the United States to buy its goods, the study found, a rare condition today.â€œThere have been times in the past, back to the Nixon administration, where the United States has sought one-sided trade concessions where we say we are going to get more trade and balance things out,â€? says Mac Destler, a University of Maryland professor who studies American trade policy. â€œIn those cases, we have sometimes gotten something, sometimes not.â€?Some of our trading partners have made proposals to try to avoid the new tariffs, but not always to the administrationâ€™s satisfaction. China offered to buy more U.S. goods to stave off new tariffs. Germany proposed to scrap the E.U.â€™s 10 percent tariff on American autos in exchange for our dropping a 2.5 percent tax on European cars and holding off on Trumpâ€™s threats to impose an added 25 percent duty. Argentina, Brazil, and South Korea successfully negotiated to avoid the steel tariffs by agreeing to limit their exports.Yet for the threats to have power, some of these tariffs will have to be lasting, and as retaliatory measures increase, all sides will feel the economic pain. The Trump administration believes that other countries have more to lose and will be quicker to offer concessions. Proposed U.S. auto tariffs, for instance, could chop Canadian auto production in half and plunge the province of Ontario into recession, economists from the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce suggested in a July research note entitled â€œA Sword of Damocles.â€? Yet there are consequences here, too. An analysis last month by the Tax Foundation predicted that if all the proposed tariffs and countertariffs were implemented, they would shave about half a point off U.S. growth and lead to the loss of more than 300,000 U.S. jobsâ€”offsetting about a quarter of the gains from last yearâ€™s tax cuts.â€œThe pain would be felt broadly,â€? says Scott Lincicome, an international-trade lawyer and adjunct scholar at the free-market Cato Institute. â€œThey might hurt more, but weâ€™d still have a gaping flesh wound.â€? And although other countries might have more to lose, foreign leaders might be tempted to continue the trade fights because standing up to Trump is politically popular abroad.The safer approach to opening markets for U.S. companies is to rely on the institutions and tools that have repeatedly reduced trade barriers over the last seven decades. It might be less headline-grabbing than tweeting about unfair trade deals and tariff threats, but the strategy has historically been effective. â€œTariffs and tariff threats tend not to work, but there are tons of areas that are ripe for the picking that have been proven over the years to create reciprocal market opening,â€? notes Lincicome.In the last 100 years, worldwide barriers to trade have fallen dramatically, generally through negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 1947, for instance, the average worldwide tariff was 22 percent. Today, most developed countries have average tariffs in the single digits, including the United States (1.6 percent), the E.U. (1.6 percent), Canada (0.8 percent), and China (3.5 percent). Other barriers have fallen, too, although every country retains some protectionist measures such as industry subsidies, high tariffs on certain goods, and laws restricting foreign companies in certain sectors.â€œThe first and best way to negotiate market access in the form of lower tariffs and lower non-tariff barriers is through a multilateral trade round under the auspices of the WTO,â€? says Raj Bhala, a professor of international law at the University of Kansas. The current negotiations, known as the Doha Round, started in 2001 but have stalled.The Trump administration could also seek smaller, less comprehensive wins by using the WTO framework to negotiate agreements in specific sectors of the economy. If Trump is concerned about unfair treatment of the auto industry, for example, then why not lead negotiations that drop barriers to trading in autos? Thatâ€™s what happened in 1996 with an agreement on information technology. More recently, the Obama administration tried but failed to reach a comprehensive agreement on environmental products. Could a president who considers himself a master negotiator pull it off? We donâ€™t know, says Bhala, as â€œthe Trump administration has not even tried.â€?Then thereâ€™s the possibility of reaching an agreement with a small group of countries. Here again, Trump doesnâ€™t seem interested. He pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership soon after taking office. It would have reduced tariffs on some 18,000 products across 12 countries that together make up 40 percent of world trade.Trump says he prefers direct, bilateral agreements. Yet since taking office, the Trump administration has concluded just one such deal, with South Korea. Announced in March, it made mostly minor revisions to existing trade regulations, and a review by the free-trade Heritage Foundation found that the agreement â€œadvanced several Obama Administration-era policies that do nothing to expand the freedom to trade for Americans.â€?In negotiating free-trade deals, Trump still has plenty to offer our partners without placing the threat of higher tariffs on the table. The United States already imposes tariffs and other substantial trade-restricting barriers on a wide range of products and servicesâ€”from cheese, butter, sugar, and canned tuna to carpets and numerous industrial products. Our laws restrict foreign airlines and shipping companies. Thereâ€™s also the $20 billion the government spends annually on agriculture subsidiesâ€”left largely intact in House and Senate versions of the recent farm bill. All of these are ammunition for negotiating better trade deals.One of the biggest problems for American companies in recent years has been that China, with its government subsidies and forced technology transfers, has failed to protect intellectual property. The answer here is less likely to be tariffs than unified global opposition. At a Weekly Standard summit in May, Trump budget director Mick Mulvaney expressed regret that the administration has not done more to gain international support against such Chinese practices: â€œWe simply have not done a fair enough job of rallying our allies to join us in this so itâ€™s the world against China.â€?Another option is singling out for sanctions Chinese companies that have benefited from illicitly obtained technology. Again, the Trump administration has not pressed on that. In a parallel move, though, it did punish Chinese telecom company ZTE for illegally trading with Iran and North Korea, but eased the penalties after the Chinese government protested. U.S. law already calls for foreign products developed with stolen intellectual property to be banned. There have been about 30 such cases filed this year, though the numbers are on the rise.â€œWhat the Trump administration could do is single out those Chinese companies which are benefiting from that kind of technology acquisition and really make life difficult for them,â€? says Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics. â€œThe Trump administration could work with allies to boycott those particular firms in various ways, denying them financing and banking relationships, and not allowing them to export. To me, that would be much more targeted and appropriate to the legitimate objections than what Trump is now talking about.â€?The 164-member WTO also has dispute-resolution panels. Trump likes to say that the WTO is â€œa catastropheâ€? and unfair to the United States, but those panels have ruled in favor of U.S. complaints 91 percent of the time. Pressing China on its violations and exposing it to the world as a trade scofflaw could be an effective tactic, especially since many of our allies share our concerns about Chinese policies. Instead, the Trump administration is blocking the appointment of new WTO judges, which could leave the panels unable to function by the end of the year.The Trump administration has plenty of trade tools at its disposalâ€”and most of them wonâ€™t damage the economy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(INDIANAPOLIS) - Indiana farmers are caught in the middle of the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China.China is a $320 million market for Indiana pork producers -- more than a quarter of American pork exports to China come from Hoosier farms. That market share is expected to shrink with China's announcement of a 25% tariff.Some economists have argued if China stops buying pork from the U.S., it'll have to buy it elsewhere, and the U.S. can sell to those countries. Bob White with the Indiana Farm Bureau responds a market the size of China can't be replaced that easily.And White's concerned the damage could be long-term. He says a trade war threatens the reputation for dependability that American suppliers work to build. White says it took 30 years for soybean farmers to recover fully from the effects of the grain embargo President Jimmy Carter imposed in 1980 against the Soviet Union in response to its invasion of Afghanistan.And White says he's worried the next tit-for-tariff could hit soybeans, beef, corn and ethanol.(Photo: Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Trade war is far from over. However, the question at the top of farmersâ€™ and ranchersâ€™ minds now is whether our livelihoods will be the first casualties. (Photo: U.S. Navy War College)Earlier this month the U.S. announced another $200 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports. It was a clear signal to China that our government is not backing down and that this trade war is far from over. The question at the top of farmersâ€™ and ranchersâ€™ minds now is whether our livelihoods will be the first casualties.This trade war didnâ€™t begin on the farm, but China has been quick to target U.S. agriculture. American farmers value the trade relationships we have built in this market, but we donâ€™t take lightly having the bullseye of retaliation aimed right at our farm gates.Commodity and livestock prices are already taking a beating during what has become the worst farm economy since the Great Depression. Our crops were already in the ground and on the vine before the first round of tariffs were announced. That leaves us with our hands tied as harvest begins.We could not have forecast this kind of blow to the market, and many are facing lost income as they struggle to hold on. Many farmers and ranchers will be forced to accept rock-bottom pricesâ€”far below the cost of productionâ€”just to repay operating loans and pay other bills. U.S. agriculture needs relief and open markets for our productsâ€”and with every turn of the combine, we are running out of time.For many Americans, this trade war is just a high stakes business deal that seems far off for now. To farmers and ranchers, however, retaliation is already hitting home. Livestock and dairy farmers are suffering lost income with milk and dairy product prices down more than 10 percent in one month and lean hog and live cattle futures down 8 to 10 percent from the beginning of this year.Zippy Duvall (Photo: Colleen Kottke/Wisconsin State Farmer)The news is no better for row crop farmers as soybean prices have dropped 18 percent and corn futures are down 16 percent. Fruit, nut and vegetable growers are seeing similar price impacts and decreased demand due to tariffs. Almond exports in June were reported down from May, including to China (down 48 percent), Western Europe (down 18 percent) and the Middle East (down 26 percent).During the last two weeks of June, Washington apple exports to Mexico were off about 40 percent compared with this same time a year ago, according to the Washington Apple Commission. Farmers also saw costly delays in China with added customs clearing times on arrival going along with the first round of tariffs for products like oranges and cherries, and exporters fear more of the same with the newest round of tariffs.These kind of market swings can mean the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars in farm income. The cost could be even steeper if banks are unable to extend loans to farmers barely able to hold on through this trade war.â€œWe know (President Trump) is focused on the long game...will remain true to his word to look out for farm country in this trade war. Holding onto that optimism can be tough, though, when you begin to watch your livelihood slip away. For today, agriculture needs a win if weâ€™re going to survive to see that future.â€? Zippy Duvall, President American Farm Bureau FederationLetâ€™s not lose sight of the fact that China is not our only ag export market. In countries where we have free trade agreements, U.S. ag exports take off and make significant gains. Between 2003 and 2017, U.S. ag exports to countries where we have trade agreements increased more than 146 percent â€“ from $24.1 billion to $59.3 billion.While, the U.S. has FTAs with only 10 percent of the countries around the world, those countries account for more than 40 percent of our ag exports. Now is the time to bring certainty with our NAFTA partners. Letâ€™s get a deal finalized with Canada and Mexico and show the world that we can be counted on to follow through on our agreements.While the U.S. rains down tariffs on our leading ag markets, the rest of the world continues to move forward with trade deals that donâ€™t include us. Unfortunately, the U.S. removed itself from one of the largest deals, the CPTPPâ€”formerly the Trans Pacific Partnershipâ€”which promises market gains across the Pacific for our neighbors in Canada and Mexico.Americaâ€™s farmers and ranchers cannot afford to get left behind. At the American Farm Bureau Federation, we ran the numbers and supported TPP when it was first introduced. It may not have been a perfect dealâ€”no trade deal isâ€”but it would have brought an extra $4.4 billion a year to net farm income and added more than 40,000 jobs to the U.S. economy. We need more free and fair trade deals like this if U.S. agriculture is going to hold onto its spot as a global leader.Farmers continue to have faith that the Presidentâ€™s commitment to hold our trading partners accountable will go a long way in securing fair trade in the future. We know he is focused on the long game and has been an advocate for farmers and ranchers on many important fronts already. We believe he will remain true to his word to look out for farm country in this trade war. Holding onto that optimism can be tough, though, when you begin to watch your livelihood slip away. For today, agriculture needs a win if weâ€™re going to survive to see that future.Duvall is President of the American Farm Bureau FederationRead or Share this story: https://www.wisfarmer.com/story/opinion/editorials/2018/07/20/trade-wars-didnt-begin-farm-but-china-has-been-quick-target-ag/808752002/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.Billionaire industrialist Charles Koch warned Sunday that Trump administration trade policies could trigger a recession.The conservative activist lashed out at the Republican president's brewing international trade war as hundreds of donors gathered for a private retreat in the Colorado mountains.Koch told reporters during a rare question-and-answer session that 'protectionism at any level' is 'detrimental.'Trump's approach could lead to a recession 'if it's severe enough,' he said.The administration has imposed billions of dollars of tariffs on Chinese and Canadian goods and threatened billions more on America's allies in Europe. The White House last week announced plans to send $12 billion in taxpayer dollars to U.S. farmers to help ease the economic fallout.The conservative Koch network, which has broken with Trump on immigration, government spending, and trade, is promising to punish politicians in either party who support the tariffs.Asked to respond to Koch's remarks, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters cast Trump as 'a free trader.''He believes that the best way forward is for all countries to get rid of unfair practices and move toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies,' Walters said.

"-Analysis-SANTIAGO â€” The trade war between the United States and China is not slowing down. As one economy raises a new barrier, the other repays it in kind.In Latin America, this faraway fight for economic power could have an invigorating though in some ways ambivalent effect. China has positioned itself as a key trading and investing partner for our region. Data from the China Global Investment Tracker indicates that, in the period 2005-2017, Chinese investment flows toward the region reached in total $172 billion (or 10% of Chinese investments worldwide), just exceeding the total value of its investments in the United States in those years.Thus in that time, Latin America and the Caribbean have become important destinations for Chinese capital heading across the Pacific.And while Latin American relations with Beijing are primarily bilateral, triangular relations are becoming relevant and the United States is signaling its hemispheric concerns. The last U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson took the opportunity of his visits in early 2018 to Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Jamaica to warn about what he characterized as China's bid to use its economic clout to 'pull the region into its orbit.'There are profound concerns over a possible return to the 'commodified' model.Seeking to revive ties between Washington and its Latin American and Caribbean partners, Tillerson stressed Washington's long-term commitment to the region, though his declarations did little to create a positive impression of the administration he represented. Meanwhile, President Trump was raising a wall, in part imaginary and built of disdain, to pander to his political sympathizers who wanted the U.S. shielded from various Latin American peoples and economies.Trump apparently sees Latin America as a region that essentially exports migrant groups linked to crime, drug trafficking and disloyal trading practices. The region's political and economic value is emerging precisely in this context, with President Xi's China clearly in an advantageous position compared to the Trump administration. And yet, the economic diplomacy in which China promises mutual respect and benefits, and which has been received so well in the region, is not without problems and challenges. In fact, in several South American countries, there are profound concerns over a possible return to the 'commodified' model â€” with the economy depending on exports of raw materials â€” due to asymmetrical trading.At the China & Latin America and the Caribbean Business Summit in Beijing on May 4 â€” Photo: Li Xin/Xinhua via ZUMAWhile China is a vast market, most Latin American exports are restricted to particular sectors and products. Economic competition between China and the United States could make Latin American and Chinese relations more dynamic, but this could also have adverse effects. For example, if China stops importing soy from the United States, this could expand agro-industrial, single-crop farming in the Southern Cone, contributing to more greenhouse gas emissions and further reducing biodiversity. So the new requirements of the Chinese market may become less than encouraging in terms of environmental protection.This gives Latin America a big responsibility. The challenge is how these countries might strategically approach the spaces opened up by economic conflict between China and the United States.The vast network of small and mid-sized businesses, civil society and universities need to engage more actively in various aspects of this debate. The data cited for example shows that more than 75% of Chinese investments go to the energy sector. This being of special relevance to national sovereignty and security, these capital flows tend to be negotiated bilaterally, which negatively affects the institutional functionality of several regional cooperation spaces.This gives Latin America a big responsibility.In comparative terms, Mercosur won 5% of China's global investments in 2005-17, and the Pacific Alliance, 2%. Yet neither regional block has an explicit strategy to orchestrate these capital flows within a wider policy of renewing its energy grid with Chinese help. This is clearly an outstanding task for regional cooperation.In conclusion, in contrast with President Trump's rather insignificant policy toward Latin America, contemporary China is offering it a future based on negotiation and cooperation. Recognizing Latin America's weight as a recipient of Chinese investments is an important step toward defining new vectors in this economic relationship. The New Silk Road initiative must create an economic corridor to empower the region's productive and ecological balance, and the energy axis is key here. And if words are indeed echoed in deeds, Washington's Western Hemisphere policy will have to be gauged in comparative terms with the actual practice of mutual respect between China and Latin America.For Latin America and the Caribbean, this means regional cooperation that values differences in strategic thinking and promotes territorial economies, from the bottom up.See more from Opinion / Analysis here",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"MOSCOW â€” U.S. officials said last month that they're studying the possibility of introducing sanctions against China, targeted at individuals, in accordance with the Magnitsky Act, first adopted in 2012 to punish Russia. Washington's aim is to pressure Chinese officials to protect the rights of the Uighur minority Muslim population in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.Over the last two years, having declared 'a popular war against terror,' Beijing has significantly toughened the security regime in the region. According to U.S. officials, restriction of religious freedoms and human rights violations have grown under the cover of the fight against extremism. But targeted sanctions by Washington risks further deepening a diplomatic rift over trade policy.U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Laura Stone has vowed to keep bringing up the issue of minority rights with her Chinese counterparts, one of whom responded that Washington should 'put an end to any forms of interference into the country's internal affairs.'The U.S. has long criticized the human rights situation in China, but now members of Congress are calling on U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad to identify the names of specific Chinese officials who could be subject to sanctions under the Magnitsky Act. The law, named for the Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky who died in a prison under questionable circumstances, was adopted in the U.S. in 2012 and reinforced in 2016 to freeze assets and impose other restrictions on individuals in foreign governments who have violated human rights.In December, the law was applied to the former Beijing police official Gao Yan, whom Washington accuses of being an accomplice in the 2014 murder of human rights activist Tsao Shunli.Meanwhile, ethnic Uighurs living in the U.S. have accused Beijing of cracking down on the Muslim community in Xinjiang, with the installation of cameras equipped with facial recognition systems, scanning of citizens' mobile phones for signs of forbidden content, collection of the regional population's DNA and a large number of policemen constantly patrolling the streets. There are also reports of systematic arrests and 'reeducation camps' of hard labor.Beijing has denied the existence of 'reeducation camps' but doesn't deny the toughened security regime in the region they say is aimed at fighting 'three forces of evil': terrorism, separatism and extremism. From April 11-14, Van Yan, a member of the Communist Party's Political Bureau, visited the region and ordered local governors to 'stick to the right ideology, counter harmful thoughts, eradicate extremism and fight poverty.'The article on his visit written by the professor of the Chinese academy of social sciences Xu Jianying and published on the website of the state news agency Xinhua states that 'a tough policy must be implemented in order to get rid of enemies striving to make the country fall apart.' Another commentator, speaking anonymously, talked about 'maintaining the maximum pressure and pursuing an effective policy with the aim of reinforcing the result that has been achieved.'A local source told Kommersant that authorities are fighting against any form of religiosity in the region and hoping, specifically, to undermine the Uighur people's linguistic and cultural identity. One example cited by Ivan Zuyenko, a researcher of the Centre for Asian and Pacific studies of the Far East Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences, was that during religious holidays students are literally locked in student towns. As part of the fight against open manifestations of religiosity, 24-hour shops and restaurants are increasingly forced to closed during Ramadan, although they used to work at nights like everywhere in the Islamic world (during Ramadan eating is possible only after the sunset).The growing criticism of the situation in Xinjiang by the U.S. authorities came as the trade war against Beijing was launched by Washington at the beginning of April. 'Measures taken by the U.S. are aimed not so much at interfering in the situation in Xinjiang as finding China's vulnerabilities and preying on them,' says the Chinese source. But this, in its turn, risks producing an inverse effect: China's authorities may tighten the screws even more to show they will never be subjected to pressure.See more from World Affairs here",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Electric car producer Tesla says it will build its first factory outside the United States in Shanghai.Tesla says an agreement signed Tuesday with a Shanghai city government agency calls for construction to start in the near future. It says production would begin three years after that and eventually increase to 500,000 vehicles annually.The announcement comes amid mounting U.S.-Chinese trade tensions and follows Beijingâ€™s decision in April to end restrictions that required foreign automakers to work through joint ventures with local partners.China is the worldâ€™s biggest electric vehicle market. Automakers are investing heavily to develop models to appeal to local customers.Tesla also has hiked the prices of its cars in China by about 20 percent.Itâ€™s the latest major company to feel the impact of the trade war between the worldâ€™s top two economies.Teslaâ€™s China website now lists the cheapest price for a Model S sedan at 849,900 yuan ($128,500), up from 710,600 yuan ($107,400) previously.At the top of the range, the most expensive Model X crossover is now 1.57 million yuan ($240,000) up from about 1.32 million ($200,000) before.Tesla didnâ€™t respond to a request for comment on the price rises.The company had only just cut its prices in China in May after Beijing announced it was slashing tariffs on car imports from 25% to 15%.That change took effect July 1, but Tesla and other automakers that export from the United States to China only benefited from the reduction for a few days.Global automaker Daimler warned last month that the new Chinese tariffs would hit its profits, resulting in â€œfewer than expected SUV sales and higher than expected costs,â€? which wonâ€™t be completely passed on to customers.China is a huge market for Tesla. Revenues in the country doubled last year to more than $2 billion, accounting for almost 20% of the companyâ€™s total.Increasing prices could threaten its position in such an important market. â€œThis will certainly not be good for consumers or for Teslaâ€™s sales in China,â€? said Bill Russo, founder of Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility.He added that Tesla could lose market share to Chinese competitors, such as NIO, as a result. Russo said NIOâ€™s new ES8 SUV has been positioned as a â€œTesla-fighter.â€?Tesla is the first major US automaker to raise prices in China in response to the higher tariffs. Most big American car companies avoid hefty import tariffs by making many of their vehicles for the Chinese market inside the country through joint ventures with local partners.Tesla, which only makes cars in California, wants to open a factory in Shanghai so it can sidestep tariffs, but the company still hasnâ€™t landed a deal with local authorities to get it done.Tesla is reluctant to enter into a joint venture with a Chinese partner because it doesnâ€™t want to share its valuable intellectual property. Chinaâ€™s long term strategy is to become a world leader in electric vehicles.Beijing said earlier this year that it would allow foreign companies to control electric car manufacturing businesses in the country, potentially opening the door for Tesla.Higher tariffs â€œcertainly will raise urgency for Tesla,â€? Russo said. But he predicts it will still be â€œa long timeâ€? before the company can get approval and build a production facility inside China.Tesla CEO Elon Musk was due to attend a government event in Shanghai on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg, citing unidentified people familiar with Muskâ€™s plans. He will also visit Beijing later in the week, the article said.The report did not specify the purpose of Muskâ€™s visit to China. Tesla and the Shanghai government didnâ€™t respond to requests for comment.Musk has given mixed messages on when Telsa could start making cars in China. In November, he said that manufacturing in the country was still about three years away. In June, he told shareholders that an announcement on Chinese production could take place as early as this month.Musk has said that the factory could produce about 200,000 vehicles a year for consumers in China and possibly elsewhere in Asia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin is looking for answers on how the federal government is going to help Wisconsin farmers as the chances of a trade war with China grow.â€œIâ€™ve been hearing a lot from dairy farmers about anxieties and concerns over the Presidentâ€™s threats of tariffs and the prospect of Chinese retaliation,â€? says Baldwin.Baldwin questioned Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue on Wednesday in committee about how the USDA is going to help not only dairy farmers, but also other crop farmers as well. â€œThereâ€™s very strong concerns about the impact on dairy, but also on some of our specialty crops like cranberries and ginseng which the Chinese have specifically called out as prospects for retaliation.â€?â€œI urged Secretary Purdue to take more steps to provide support for farmers targeted by Chinaâ€™s retaliatory tariffs, address Canadaâ€™s unfair dairy pricing scheme and ensure Wisconsin farmers have the tools they need to be successful and boost our agriculture economy,â€? says Baldwin.Secretary Perdue agreed with Senator Baldwin about the importance of responding to these unfair trade practices, and acknowledged Senator Baldwinâ€™s important work advocating to include provisions in the 2018 government spending measure that gives USDA the authority to support farmers impacted by trade disputes.Baldwin says an updated Milk Margin Protection Program included in the new Farm Bill can offer support to Wisconsin farmers as they sort out how Chinese tariffs will affect them.â€œThereâ€™s a new open enrollment period thatâ€™s retroactive to the first of the year, and people have an opportunity to visit their FSA and see if the improved MPP is right for them.â€?You can find out more online at https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/Dairy-MPP/index",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"President Trump Said Trade Wars Are Good. Three Days Later, He Changed His MindAfter arguing that trade wars were good over the weekend, President Donald Trump dismissed the idea that the U.S. is gearing up for a trade war over proposed aluminum and steel tariffs on Monday.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said that the Administration would not back down from the proposed tariffs in spite of heavy criticism from the world community and Republican lawmakers.â€œNo, weâ€™re not backing down,â€? he said, adding, â€œI donâ€™t think weâ€™ll have a trade war.â€?Last week, Trump announced plans to impose a 25% and 10% tariff on imports of steel and aluminum, respectively. The presidentâ€™s policy proposal has not been formally outlined yet.The announcement sent a shock through the stock market and brought threats and rebukes from key U.S. allies. â€œShould restrictions be imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products, Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers,â€? Canadaâ€™s minister for foreign affairs, Chrystia Freeland, said in a statement after the announcement.Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the finance committee, also criticized the idea.â€œTariffs on steel and aluminum are a tax hike the American people donâ€™t need and canâ€™t afford,â€? he said. â€œI encourage the president to carefully consider all of the implications of raising the cost of steel and aluminum on American manufacturers and consumers.â€?In response to criticism that had been lobbed his way, Trump tweeted on Friday that a trade war could be good for the U.S. and easy to win, something analysts and politicians have disputed.When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, donâ€™t trade anymore-we win big. Itâ€™s easy! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2018Trump continued his Twitter tirade over the weekend and into Monday, singling out car imports from Europe and trade agreements with Mexico and Canada.If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there.

"Big companies reporting earnings have described price hikes on everything from soda to airplane tickets to household paint and tools (AFP Photo/JUSTIN SULLIVAN)New York (AFP) - The US economy may be roaring ahead, but American consumers face the prospect of paying more for everyday goods, due in part to trade tariffs.Big companies reporting earnings over the last week or so described price hikes on everything from soda to airplane tickets to household paint and tools.Some of the price hikes are still in the planning stages and not all companies are sure they will be able to make higher prices stick due to competitive pressures.'We have implemented price increases for these implemented tariffs,' said Donald Allan, chief financial officer at Stanley Black & Decker, whose products include hammers, saws and power tools.The 175-year old Stanley expects to generate $190 million more in revenues in 2018 from price hikes, Allan said on a conference call this month.Soda giant Coca-Cola also recently enacted price hikes in North America, in part because of tariffs on steel and aluminum that raised costs of cans and some production processes.Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey acknowledged that retailers were not thrilled with the development.'Clearly these conversations are difficult, I think it's working its way through,' he told analysts this week.'Ultimately the beverage industry is not the only industry that is facing pressure from changing imports and the need to take pricing,' he said. 'That's just partly the general environment.'At paint company Sherwin-Williams, executives hinted at price hikes due to inflation in petroleum-linked commodities.'Our historic practice has always been to talk with our customers first and then the investment community,' chief executive John Morikis told Wall Street analysts.'We are going to protect our margins and we're going to talk to consumers first. And you can connect the dots from there.'- Prices already elevated -Analysts see a number of factors behind higher commodity prices, with US tariffs on steel and aluminum imports a frequently-cited catalyst.But while trade actions by US President Donald Trump have gotten much of the attention, analysts note that prices of many goods -- including steel and oil -- were already elevated before the trade war took center stage.Higher inflation also typically accompanies increased macroeconomic growth, which was estimated on Friday at 4.1 percent in the second quarter by the US government, the fastest level in six years.Inflation also surfaced as a concern in the first- quarter earnings season, but more companies are now discussing price hikes and some companies said the problem has worsened as Trump has expanded the attack to more countries and regions and as the steel and aluminum tariffs moved from threat to reality.JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said it was still premature to view inflation as a major worry.'What makes me hesitant on inflation is not how it starts but that it can rise really quickly,' he said.Economists fear that a sudden surge in prices could spark more aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, which could itself derail growth.- Companies face dilemma -For companies, the issue of how to respond to elevated commodity prices has compelled difficult choices between accepting lower profits, cutting other spending and lifting retail prices.General Motors suggested this week that it expects to eat at least some of the hit from $2 billion in higher costs due to metals tariffs and the strong dollar. GM trimmed its 2018 profit forecast, a move that sent shares diving.GM has managed to offset about half the $2 billion through negotiations with suppliers and hopes consumers will shoulder at least some of the rest, said chief financial officer Chuck Stevens.'To the extent we can, we're recovering that through pricing,' Stevens said. 'Obviously the market in the United States is challenging.'American Airlines responded to $2 billion in additional fuel costs this year by cutting some planned additional capacity and defer deliveries of new planes.These moves will trim $1.2 billion in capital spending over the next three years.Executives said they also hoped to lift prices on tickets.'We see a strong demand for the product, and so we're optimistic that there's the chance to recover some of the cost of the increase in the price of jet fuel,' said president Robert Isom.'But over the long run, it depends on the economy and it depends on how much supply is out in the marketplace.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The long-term impacts on the Canadian economy if the trade war with the U.S. continues donâ€™t look good.As NAFTA talks drag on into the summer and tariffs continue to be imposed on the U.S. by Canada and vice-versa, experts are warning that the worst case scenarios for Canada are pretty dire.â€œFurther moves by the U.S. to initiate a global trade war would, unsurprisingly, be expected to tip all three countries into recessions,â€? economists at Scotiabank Economics state in a report, referring to Mexico as well.Itâ€™s not just Canada and Mexico at the mercy of the United Statesâ€™ trade strategy, either. U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, to which China has threatened â€œcomprehensive measuresâ€? in response.â€œNo other major economy Iâ€™d say is militating for higher tariffs,â€? says Brett House, Vice President and Deputy Chief Economist at Scotiabank Economics. â€œItâ€™s very much about the hub-and-spoke relationships between the United States at the centre and its trading relationships with the rest of the world.â€?The good news, faint though that light at the end of the tunnel may be, is that weâ€™re not at a global trade war â€” yet. But if things escalate from where they are now, the consequences arenâ€™t looking good.What defines a global trade war?While it may seem the ongoing rhetoric of the U.S. president on Twitter is a sign of an all-out trade war with Canada, we havenâ€™t escalated to that point yet.PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, â€œUS Tariffs were kind of insultingâ€? and he â€œwill not be pushed around.â€? Very dishonest & weak. Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2018â€œA trade war would really be a case where relatively high tariffs are being imposed on a wide range of goods that account for a significant portion of global trade,â€? says House. Currently the tariffs that the Trump administration has imposed on Canada are limited to steel and aluminum for now.In preparation for further measures against the country, Canada has prepared a list of goods that would carry a tariff if imported into Canada from the U.S., including a variety of steel and iron goods, as well as an assortment of household goods and foods like yogurt, strawberry jam, mustard, ballpoint pens, washing machines, mattresses, lawnmowers and dishwasher detergent.But China is much closer to a full-blown trade war with the U.S. than Canada is.â€œWhen you see the U.S. post very high tariffs on its imports, and youâ€™ll see other countries retaliating with tariffs, thatâ€™s when youâ€™ll know youâ€™re in a trade war,â€? says Juan Manuel Herrera Betancourt, economist at Scotiabank Economics. â€œNow you have the U.S. imposing tariffs on Chinese goods, which could escalate into a trade war between the U.S. and China.â€?Any country that is part of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and does not have an existing trade agreement with another nation imposes tariffs based on the Most-Favored Nation clause. The MFN outlines the reasonable tariffs one country can impose on another for the import of goods.â€œEssentially the trade war scenario means, the United States would be ignoring its WTO commitments across the board,â€? says House. â€œAnd most other countries would respond in kind.â€?Recession loomsThe bleakest possible timeline would see a full-on trade war with the United States, which would likely result in a recession for Canada.â€œBased on our projections, if the U.S. enters into a trade war with the world, that would shrink the Canadian economy by about 1.8 per cent in 2020,â€? says Herrera Betancourt. â€œThis is compared to 1.6 per cent growth forecast that we have for that year.â€?â€œThat recession would actually begin in the second half of 2019, although the overall growth rate projection for Canada in 2019 is still fairly positive,â€? adds House. â€œThe second half of 2019 would see Canada sliding into recession in that scenario.â€?Canada wouldnâ€™t be the only one to fall into a recession, although the news would still be worse for the country.â€œWhat a trade war would do is it would push the U.S. economy into a recession,â€? says Herrera Betancourt. â€œAnd Canada gets hit twice, right? On the one hand because all our exports now get a 20 per cent tariff going into the U.S., but on the other hand we have about 75 per cent of our exports going to the U.S. So if the U.S. economy is doing poorly, theyâ€™ll buy even fewer Canadian goods, so itâ€™s not good for us.â€?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CNNMoneyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) - As fears of a global trade war escalate, all eyes will be on Beijing this weekend.US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross arrived in the Chinese capital on Saturday for talks with trade negotiators from the world's second-biggest economy.Ross is due to hold meetings on Sunday, before departing Beijing on Monday, a US Commerce Department official told CNN. The official would not provide any more information about the meetingsThe negotiations come after a rocky week during which the United States tore up a tentative trade truce with China and hit Canada, Mexico and the European Union with big tariffs on metal imports. All three will retaliate.What are the talks about?Washington and Beijing have been exchanging threats for months, announcing plans for tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of each others' exports.President Donald Trump wants China to engineer huge cuts in its $375 billion trade surplus in goods with its biggest trading partner.At the last round of talks in Washington, China pledged to significantly boost its purchases of American goods and services.Senior US officials have said that during the Beijing visit, Ross will be seeking commitments on how that will happen in areas such as energy and agriculture.But experts are skeptical that the United States will be able to get China to do enough to significantly close the huge trade gap.Other big US demands may also be on the table.Speaking on Thursday, Ross said the objectives of the Trump administration hadn't changed.'Our basic objectives with China are to sell them more product, get less in the way of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers, and then ultimately, and most importantly ... deal with the problems of intellectual property, technology transfers, the whole litany of high-tech things,' he told CNBC.The United States is pressing Beijing to move away from industrial policies that critics say subsidize Chinese companies on the global stage and pressure foreign firms to hand over key technologies.US officials are particularly concerned about 'Made in China 2025,' which seeks to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into high-tech industries like robotics, electric cars and computing with the aim of becoming a global leader in those fields.Analysts say China is unlikely to budge on those plans, which it sees as crucial for developing its huge economy.What could go wrong?The Trump administration upped the stakes ahead of Ross' expected visit by saying Tuesday it planned to forge ahead with tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, as well as measures to restrict Chinese investment in the United States.The move was unexpected, as trade tensions appeared to have eased in recent weeks after both sides said they had agreed to put plans for tariffs on hold while they tried to make progress in negotiations.Analysts at Oxford Economics suggested that the announcement was 'aimed at renewing pressure on China ahead of the bilateral talks and the possible North Korea summit,' according to a research note this week.The Chinese government said the move went against the recent consensus between the two countries. It reiterated its stance that it doesn't want a trade war but isn't afraid of fighting one.But it has resisted announcing any retaliation so far. A US delegation arrived in Beijing on Wednesday for preliminary talks to establish the outlines for the weekend negotiations.China previously said it could strike back with tariffs on American goods such as soybeans.-- Jethro Mullen, Alanna Petroff, Steven Jiang and Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First thing this morning, when the market was surging and inexplicably rejoicing in the certainty that Trump would back down on tariffs, a nagging feeling that this was all wrong prompted us to ask 'What If Trump Does Not Back Down', and to follow it up with a troubling rumor from Strategas, namely that this is all about China, and would involve a massive amount of tariffs, to wit:Trump himself has also said that the trade wars have one major target: Beijing, with the rest of the world negotiable collateral damage. Just yesterday, the US trade rep made it clear that both Mexico and Canada would get an exemption from the tariffs once they agreed to a 'fair' renegotiation of Nafta. And beyond the already announced aluminum and steel tariffs, there is another far more troubling aspect, or rather number, to Trump's protectionist push noted by Strategas. The number is $1 trillion. Here is Strategas: President Trump is considering imposing tariffs on Chinese goods in response to China stealing US intellectual property. This is often referred to as Section 301 and President Trump specifically mentioned this action in both his Davos and State of the Union speeches. The rumor around DC is that the US will impose $1 trillion of tariffs, which would shock financial markets. We believe the $1 trillion number is too high. Since the US imports $450bn from China, across the board tariffs would need to be 200 percent. Even for Trump that is too much. But given the magnitude of what is being discussed, China would need to respond. If Strategas is correct, and if Trump's ultimate intention is to hit China with tariffs in the 'hundreds of billions' (or more), it's on, and the resulting trade wars will promptly cripple all China-facing US corporations first, followed by the rest of the S&P.This afternoon, with the unexpected resignation of Gary Cohn, this was partially confirmed, however the full confirmation that it was indeed, all about China, came moments after the Cohn news, when Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is considering clamping down on Chinese investments in the U.S. by slapping tariffs on a broad range of its imports in response to alleged intellectual-property theft, according to people familiar with the matter.The U.S. actions would result from the U.S. Trade Representativeâ€™s 301 investigation into China IP practices, and will hardly be a surprise now that Trump's chief trade advisor is Peter Navarro, author of such books as 'Death by China' and 'Crouching Tiger: What Chinaâ€™s Militarism Means for the World'As Bloomberg adds, under the most severe scenario being considered, the U.S. could impose tariffs on a wide range of Chinese imports, from shoes to consumer electronics.Additionally, the White House could combine the tariffs with restrictions on Chinese investments in the U.S., which are reviewed for national-security risks by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., the Bloomberg sources said. The U.S. is also considering a more targeted approach that would seek to rein in Chinese investmentsFurthermore, the White House is looking at ways to enforce reciprocity with China on foreign investment, meaning the U.S. would only allow takeovers in sectors that U.S. companies can access in China.There is still a chance that a trade mushroom cloud could be avoided: officials told Bloomberg that they are still examining various options, and USTR could decide to do nothing.However, when the announcement is made, sometime in April, we doubt it will be nothing. In fact, we are quite confident that when the dust settles, Beijing will be quite furious at Washington.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The White House is preparing to unveil $50 billion worth of tariffs on more than 100 different types of Chinese goods Thursday at 12:30 pm ET - what President Trump has characterized as a response to China's larcenous Intellectual Property practices (and, quite possibly, a preemptive strike as China prepares to launch its petroyuan contracts next week).This is how UBS' Chief US Economic Paul Donovan summarized what is coming:US President Trump is expected to announce a tax increase for US consumers who have dared to purchase goods that have been partially made in China. There is likely to be a large US flag, suitably photogenic and smiling American workers and a dramatic signature. And selective tariffs, investment restrictions and visa limits. US Trade Representative Lighthizer said that an 'algorithm' was used to maximize the pain to China and minimize the pain to US consumers (this acknowledges that there is pain for US consumers). Trade data (presumably the algorithm input) is complex and often out of date. Saying the word 'algorithm' in an authoritative voice does not magically reduce the risks.The tariffs will be imposed under Section 301 of the 1974 US Trade Act and focus on Chinese high-tech goods. There will also be restrictions on Chinese investments in the US, said US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. China's apparel industry may also be hit. For years, China has forced US companies to turn over valuable source code and other intellectual property as the price of gaining entry to one of the world's 'most lucrative developing markets.' But Trump and his protectionist allies have argued that this is a blatant violation of WTO rules.Back in August, Trump ordered the Commerce Department to launch an investigation into Chinese trade practices under Section 301 - which was regularly invoked by the Reagan administration to punish Japanese exporters.Meanwhile, as China prepares for a full-fledged 'trade war' with Washington, the leaders of the world's second-largest economy are seeking to shore up support for their position from other nations and world trade bodies. China has zeroed in on US export caps as one reason for the widening trade deficit between the world's two largest economies.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said it was unfair to criticize China's trade practices if the United States wonâ€™t sell to China what it wants to buy, referring to US export controls on some high-tech products, per Reuters.'How many soybeans should China buy that are equal to one Boeing aircraft? Or, if China buys a certain number of Boeing aircraft shReutersould the U.S. buy an equal number of C919s?' Hua said, mentioning Chinaâ€™s new self-developed passenger jet. However, China still hopes it can hold constructive talks with the United States in a spirit of mutual respect to seek a win-win solution, she added.US agricultural exports to China stood at $19.6 billion last year, with soybean shipments accounting for $12.4 billion. Chinese penalties on US soybeans will especially hurt Iowa, a state that backed Trump in the 2016 presidential elections and is home to US Ambassador to China Terry Branstad.Boeing could also find itself in China's crosshairs, particularly as the country's aerospace program is seeking to develop the C919 as a domestic rival to Boeing's jets.Boeing, which has the biggest market share in China of any aerospace company, said last year it expects China to buy more than 7,000 Boeing jets worth some $1.1 trillion over the 20 years between now and 2036.Chinese officials repeated threats that their retaliation would be swift.'With regards to the Section 301 investigation, China has expressed its position on many occasions that we resolutely oppose this type of unilateral and protectionist action by the U.S.,' the Commerce Ministry said on Thursday. 'China will not sit idly by while legitimate rights and interests are hurt. We must take all necessary measures to firmly defend our rights and interests.'Jacob Parker, Beijing-based vice president of China operations at the US-China Business Council, said the group wanted to know what action the US administration wants China to take to improve protection for intellectual property, and over forced technology transfer.Parker said China needs to adopt a tougher deterrent against counterfeiting and IP theft, and do away with joint venture and business licensing requirements that can be used to mandate technology transfers to gain market access.'Itâ€™s really important for them to lay that out so that we have a strategy going forward and itâ€™s not just tariffs for tariffsâ€™ sake.'China celebrated a WTO decision, released Wednesday, declaring Obama-era anti-subsidy tariffs illegal under WTO rules as validation of its claims:.'The Chinese side never wants to fight a trade war with anybody, but if we are forced to, we will not hide from it,' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying warned on Wednesday. Beijing will 'definitely take firm and necessary countermeasures to defend its legal rights,' she said, as quoted by Chinaâ€™s Global Times. Meanwhile, the Commerce Ministry said in a statement that Vice-Minister Wang Shouwen had slammed Trumpâ€™s new wave of protectionism at an informal meeting of ministers from 50 World Trade Organization (WTO) member-states in India earlier this week. 'Trade restriction measures will not only hurt the global trade order but also cause serious damage to the multilateral trade system,' Wang said, urging all countries to 'support the global multilateral trade system and defend the authority and effectiveness of WTO rules.' The Commerce ministry welcomed Wednesdayâ€™s WTO ruling against Obama-era anti-subsidy tariffs on Chinese goods. The decision 'proves that the US side has violated WTO rules, repeatedly abused trade remedy measures, which has seriously damaged the fair and just nature of the international trade environment and weakened the stability of the multilateral trading system,' the statement said.China's shift to a consumption-based economy has made it less dependent on exports - so the $50 billion tariffs imposed by the US likely won't have much of an impact. But Moodyâ€™s Investors Service said the impact would be far greater if the US significantly expands tariffs and throws in broad-ranging protectionist measures.If that comes to pass, China could retaliate against US companies, cancelling orders for Boeing planes and nixing a pending deal for Qualcomm to acquire NXP Semiconductors. It could also foil Tesla's push to build a factory on the mainland.But as China hopes an amicable solution might be worked out, the boost to Trump's popularity since announcing the steel and aluminum tariffs (which are incredibly popular among ordinary working Americans, even as they've turned pundits and 'experts' apoplectic with rage) has emboldened him to seek a more aggressive tack.And now we wait for Trump's official launch of trade war with China just after noon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If thereâ€™s a trade war between the U.S. and China, donâ€™t blame Donald Trump, says The Wall Street Journal's Greg Ip: China started it long before he became president.While definitely not toeing the line of the mainstream media's ubiquitous 'Trump is an idiot' narrative, Ip explains below that, if they're honest with themselves, even free traders and internationalists agree Chinaâ€™s predatory trade practices - which include forcing U.S. business to transfer valuable technology to Chinese firms and restricting access to Chinese markets - are undermining both its partners and the trading system.Mr. Trumpâ€™s China crackdown is risky, but itâ€™s on firmer legal, political and economic ground than many of his other trade complaints, for several reasons.1. These products are different: The classic case for free trade predicts that each country specializes where it has a comparative advantage, lowering costs and raising incomes for everyone. If China subsidizes exports of steel to the U.S., in theory the U.S. still benefits because consumers and steel-using industries will have lower costs, and while some steel jobs will disappear, more productive jobs elsewhere will take their place.But starting in the 1980s, economists recognized that comparative advantage couldnâ€™t explain success in many industries such as commercial jetliners, microprocessors and software. These industries are difficult for competitors to enter because of steep costs for research and development, previously established technical standards, increasing returns to scale (costs drop the more you sell), and network effects (the more customers use the product, the more valuable it becomes).In such industries, a handful of firms may reap the lionâ€™s share of the wages and profits (what economists call rents), at the expense of others. Chinaâ€™s efforts are aimed at achieving such dominance in many of these industries by 2025.â€œChina is undermining or taking away some of our rents, so we are relatively worse off and they are better off,â€? says Douglas Irwin, author of â€œClashing over Commerce: A History of U.S. Trade Policy.â€? Unlike Mr. Trumpâ€™s tariffs on steel and aluminum, â€œa lot of economists would hold their fire in terms of attacking Trump for his China actions. I donâ€™t think anyone can really defend the way China has moved in the past few years, violating intellectual property and forced technology transfer.â€?2. The WTO isnâ€™t enough: When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, many advocates thought it would play by the global rules against advantaging its own firms and hurting others. Instead, China does so anyway in ways not easily remedied by the WTO.Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, notes that a WTO case typically requires evidence from an aggrieved company. But many foreign companies are reluctant to complain about their treatment in China for fear of retaliation, such as being investigated for antitrust, consumer abuse, fraud or espionage, or losing sales to state-controlled companies. With no balance of powers or independent courts, â€œthere is no rule of law to constrain Chinese officials from implementing arbitrary and capricious mercantilist policies,â€? Mr. Atkinson and two co-authors wrote in an extensive critique of China a year ago.It is also difficult to hold China accountable for its WTO obligations because its system is so opaque. Mr. Atkinson says many discriminatory measures arenâ€™t published, or published only in Chinese. When the central government, under external pressure, rescinds some discriminatory measures, they reappear at the provincial and local level, he says.3. The U.S. isnâ€™t alone: Mr. Trumpâ€™s steel and aluminum tariffs were widely panned for hitting both China and law-abiding allies like Canada and western Europe alike.By contrast, his ire at China is widely shared. French President Emmanuel Macron has called for a unified European Union policy against Chinese corporate takeovers.â€œEveryone who trades with China faces this problem,â€? Peter Navarro, Mr. Trumpâ€™s trade adviser, told reporters Thursday. â€œPart of the process that weâ€™ve undergone â€¦ is to have a significant outreach to our like-minded allies and trading partners.â€?4. China isnâ€™t like Japan: For decades, Japan, like China now, sought to help Japanese firms by limiting foreign access to its market, providing direct industrial support, and pushing western companies to license their technologies. Japanese companies did catch up in autos, electronics and computers, but the U.S. leapt ahead in new industries such as software and services. Japanâ€™s economy entered a long slump in 1992 and hasnâ€™t entirely escaped. Some say the current panic about China is similarly misplaced.But Japan is different. It is a military ally and is thus sensitive to U.S. pressure on trade. China is a geostrategic rival pursuing and sometimes stealing U.S. secrets for both civilian and military purposes. Where Japan is democratic and transparent, China is authoritarian and opaque.The scale is also different. Mr. Irwin notes that in 1987, President Ronald Reagan hit $300 million worth of Japanese imports with 100% tariffs for its failure to open its market to U.S. semiconductors. That pales next to the $50 billion worth of damage Trump officials say Chinaâ€™s trade practices inflict.â€œNew plays and musicals are often tried first in Philadelphia or Boston before going to Broadway,â€? says Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute. â€œWell, Japan was Philadelphia. Now, with China, weâ€™re on Broadway.â€?Japan was reluctant to retaliate because it valued its political and strategic ties with the U.S. China under President Xi Jinping is turning more nationalist and adversarial, making it more willing to retaliate than Japan was.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With just days left until the May 1 deadline when a temporary trade waiver expires and the US steel and aluminum tariffs kick in, and after last-ditch attempts first by Emmanuel Macron and then Angela Merkel to win exemptions for Europe fell on deaf ears, the European Union is warning about the costs of an imminent trade war with the US while bracing for one to erupt in just three days after the White House signaled it will reject the blocâ€™s demand for an unconditional waiver from metals-import tariffs.'A trade war is a losing game for everybody,â€? Belgian Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt told reporters in Sofia where Europe's finance ministers have gathered. â€œWe should stay cool when weâ€™re thinking about reactions but the basic point is that nobody wins in a trade war so we try to avoid it at all costs.'Well, Trump disagrees which is why his administration has given Europe, Canada and other allies an option: accept quotas in exchange for an exemption from the steel and aluminum tariffs that kick on Tuesday, when the temporary waiver expires. 'We are asking of everyone: quotas if not tariffs,â€? Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Friday.This, as Bloomberg points out, puts the EU in the difficult position of either succumbing to U.S. demands that could breach international commerce rules, or face punitive tariffs.Forcing governments to limit shipments of goods violates World Trade Organization rules, which prohibit so-called voluntary export restraints. The demand is also contrary to the entire trade philosophy of the 28-nation bloc, which is founded on the principle of the free movement of goods.Adding to the confusion, while WTO rules foresee the possibility of countries taking emergency â€œsafeguardâ€? measures involving import quotas for specific goods, such steps are rare, must be temporary and can be legally challenged. The EU is demanding a permanent, unconditional waiver from the U.S. tariffs.Meanwhile, amid the impotent EU bluster, so far only South Korea has been formally spared from the duties, after reaching a deal last month to revise its bilateral free-trade agreement with the U.S.Europe, on the other hand, refuses to reach a compromise, and according to a EU official, 'Trumpâ€™s demands to curb steel and aluminum exports to 90 percent of the level of the previous two years are unacceptable.' The question then is whether Europe's retaliatory move would be painful enough to deter Trump and lift the sanctions: the official said the EUâ€™s response would depend on the level of the quotas after which the punitive tariffs would kick in; meanwhile the European Commission continues to 'stress the blocâ€™s consistent call for an unconditional, permanent exclusion from the American metal levies.'â€œIn the short run it might help them solve their trade balance but in the long run it will worsen trade conditions,â€? Bulgarian Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov said in Sofia. â€œThe tools theyâ€™re using to make America great again might result in certain mistakes because free world trade has proven to be the best solution for the development of the world so far.â€?Around the time of his meeting, French President Emmanuel Macron made it clear that the EU is not afraid of an escalating trade war and will not be intimidated, saying 'we wonâ€™t talk about anything while thereâ€™s a gun pointed at our head.'He may change his opinion once Trump fires the first bullet.Adding to Europe's disappointment, during her visit to the White House on Friday, Angela Merkel said she discussed trade disputes with Trump and that she failed to win a public commitment to halt the tariffs.Meanwhile, Merkel's new bffs over in France are also hunkering down in preparation for a lengthy conflict. French economy minister Bruone Le Maire told his fellow European bureaucrats Sofia during a discussion on taxation: 'One thing I learned from my week in the U.S. with President Macron: The Americans will only respect a show of strength.'Coming from the French, that observation is as accurate as it is delightfully ironic.And now the real question is who has the most to lose from the imminent Transatlantic trade war, and will surrender first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a note written on Monday, ahead of today's latest escalation by the US which unveiled a list of $200BN in incremental tariffs sending risks assets sharply lower and yet which was perfectly expected and previewed both here and elsewhere as it was part of Trump's escalating tit for tat trade war strategy as summarized in this chart shown first nearly three weeks ago...... Standard Chartered's new head of Global G-10 FX strategy Steven Englander made an accurate prediction: more tariffs are coming.Englander first's point is that last Friday, as the original $34BN in tariffs were unveiled officially launching the trade war, is that shortly afterward, investors took a benign view of the first round of tariffs, for three reasons:The US economy has a strong head of steam; Chinaâ€™s economy is somewhat sideways or faltering a bit and its financial markets have been under pressure, leaving the US asset market more resilient The current round of tariffs will likely have small effects The EU is sounding more conciliatoryAnd, as he correctly added, these three factors also provided the Trump Administration with incentives for a more aggressive round of tariff imposition, for the following two reasons:The tariffs so far are politically popular even in agricultural and industrial states Tariff measures are very easy to reverseBut it was his next point, one which we have made numerous times and just this morning again most recently, that was most crucial and explains why the tit-for-tat trade war escalation between the US and China is only set to get much worse:The temptation (primarily for the US but for trading partners as well) is to keep ramping up measures to convince the other side that they are serious about staying the course. Tariffs can be rolled back quickly when an agreement is reached.And the punchline:Because the long-term consequences are likely to be so modest and reversible, the incentive is to move aggressively in the short term. If tariffs are popular politically, there are even more likely to be extended. That said, with so much going on in this week politically in the US â€“ the Supreme Court nomination and meeting with NATO and the Russian presidentâ€” the focus may be elsewhere.It was... for about 24 hours. Then, with the SCOTUS judge in the bag, and with Trump en route to NATO, the UK and Putin, the president decided to lob a bomb and blow up the market's uneasy peace that had hit just settled with 3 days to go until earnings season.The bigger point is that, as Englander adds, 'this cycle will stop when one side or both feel enough pain to back down.'Clearly, the US, with its 'decoupled' economy and the S&P back to 2,800 is nowhere near 'pain', as for China, it is more likely that Xi will first take a bullet than concede... unless of course the stock market crashes and a recession ripples across the country, starting the one thing Beijing is most afraid of: a middle-class revolt (points we made over the weekend).As a footnote, Englander frames the argument as similar to that made by Sam Peltzman with respect to seatbelt usage. He argued (and produced evidence) that drivers would drive less safely because mandated safety devices reduced the consequences of an accident.* * *So what does this mean in practical terms? Well, as Englander claimed - correctly - even before today's $200BN in new tariffs were floated, 'the US is likely to press its perceived advantage', to wit:The US will probably push the tariff cycle further because they see China as more vulnerable. The value of Chinaâ€™s goods exports to the US is almost four times as high as US goods exports to China. The ability of China to implement simple tit-for-tat tariffs on goods runs out at about USD 130bn (based on 2017 imports from the US). The US exports about USD 60bn of services, importing little, so China might match the US further, although taxing services is more complicated than taxing goods. Chinaâ€™s greater exposure, combined with the perceived US economic and asset-market advantage, is likely behind the US Administrationâ€™s view that tariff wars are â€˜easyâ€™ to win.In simple terms this means that if the US extended tariffs to cover a wide range of goods, and - as the case may be - even cover more goods than China physically exports as Trump has bluffed (raising the stake as much as $800 BN in Chinese tariffs), China would quickly run out of room to tax US exports.At this point its only recourse would be to implement additional non-tariff controls, which Englander - and everyone else - views as 'a very serious escalation.'There are of course also other ways China could respond: Tariffs make it more expensive to buy goods, but so do exchange rate fluctuation, sales taxes and other events, like dumping some or all of one's Treasuries to demonstrate irrationality and threaten mutual assured destruction. In other words, 'more expensive does not mean unavailable' and non-tariff measures have far more potential to disrupt supply chains and make goods unavailable, potentially raising prices sharply. That is precisely what China is contemplating right nowThis is how Englander wrapped up his piece on Monday:The very limited set of tariffs imposed so far, and the retaliatory measures by trading partners, are probably not enough to indicate who will blink first. The question is how a much broader second or third round of tariffs would be received.One day later we may be about to find the answer now that $200BN in tariffs has been proposed.However... before Trump considers the latest escalation salvo a trade war victory, there is a 'but': the current enthusiasm for trade measures may be short-lived if prices on store shelves begin to rise sharply, as is sure to happen if a lengthy trade war evolves, with tariff levels ratcheting higher and higher.For now, however, we are far from that point, and as such, the US Administration likely sees going a lot further in terms of tariffs as advantageous.There is just one thing that can stop Trump in his tracks sharply and forcefully: a market crash.* * *As for the big question facing traders tonight, and into earnings season, it goes as follows: will China respond and if so, how? Luckily we know the answer: back in mid-June, Beijing said it would retaliate 'forcefully''If the U.S. loses its senses and publishes such a list, China will have to take comprehensive quantitative and qualitative measures,'' the Ministry of Commerce said at the time.As Bloomberg adds, it is China's Mofcom that has been tasked with formally retaliating against the U.S. on trade, so be on the lookout for statements from them. There's also the daily media briefing by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing, where China tends to double down on its rhetoric in these instances. That's at 3 pm Hong Kong/Beijing time.We doubt China will leave anyone in a state of suspense for too long.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Trump rattled stocks on Wednesday after the Commerce Department rolled out its list of Chinese products, representing $200 billion in imports, that could soon face 10% tariffs Tuesday night - the latest sign that the escalating trade war between the US and its largest economic rival is still heating up. And, echoing recent comments from Morgan Stanley, on Wednesday morning, Bloomberg pointed out that China could soon opt to 'trip up' US tech firms operating in the region, something that MS analysts say could have serious repercussions for US equities which have yet to be adequately priced in by the market, and which earned the tech sector a downgrade to underweight.Since China imports far fewer goods from the US than the US imports from China, the country has threatened to embrace other tactics as part of its retaliation, like imposing new taxes or adding regulation on US companies, slowing deal approvals, or encouraging citizens to boycott American products, the WSJ reported today.Some companies that export goods to China have already reported unexplained holdups at customs or in other areas. And as Bloomberg reported Wednesday, US tech companies - which have led US the US equity market all year as the bulk of the S&P 500's gains have been on the back of a handful of megacap tech stocks - are particularly vulnerable to the Communist Party's wrath. Which is one reason why Morgan Stanley recently recommended that its clients stay long volatility into the summer. As Michael Zezas, Chief US Public Policy & Municipal Strategist at Morgan Stanley wrote earlier this month: 'In equities, our team thinks that US tech is vulnerable as a sector where pricing has been insensitive to trade risks so far.'As a reminder, it is tech stocks that have been the pillar upon which the market's 2018 gains were erected, with just the 5 biggest stocks responsible for nearly all the S&P's upside in 2018.Out of all US tech companies, Apple is perhaps most vulnerable to China's retaliation. While President Trump has reportedly promised Apple CEO Tim Cook that iPhones will be spared from the Trump administration's tariffs it's likely only a matter of time before Xi Jinping becomes frustrated with Tim Cook's ineffectual attempts to act as the tech community's 'chief diplomat' and decides to crack down on the world's largest company.Apple is the master of global electronics supply chains. While the company is based in the U.S., China has arguably become its most important market. The vast majority of Apple products manufactured across China, and the company generated about 20 percent of its revenue there during its most-recent fiscal year. Since launching bigger-screened iPhones in China and striking expansive wireless carrier partnerships with China Mobile and others, Apple has thrived there. The company has increasingly configured some of its hardware and software for the region - at a level beyond any customization for other markets. It also released a gold iPhone to appeal to Chinese consumers, added mobile-payment support for some of the countryâ€™s transit systems, and developed messaging features that mimic popular functions of local services like WeChat. The company has also followed local laws, agreeing to relocate data storage for its iCloud services to state-affiliated servers in China. Tim Cook, Appleâ€™s chief executive officer, also visits China regularly for public and private events.But while the crackdown on Apple remains one eventuality, the Chinese government has a more direct route: hitting M&A deals, like scuttling Qualcomm's planned takeover of NXP. The US chipmaker has little more than a week left to close the deal before its agreement with NXP expires.That chip deal is one of the most prominent hostages of the brewing trade war between the U.S. and China. Qualcomm promised investors that the transaction would be closed by the end of 2017. NXP has given Qualcomm until July 25 to close the deal or their agreement will expire. Qualcomm already won clearance through the investigation phase of Chinaâ€™s approval process, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg earlier this year. The final announcement, though, may be held up amid the high-level standoff over broader trade issues and the fate of Chinese telecom equipment company ZTE Corp. The complexity of politically infused, cross-border acquisition approvals is relatively minor compared to the global electronics supply chain, which binds China and the U.S. and creates domestic tensions for both countries. An Intel Corp. processor made in Oregon or Arizona will often head to Chengdu where itâ€™s packaged for final installation into a computer. That computer can then be assembled for a U.S. company such as HP Inc. by a Chinese subcontractor and shipped to the U.S. for sale. Itâ€™s unclear which parts of this process would be affected by U.S.-China tariffs.And here is why semis are especially vulnerable: chipmakers and other tech companies derive a larger percentage of their sales from China than any other US industry.According to Deutsche Bank calculations, US-based companies have a trade surplus of $20 billion with China if US corporate revenues are factored in. Given this vulnerability, and with the US showing no signs of backing down, the question of whether Xi and the Communist Party will go after US tech giants that they once sought to court is no longer a question of 'if', but a question of 'when.'And if a true tech selloff gets rolling - one that even corporations couldn't stop by stepping in and buying back their stocks...... it's impossible to say where it will stop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Authored by Patrick Barron via The Mises Institute,In a recent post I explained that China's manipulations of its own currency hurt only herself and not her trading partners and, therefore, retaliatory tariffs were not warranted and would be self-defeating anyway. China harms herself by causing her own money supply to expand, which destroys capital through malinvestment and causes prices to rise domestically. Retaliatory tariffs cause American goods to rise in price, resulting in a recession and generally lower standard of living. Few economists claim otherwise.It seems that everyone is in favor of free trade, as long as it is the other guy who must compete with foreign products. When it comes to their own products, the most typical response from American manufacturers begins with the caveat that 'although free trade is beneficial most of the time, it causes harm under certain circumstances.' There follows a convoluted chain of cause-and-effect purporting to prove that lower priced foreign goods would hollow out America's key manufacturing industries and turn America into a second class nation.The purpose of this brief response is to counter these claims and explain why understanding economic theory is vital to the argument in favor of free trade.There are two books which address the fact that we cannot experiment with an economy the way that physical scientists do. We must use logic to form irrefutable conclusions of what MUST happen, even if we cannot see it! The first is Frederic Bastiat's early nineteenth century classic That Which Is Seen, and That Which Is Not Seen . Henry Hazlitt's updated the book a hundred years later in order to appeal to modern readers. His Economics in One Lesson employs a series of short stories to illustrate that one must always consider the economic effects of an intervention on all and not just a few actors, plus, that one must look to the long term effects of an intervention and not just the short term effects.So, let's use logic to consider the effects of China's economic interventions on itself and its trading partners who do nothing to retaliate against China in any way.1. China uses its capital in an inefficient way . Outright subsidies to any industry must be paid by someone. The very fact that China believes that it cannot compete in certain industries to its own satisfaction without subsidies is an admission that these industries are inefficient. Therefore, Chinese internal subsidies are transfers of capital from more efficient industries to less efficient industries. Put another way, if the targeted industries already were very efficient, more capital would flow to these industries and subsidies wouldn't be necessary. 2. Monetary expansion to fund an industry causes overall higher prices and malinvestment . This is the classic Austrian Business Cycle Theory. China may very well expand its steel industry, for example, with monetary expansion, but such action will disrupt the time structure of production and result in a higher price level and a recession. Other factors of production that feed the Chinese steel industry will rise in price, necessitating another round of currency expansion, which will lead to even higher prices and another recession. It's a vicious cycle that can end only with an end to currency expansion. 3. China's overall economy will be less developed, weakening the impact of subsidies to targeted industries . Because capital is stripped from more efficient industries, China's ancillary industries will be less developed, harming the targeted steel industry indirectly. Public infrastructure may be less than it would be otherwise, for example. The many business-to-business goods and services that feed the steel industry will lack the capital to expand. The workforce may lack adequate education. The list is endless. China's economy will lack coordinated growth, as was so apparent in the moribund economies of the old Soviet bloc. The point is that something must be sacrificed to aid the targeted industry. Of course, this is a classic Bastiat 'Not Seen' scenario. 4. American products get cheaper and gain market share . It may be true to some small extent that the steel industry, for example, may not be able to expand and may even contract in the face of equal quality Chinese steel that can be purchased at lower prices. But all the many American manufacturing firms that USE steel will have a lower cost of production and, therefore, will be able to expand their markets. Again, something has to give; i.e., the Chinese may be able to sell more steel to American manufacturers, but these manufacturers can sell more finished goods into the world market. 5. American industries benefit from the general expansion of all levels of production. This is a corollary to number three above but opposite. Because the companies that use cheaper Chinese steel reduce their costs, passing along the savings to customers in the form of lower prices, passing along the increased profits in the form of dividends to shareholder, increased investment in their own firms, or a combination of above. The reason for this beneficial prospect is that America becomes more capital intensive, and that capital came in the form of a gift from China. 6. Chinese subsidies actually become subsidies to Americans' standard of living. The purpose of production is consumption. Although we may give lip service to how much we love our jobs, what we really mean is that we are satisfied with the life style that we can obtain through meaningful labor. I truly doubt that many of us would work if we were not paid. Chinese subsidies allow us the option to work less for the same standard of living or work as long yet enjoy a higher standard of living because our pay goes further. We workers have more options. For example, as we become richer through Chinese subsidies, mothers may opt for part time work instead of a full time job, or they may leave the workforce altogether. Fathers may decide to pursue lower paid but less stressful careers. Let us not forget that leisure is a valuable good in and of itself.ConclusionFinally, the idea that all subsidies can be eliminated worldwide and businesses can compete on a level playing field is a foolish idea. What is the definition of a subsidy? Is it government provided healthcare? How about a state or municipality forgiving business taxes in order to entice industries to expand or relocate? If the government builds a super highway near a plant, is this a subsidy? Likewise, industries in many developed economies decry the fact that undeveloped countries have lower environmental standards, worker safety requirements, and worker rights. Periodically one reads that the European Union is threatening a member for having taxes that are too low and, thus, provide an indirect subsidy.Capitalists must accept all of these interventions by foreign governments as part of the unknown and uncontrollable factors of conducting business and not lobby their own governments to take self defeating economic reprisals. Unilateral free trade is the best and only real option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The debate over tariffs has mostly emphasized their impact on economic growth and jobs, which overlooks specific stories of suffering caused by President Donald Trump's trade war.While President Trump positions blame for trade-war-related pain in America squarely on China: ' China has openly stated that they are actively trying to impact and change our election by attacking our farmers, ranchers and industrial workers because of their loyalty to me, ' Scott Lincicome, senior policy adviser at Republicans Fighting Tariffs via Reason.com, disagrees,Lincicome points out that this is a 'Trump Tax' - businesses of all sizes have seen their input costs rise because of Trump's tariffs. To maintain already slim profit margins, many of these businesses have no choice but to raise prices.But not all businesses can offset tariff costs through price increases, because their customers are price sensitive and will simply take their business to a foreign competitor. These companies have been forced to take cost-cutting measures such as laying off employees or forgoing expansion.Then there are the countless farmers and exporters who have seen their markets dry up as trading partners impose retaliatory tariffs.'47 Brand Hats: The Massachusetts company, which faces higher raw material costs thanks to Trump's tariffs, cannot find domestic suppliers to produce hats. It is considering job cuts to compensate.5th Avenue Energy: This small California renewable energy firm found that lighting fixtures and other Chinese imports are more expensive and harder to obtain because big contractors bought them up in anticipation of tariffs.A-1 Signs: The Tennessee manufacturer depends on competitively priced steel to fabricate products and compete in a global marketplace. Tariff-induced steel price spikes have forced it to lraise prices, hurting consumers and pushing them toward cheaper foreign competitors. If A-1 cannot retain its customers, it will have to lay off employees.ABB: The Missouri electrical manufacturer is considering raising prices for its transformers because of tariff costs, at the risk of being undercut by foreign competitors.Able Steel Fabricators: The Arizona manufacturer says the construction industry will come to a 'screeching halt' when customers refuse to pay the higher prices that tariffs will bring or subcontractors will be forced to eat the increased costs.Accu-Swiss: The California precision-part manufacturer has been forced to turn off the lights while keeping its machines on in an attempt to absorb the cost increases caused by tariffs.Alcoa: The aluminimum-product manufacturer cut its profit forecast ranges by $500 million, citing tariffs on aluminum it imports from Canada.Alfa: The processed-food maker switched to Canadian, European, and South American suppliers to avoid tariffs.All Metals Industries: The New Hampshire metal-service center has been forced to turn down large orders from potential customers because it can't source material due to tariffs.Amber Ox Public House: The Virginia brewer has seen a rapid drop in can availability, while prices have increased.American Keg: The Pennsylvania stainless-steel beer keg manufacturer was forced to lay off 10 of its 30 employees because of tariff-induced costs. It has passed on some of the costs through higher prices, leading some customers to switch to foreign vendors. 'We have a lot of patriotic customers that want to buy USA-made kegs with U.S. labor and U.S. steel,' the company's CEO says, 'but they're only going to go so far as that price difference continues to rise.'Americana Development: The Ohio wheel maker has been forced to raise prices due to tariff costs. As a result some customers have taken their business to Chinese suppliers.Arrow Fasteners: The staple manufacturer cannot pass along tariff-related increases in input costs to customers because they would just turn to foreign competitors. 'We're stuck,' says the owner.AutoZone: Tariffs are forcing the auto parts chain to raise prices on components made with steel, such as rotors and other brake parts.Auvil Fruit Company: The Washington fruit company is being squeezed by its Chinese customers because of retaliatory tariffs. It's faced with a choice between sacrificing sales and dramatically reducing prices to account for the tariffs.

"Steve Bannon - who claims to have helped President Trump draft the battle plan for the ongoing trade war, says that Trump's strategy is to make the conflict 'unprecedentedly large' and 'unbearably painful' for Beijing, according to an exclusive interview with the South China Morning Post.The ultimate goal, says Bannon - is not just to force China to give up its 'unfair trade practices,' but to 're-industrialize America' since manufacturing used to be the core of the nation's power. Bannon also criticized the 'Made in China 2025' plan for Beijing to catch up with the West in 10 key tech sectors - saying that Chinese firms were relying in generous government support to reduce future technological reliance on the West.Bannon, who claimed to have helped Trump draw up the trade war plan, said that in the past, tariffs had been limited to imports of between roughly US$10 billion and US$30 billion but the sheer magnitude of the more than US$500 billion in question this time had â€œcaught Beijing off guardâ€?. â€œItâ€™s not just any tariff. Itâ€™s tariffs on a scale and depth that is previously inconceivable in US history,â€? Bannon said. He said Beijing had relied on â€œround after round of talksâ€? to take the momentum out of the US punitive measures, but the delaying tactics would not work. â€œThey always want to have a strategic dialogue to tap things along. They never envisioned that somebody would actually do this.â€? -SCMPBannon says he and Trump were convinced that the US would win a trade war, and that Chinese elites were worried about the same, with 'so many senior Chinese officials exhausting all channels' in order to move their money out of China and snap up West Coast and New York real estate.'Why [does there have] to be massive capital controls placed on Chinese money? Otherwise all will flee to midtown Manhattan ... They want to buy real assets in the US. That shows you a dramatic lack of confidence in their own economy.'Bannon says he first discussed the idea of a trade war five years ago with then-senator Jeff Sessions, and that the plan to crush Beijing in trade had been at the top of their campaign strategy.â€œThis is where Jeff Sessions and I sat in 2013 as we were trying to imagine what the 2016 presidential election would look like,â€? Bannon said in his â€œBreitbart Embassyâ€? townhouse near the Capitol Building in Washington. â€œWe made trade the top issue, when trade was not even among the top 100 issues of the others.â€? -SCMPWhile Trump and Bannon have had a public falling out since his January firing - with the President criticizing the former Breitbart executive chairman for letting journalist Michael Wolff into the White House for material on his book Fire and Fury, the President and Bannon were back in contact in May according to the Wall Street Journal.During his first meeting with Trump in 2015, both men agreed that the Washington and Wall Street establishment would 'side with China' in the upcoming trade war, and that the two decided to alter the international trade regime to 'dramatically reduce [the US] trade defecit' and re-industrialize America; particularly in the so-called rust belt.Bannon added that Trump would 'never back down in the trade war [with China]' despite anticipating that the policy would face 'massive resistance domestically and internationally' because of 'Western elites' who are working with China to make themselves rich.'Our factories got shipped out of here. Wall Street made a fortune. The private equity made a fortune. Right now President Trumpâ€™s focus is on stopping it,' said Bannon.Apart from imposing the unprecedented tariffs, the Trump administration would use Section 301 of the Trade Act to press China on intellectual property rights and stop Beijing from forcing American companies to transfer their technology to Chinese partners, the former chief strategist said. Section 301 authorises the US president to retaliate against any action that violates an international trade agreement or is unjustified, unreasonable or discriminatory, and that burdens or restricts US commerce. Bannon said Washington should also retain some ability to â€œcut offâ€? some key parts of the supply chain with China when necessary â€“ as it did in the case of Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE. Trump banned sales of American technology to the company in July, almost bankrupting it and putting up to 100,000 highly paid Chinese jobs in danger before lifting the ban. -SCMP'It is very important to the Chinese audience [to remember] the case of ZTE. The central theme of Made in China 2025 is that the Chinese are trying to get off the supply chain â€“ the component parts of the supply chain â€“ of the West. The Chinese are very vulnerable there. Their government should never allow them to get into a situation with all this aggressiveness in their trade policies.'In the end, SCMP notes, Bannon says that the trade war and US tariffs are about more than just the economy and rebuilding American manufacturing:'The elites and the media are trying to convince you that this inexpiable leaving of the factories and jobs is but a law of physics. The opposite is actually true â€“ it is the human action which did it. It can be reversed and it will be reversed,' he said, adding '[The] tariff is about human dignity and human pride ... Not everyone wants to work for an insurance company.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
